In contrast, a\nprocessor's implementation often significantly influences performance, power\nefficiency, and area usage. Therefore, a major goal of instruction set design\nshould be maximizing instruction density and encoding efficiency. This paper\nintroduces the design elements of the Scry instruction set architecture that\nmost significantly affect instruction density and encoding efficiency. Scry is\na novel and experimental instruction set that revisits first principles to\ndesign an instruction set fit for modern processor implementations. Scry uses\nforward-temporal referencing as a means of data flow, where instructions refer\nto which future instructions consume their outputs. It also uses internal\ntagging, where the processors track data types internally, to reduce the number\nof instructions needed and increase flexibility. Combining these two methods,\nScry achieves instruction-feature parity with RISC-V's RV64IMC using only\n2-byte instructions compared to RISC-V's 4 bytes. Scry's instructions occupy\nonly 28% of the 2-byte encoding space, where RV64IMC instructions occupy 68% of\nthe 4-byte encoding space. We show that hand-compiled Scry's static instruction\ndensity is comparable to RV64IMC for small functions and improves as functions\ngrow in size."}

Although recent attempts in heuristics and\nintermediate representation (IR) designs have attempted to address these\nproblems, efficiently simplifying control flow analysis and accurately\nidentifying vectorization opportunities remain challenging tasks.\n  To address these issues, we introduce a novel vectorization pipeline\nfeaturing two specialized IR extensions: SIR, which encodes high-level\nstructural information, and VIR, which explicitly represents instruction\ndependencies through data dependency analysis. Leveraging the detailed\ndependency information provided by VIR, we develop a flexible and extensible\nvectorization framework. This approach substantially improves interoperability\nacross vectorization passes and expands the search space for identifying\nisomorphic instructions, ultimately enhancing both the scope and efficiency of\nautomatic vectorization.

Existing retraining strategies either delay model updates,\nover-commit resources to retraining, or overlook iteration-level retraining\ngranularity.

MACE leverages the insight that not all model updates\nequally affect output alignment and allocates GPU cycles accordingly to balance\nthroughput, latency, and update freshness. Our trace-driven evaluation shows\nthat MACE matches or exceeds continuous retraining while reducing inference\nlatency by up to 63% and maintaining throughput under resource constraints.\nCompared to periodic retraining, MACE improves latency breakdown across\nprefill, decode, and finetune stages, and sustains GPU utilization above 85% in\nNVIDIA AGX Orin.

To\nbridge this gap, we introduce TriMediQ, a triplet-structured approach that\nsummarises patient responses into triplets and integrates them into a Knowledge\nGraph (KG), enabling multi-hop reasoning. We introduce a frozen triplet\ngenerator that extracts clinically relevant triplets, using prompts designed to\nensure factual consistency. In parallel, a trainable projection module,\ncomprising a graph encoder and a projector, captures relational information\nfrom the KG to enhance expert reasoning. TriMediQ operates in two steps: (i)\nthe projection module fine-tuning with all LLM weights frozen; and (ii) using\nthe fine-tuned module to guide multi-hop reasoning during inference. We\nevaluate TriMediQ on two interactive QA benchmarks, showing that it achieves up\nto 10.4\\% improvement in accuracy over five baselines on the iMedQA dataset.\nThese results demonstrate that converting patient responses into structured\ntriplet-based graphs enables more accurate clinical reasoning in multi-turn\nsettings, providing a solution for the deployment of LLM-based medical\nassistants."}

Mobile\nedge computing (MEC), which allows computations at MEC servers deployed between\nEDs and CC, has been explored to address these challenges. We propose a\nmultilayer MEC (MLMEC) framework to balance accuracy and latency. The MLMEC\nsplits the architecture into stations, each with a neural network model. If\nfront-end equipment cannot detect falls reliably, data are transmitted to a\nstation with more robust back-end computing. The knowledge distillation (KD)\napproach was employed to improve front-end detection accuracy by allowing\nhigh-power back-end stations to provide additional learning experiences,\nenhancing precision while reducing latency and processing loads. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the KD approach improved accuracy by 11.65% on the\nSisFall dataset and 2.78% on the FallAllD dataset. The MLMEC with KD also\nreduced the data latency rate by 54.15% on the FallAllD dataset and 46.67% on\nthe SisFall dataset compared to the MLMEC without KD. In summary, the MLMEC FD\nsystem exhibits improved accuracy and reduced latency."}

Phoneme-level analysis achieved superior performance with\nAUROC of 93.78% +- 2.34% and accuracy of 92.17% +- 2.43%. This demonstrates\nenhanced diagnostic capability for cross-linguistic PD detection. Importantly,\nattention analysis revealed that the most informative speech features align\nwith those used in established clinical protocols: sustained vowels (/a/, /e/,\n/o/, /i/) at phoneme level, diadochokinetic syllables (/ta/, /pa/, /la/, /ka/)\nat syllable level, and /pataka/ sequences at word level.

Metrics include Character Error Rate (CER), Word Error\nRate (WER), BLEU, ROUGE-L, F1, coverage, and execution time. On the ground\ntruth subset, Tesseract achieved the lowest CER (0.912) and the highest BLEU\n(0.245). EasyOCR provided a good balance between accuracy and multilingual\nsupport. PaddleOCR achieved near complete coverage but was slower because it\nran on CPU only due to GPU incompatibility, and TrOCR produced the weakest\nresults despite GPU acceleration. These results provide a packaging-specific\nbenchmark, establish a baseline, and highlight directions for layout-aware\nmethods and text localization."}

While recent studies document\ninstances of LLM deception under pressure, most evaluations remain confined to\nsingle-turn prompts and fail to capture the long-horizon interactions in which\ndeceptive strategies typically unfold. We introduce the first simulation\nframework for probing and evaluating deception in LLMs under extended sequences\nof interdependent tasks and dynamic contextual pressures. Our framework\ninstantiates a multi-agent system: a performer agent tasked with completing\ntasks and a supervisor agent that evaluates progress, provides feedback, and\nmaintains evolving states of trust. An independent deception auditor then\nreviews full trajectories to identify when and how deception occurs. We conduct\nextensive experiments across 11 frontier models, spanning both closed- and\nopen-source systems, and find that deception is model-dependent, increases with\nevent pressure, and consistently erodes supervisor trust.

We\nfind that inoculation is also effective across several additional settings:\nreducing emergent misalignment (EM) from task-specific finetuning, defending\nagainst backdoor injections, and mitigating the transmission of traits via\nsubliminal learning. Follow-up analysis suggests a mechanism: making a trait\nless surprising via inoculation reduces optimization pressure to globally\nupdate the model, thereby reducing the degree of generalization. Our analysis\nrelates to prior work on EM: inoculation explains prior findings that\neducational contexts mitigate EM from insecure code. Beyond demonstrating a\nsimple and effective technique for selective learning, our results contribute\nto a better conceptual understanding of how and why language models generalize."}

In light of this fact, quality assessment of dynamic 4D digital humans\nbecomes increasingly important. In this paper, we first propose a large-scale\ndynamic digital human quality assessment dataset, DHQA-4D, which contains 32\nhigh-quality real-scanned 4D human mesh sequences, 1920 distorted textured 4D\nhuman meshes degraded by 11 textured distortions, as well as their\ncorresponding textured and non-textured mean opinion scores (MOSs). Equipped\nwith DHQA-4D dataset, we analyze the influence of different types of distortion\non human perception for textured dynamic 4D meshes and non-textured dynamic 4D\nmeshes. Additionally, we propose DynaMesh-Rater, a novel large multimodal model\n(LMM) based approach that is able to assess both textured 4D meshes and\nnon-textured 4D meshes.

We introduce Compressed Convolutional\nAttention (CCA), a novel attention method which down-projects queries, keys,\nand values and performs the entire attention operation inside the shared latent\nspace. This simple design dramatically cuts parameters, KV-cache, and FLOPs all\nat once by the desired compression factor. Because CCA is orthogonal to\nhead-sharing, we combine the two to form Compressed Convolutional Grouped Query\nAttention (CCGQA), which further tightens the compute-bandwidth Pareto frontier\nso that users can tune compression toward either FLOP or memory limits without\nsacrificing quality. Experiments show that CCGQA consistently outperforms both\nGQA and MLA at equal KV-cache compression on dense and MoE models.\nAdditionally, we show that CCGQA outperforms all other attention methods on MoE\nmodels with half the KV-cache of GQA and MLA, achieving an 8x KV-cache\ncompression with no drop in performance compared to standard MHA. CCA and CCGQA\nalso dramatically reduce the FLOP cost of attention which leads to\nsubstantially faster training and prefill than existing methods. On H100 GPUs,\nour fused CCA/CCGQA kernel reduces prefill latency by about 1.7x at a sequence\nlength of 16k relative to MHA, and accelerates backward by about 1.3x."}

Its goal was to assess\nhow well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt\nthrough local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development\nwithout sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to\nclassify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the\nmulti-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks:\ngeneralization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after\nfine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear\nprobing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes\n(FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and\nExpected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and\nstatistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across\ncenters was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after\nfine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission\nachieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted\nlimitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties\nin hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal\nmodeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies.\nConclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for\nevaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification.

To investigate this, we introduce a\nnovel decomposition of cross-entropy into three parts: Error-Entropy,\nSelf-Alignment, and Confidence. We show both theoretically and empirically that\nthis decomposition precisely captures the training dynamics and optimization\nobjectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and 32 models\nspanning five orders of magnitude in size, we find that only error-entropy\nfollows a robust power-law scaling, while the other two terms remain largely\ninvariant. Moreover, error-entropy constitutes the dominant share of\ncross-entropy in small models but diminishes in proportion as models grow\nlarger. This explains why the cross-entropy scaling law appears accurate at\nsmall scales but fails at very large ones. Our findings establish the\nerror-entropy scaling law as a more accurate description of model behavior. We\nbelieve it will have wide applications in the training, understanding, and\nfuture development of large language models."}

However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may\nlimit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner,\nwhich can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this\npaper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning\nframework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation\nwith the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an\nexisting LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a\nVariational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of\nthought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while\noffering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a\nlatent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens\nwith a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and\niterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows\nefficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the\nmodel to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct\nevaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks.\nEmpirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity,\nand interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent\nreasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent\ndiffusion."}

In this\npaper, we propose a no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metric for\ncontrast-distorted images.

This question is\nessential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D\natomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully\napplied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate\nunderstandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core\nreasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent.\nTo address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on\ntasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure\nrepresentation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF\nperception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current\nmodels, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in\nstructural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these\nmodels make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the\nbasic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in\nsubsequent analysis and materials insights.

At the same time, they are prone to hallucination and\nsycophancy, often providing convincing but flawed proofs for incorrect\nmathematical statements provided by users. This significantly limits the\napplicability of LLMs in theorem proving, as verification of these flawed\nproofs must be done manually by expert mathematicians. However, existing\nbenchmarks that measure sycophancy in mathematics are limited: they focus\nsolely on final-answer problems, rely on very simple and often contaminated\ndatasets, and construct benchmark samples using synthetic modifications that\ncreate ill-posed questions rather than well-posed questions that are\ndemonstrably false. To address these issues, we introduce BrokenMath, the first\nbenchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in LLMs within the context of\nnatural language theorem proving. BrokenMath is built from advanced 2025\ncompetition problems, which are perturbed with an LLM to produce false\nstatements and subsequently refined through expert review. Using an\nLLM-as-a-judge framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and agentic systems\nand find that sycophancy is widespread, with the best model, GPT-5, producing\nsycophantic answers 29% of the time. We further investigate several mitigation\nstrategies, including test-time interventions and supervised fine-tuning on\ncurated sycophantic examples.

By integrating Mamba for\nefficient audio sequence modeling with cross-attention for precise\ntext-acoustic alignment, MAVE enables context-aware voice editing with\nexceptional naturalness and speaker consistency. In pairwise human evaluations\non a random 40-sample subset of the RealEdit benchmark (400 judgments), 57.2%\nof listeners rated MAVE - edited speech as perceptually equal to the original,\nwhile 24.8% prefered the original and 18.0% MAVE - demonstrating that in the\nmajority of cases edits are indistinguishable from the source.

We offer an under-studied perspective by\nexamining how popular MLMs (LLaVA-OneVision, Qwen2.5-VL, and\nLlama-3-LLaVA-NeXT) process their visual key-value tokens. We first study the\nflow of visual information through the language model, finding that image value\ntokens encode sufficient information to perform several perception-heavy tasks\nzero-shot: segmentation, semantic correspondence, temporal correspondence, and\nreferring expression detection. We find that while the language model does\naugment the visual information received from the projection of input visual\nencodings-which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability-it\ncontains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual\nencoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that\nthe visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in\nlater layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception\ncapability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information\nin the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input\nimproves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal\nthat if language models were able to better control their visual information,\ntheir perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style\nquestions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the\nlanguage model is not surfaced to the output!

Secondly, current synthesized methods\ncannot distinguish the distributions of different categories of samples, thus\nproducing ambiguous samples that may lead to an incorrect evaluation by the\nteacher. Besides, current methods cannot optimize the category-wise diversity\nsamples, which will hinder the student model learning from diverse samples and\nfurther achieving better performance. In this paper, to address the above\nlimitations, we propose a novel learning paradigm, i.e., conditional\npseudo-supervised contrast for data-free knowledge distillation~(CPSC-DFKD).\nThe primary innovations of CPSC-DFKD are: (1) introducing a conditional\ngenerative adversarial network to synthesize category-specific diverse images\nfor pseudo-supervised learning, (2) improving the modules of the generator to\ndistinguish the distributions of different categories, and (3) proposing\npseudo-supervised contrastive learning based on teacher and student views to\nenhance diversity. Comprehensive experiments on three commonly-used datasets\nvalidate the performance lift of both the student and generator brought by\nCPSC-DFKD.

Moreover, our approach scales effectively\nacross diverse data sources, including real-world robot data, simulation, and\nhuman egocentric video."}

Two properties are especially desirable: disentanglement,\nwhere changing one attribute does not unintentionally alter others, and\ncontinuous control, where the strength of an edit can be smoothly adjusted. We\nintroduce a method for disentangled and continuous editing through token-level\nmanipulation of text embeddings. The edits are applied by manipulating the\nembeddings along carefully chosen directions, which control the strength of the\ntarget attribute. To identify such directions, we employ a Sparse Autoencoder\n(SAE), whose sparse latent space exposes semantically isolated dimensions. Our\nmethod operates directly on text embeddings without modifying the diffusion\nprocess, making it model agnostic and broadly applicable to various image\nsynthesis backbones. Experiments show that it enables intuitive and efficient\nmanipulations with continuous control across diverse attributes and domains."}

In this paper, we are the first to cast\nthis task as a text-conditioned joint generation, aiming to maintain consistent\non-screen framing while producing two heterogeneous, yet intrinsically linked,\nmodalities: human motion and camera trajectories. We propose a simple,\nmodel-agnostic framework that enforces multimodal coherence via an auxiliary\nmodality: the on-screen framing induced by projecting human joints onto the\ncamera. This on-screen framing provides a natural and effective bridge between\nmodalities, promoting consistency and leading to more precise joint\ndistribution. We first design a joint autoencoder that learns a shared latent\nspace, together with a lightweight linear transform from the human and camera\nlatents to a framing latent. We then introduce auxiliary sampling, which\nexploits this linear transform to steer generation toward a coherent framing\nmodality. To support this task, we also introduce the PulpMotion dataset, a\nhuman-motion and camera-trajectory dataset with rich captions, and high-quality\nhuman motions. Extensive experiments across DiT- and MAR-based architectures\nshow the generality and effectiveness of our method in generating on-frame\ncoherent human-camera motions, while also achieving gains on textual alignment\nfor both modalities. Our qualitative results yield more cinematographically\nmeaningful framings setting the new state of the art for this task.
