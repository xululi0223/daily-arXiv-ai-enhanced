### [1] [FloorPlan-DeepSeek (FPDS): A multimodal approach to floorplan generation using vector-based next room prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21562)
*Jun Yin,Pengyu Zeng,Jing Zhong,Peilin Li,Miao Zhang,Ran Luo,Shuai Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于'下一个房间预测'的渐进式生成方法，用于建筑平面图设计，解决了现有端到端生成模型与真实设计流程不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型多为端到端生成，与建筑设计中渐进迭代的工作流程不兼容，需要一种更符合实际需求的方法。

Method: 受大型语言模型中自回归'下一个标记预测'机制启发，提出了'下一个房间预测'范式，用于建筑平面图建模。

Result: 实验表明，FPDS在文本到平面图任务中表现优于扩散模型和Tell2Design，具有实际应用潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法支持未来智能建筑设计，展示了渐进式生成在建筑领域的适用性。

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is inherently
progressive and iterative. However, existing generative models for floor plans
are predominantly end-to-end generation that produce an entire pixel-based
layout in a single pass. This paradigm is often incompatible with the
incremental workflows observed in real-world architectural practice. To address
this issue, we draw inspiration from the autoregressive 'next token prediction'
mechanism commonly used in large language models, and propose a novel 'next
room prediction' paradigm tailored to architectural floor plan modeling.
Experimental evaluation indicates that FPDS demonstrates competitive
performance in comparison to diffusion models and Tell2Design in the
text-to-floorplan task, indicating its potential applicability in supporting
future intelligent architectural design.

### [2] [Efficient Multilingual ASR Finetuning via LoRA Language Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21555)
*Jiahong Li,Yiwen Shao,Jianheng Zhuo,Chenda Li,Liliang Tang,Dong Yu,Yanmin Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Whisper的LoRA语言专家微调框架，用于定制化多语言ASR，通过专家融合或知识蒸馏提升目标语言识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言ASR中不同语言相互干扰，难以有效共享模型容量，需解决这一问题。

Method: 基于Whisper的LoRA语言专家微调框架，采用专家融合或知识蒸馏。

Result: 在语言感知和无语言感知场景下，性能分别提升约10%和15%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多语言ASR中显著优于标准微调方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced multilingual
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to the development of advanced model
architectures and available large-scale multilingual datasets. Despite that,
multilingual ASR still suffers from the curse of multilinguality in that
different languages tend to interfere with each other, making it difficult for
the ASR model to identify multiple languages effectively while sharing model
capacity across them. This paper proposes an efficient finetuning framework for
customized multilingual ASR via prepared LoRA language experts based on
Whisper. Through LoRA expert fusion or knowledge distillation, our approach
achieves better recognition performance on target languages than standard
fine-tuning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models
yield approximately 10\% and 15\% relative performance gains in language-aware
and language-agnostic scenarios, respectively.

### [3] [VAT-KG: Knowledge-Intensive Multimodal Knowledge Graph Dataset for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21556)
*Hyeongcheol Park,MinHyuk Jang,Ha Dam Baek,Gyusam Chang,Jiyoung Seo,Jiwan Park,Hogun Park,Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型多模态知识图谱VAT-KG，覆盖视觉、音频和文本信息，通过严格过滤和对齐步骤自动生成，并引入多模态RAG框架提升MLLMs的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKGs知识覆盖有限且模态单一，无法满足多模态任务需求，特别是视频和音频等新模态的兴起。

Method: 构建VAT-KG，通过严格过滤和对齐步骤实现跨模态知识对齐，并开发多模态RAG框架支持任意模态查询。

Result: 实验表明VAT-KG在多模态问答任务中有效支持MLLMs，展示了其实际价值。

Conclusion: VAT-KG填补了多模态知识图谱的空白，为MLLMs提供了更全面的知识支持。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which represent explicit knowledge
across multiple modalities, play a pivotal role by complementing the implicit
knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enabling more
grounded reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
MMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting
pre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in
outdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow
range of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations
reduce their extensibility and applicability to a broad range of multimodal
tasks, particularly as the field shifts toward richer modalities such as video
and audio in recent MLLMs. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text
Knowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive
multimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information,
where each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed
descriptions of concepts. Specifically, our construction pipeline ensures
cross-modal knowledge alignment between multimodal data and fine-grained
semantics through a series of stringent filtering and alignment steps, enabling
the automatic generation of MMKGs from any multimodal dataset. We further
introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework that retrieves detailed
concept-level knowledge in response to queries from arbitrary modalities.
Experiments on question answering tasks across various modalities demonstrate
the effectiveness of VAT-KG in supporting MLLMs, highlighting its practical
value in unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge.

### [4] [Debunk and Infer: Multimodal Fake News Detection via Diffusion-Generated Evidence and LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21557)
*Kaiying Yan,Moyang Liu,Yukun Liu,Ruibo Fu,Zhengqi Wen,Jianhua Tao,Xuefei Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合生成扩散模型和多模态大语言模型的假新闻检测框架DIFND，通过生成反驳证据和多代理推理提升检测性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假新闻在多媒体平台上的快速传播对信息可信度构成严重挑战，需要更高效且可解释的检测方法。

Method: DIFND结合条件扩散模型生成反驳证据，利用多模态大语言模型进行多代理推理，形成逻辑基础的多模态感知验证。

Result: 在FakeSV和FVC数据集上，DIFND检测准确率显著优于现有方法，并提供可信决策。

Conclusion: DIFND通过联合建模多模态特征、生成反驳线索和推理验证，实现了高效且可解释的假新闻检测。

Abstract: The rapid spread of fake news across multimedia platforms presents serious
challenges to information credibility. In this paper, we propose a
Debunk-and-Infer framework for Fake News Detection(DIFND) that leverages
debunking knowledge to enhance both the performance and interpretability of
fake news detection. DIFND integrates the generative strength of conditional
diffusion models with the collaborative reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, debunk diffusion is employed to
generate refuting or authenticating evidence based on the multimodal content of
news videos, enriching the evaluation process with diverse yet semantically
aligned synthetic samples. To improve inference, we propose a chain-of-debunk
strategy where a multi-agent MLLM system produces logic-grounded,
multimodal-aware reasoning content and final veracity judgment. By jointly
modeling multimodal features, generative debunking cues, and reasoning-rich
verification within a unified architecture, DIFND achieves notable improvements
in detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the FakeSV and FVC datasets
show that DIFND not only outperforms existing approaches but also delivers
trustworthy decisions.

### [5] [Bench to the Future: A Pastcasting Benchmark for Forecasting Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21558)
*FutureSearch,:,Jack Wildman,Nikos I. Bosse,Daniel Hnyk,Peter Mühlbacher,Finn Hambly,Jon Evans,Dan Schwarz,Lawrence Phillips*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为BTF的“过去预测”基准测试，用于评估LLM在已知结果事件上的预测能力，提供了一种现实且可重复的环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于预测任务需要大量互联网研究和时间验证，现有基准测试难以满足需求，因此开发了BTF以填补这一空白。

Method: BTF包含数百个已知结果的高质量问题和相关网页离线语料库，用于模拟LLM对过去事件的预测。

Result: 实验表明，BTF能产生与未解决事件预测相似的结果，并成功测试了多种LLM的预测能力。

Conclusion: BTF是一个动态基准测试，将持续更新问题以跟踪LLM预测能力的进步，并欢迎研究者使用。

Abstract: Forecasting is a challenging task that offers a clearly measurable way to
study AI systems. Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the
internet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the
development of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting
benchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM
forecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a "pastcasting" benchmark
with hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already
known. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of
thousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic "forecasts"
on past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can
produce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on
at-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and
chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the
recently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track
steady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living
benchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing
training data cutoff dates. We invite researchers to contact us at
hello@futuresearch.ai to utilize our benchmark or tooling for their own
research.

### [6] [GraphLAMA: Enabling Efficient Adaptation of Graph Language Models with Limited Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21559)
*Junze Chen,Cheng Yang,Shujie Li,Zhiqiang Zhang,Yawen Li,Junping Du,Chuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出GraphLAMA方法，通过参数适应阶段优化图语言模型（GLM），解决上下文学习（ICL）和指令调优的局限性，实现更高准确性和更快推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图语言模型（GLM）在上下文学习（ICL）和指令调优中存在效率和效果问题，需要大量标注数据或面临固定参数限制。

Method: 提出GraphLAMA方法，结合图神经网络（GNN）和语言模型，通过预训练和参数适应阶段，实现高效调优和推理。

Result: 实验表明，GraphLAMA在少样本/零样本任务中性能最优，准确率提升4.91%，推理速度比ICL快10倍。

Conclusion: GraphLAMA通过参数适应阶段显著提升了GLM的性能和效率，适用于实际场景中的少样本学习。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong capabilities in
various domains, and have been recently integrated for graph analysis as graph
language models (GLMs). With LLMs as the predictor, some GLMs can interpret
unseen tasks described by natural language, and learn from a few examples in
the prompts without parameter tuning, known as in-context learning (ICL).
Another subset of GLMs utilizes abundant training labels to enhance model
performance, known as instruction tuning. However, we argue that ICL on graphs
has effectiveness issues due to fixed parameters and efficiency issues due to
long context. Meanwhile, the large amount of labeled data required for
instruction tuning can be difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To this
end, we aim to introduce an extra parameter adaptation stage that can
efficiently tailor GLMs to an unseen graph and task with only a few labeled
examples, in exchange for better prediction accuracy and faster inference
speed. For implementation, in this paper we propose GraphLAMA method, with its
model backbone and learning schemes specialized for efficient tuning and
inference. Specifically, for model backbone, we use a graph neural network
(GNN) with several well-designed components to transform nodes into the
representation space of LLM tokens. Task instructions can then be represented
as a mixture of node and language tokens. In the pre-training stage, model
parameters except the LLM will be trained with different tasks to capture
general knowledge. In the adaptation stage, only a few pre-trained parameters
will be updated based on few-shot examples. Extensive experiments on
few/zero-shot node classification and summary generation show that our proposed
GraphLAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with 4.91% absolution
improvement in accuracy. Compared with ICL, our inference speed can be 10 times
faster under 5-shot setting.

### [7] [Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning of Language Model for Instruction Following and Math Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21560)
*Yifu Han,Geo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了强化学习微调技术在小型语言模型上的效果，比较了SFT、DPO和RLOO方法，发现RLOO表现最佳，DPO稳定，数学任务中数据增强和验证器显著提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过强化学习微调技术提升小型语言模型在指令跟随和数学推理任务中的表现。

Method: 比较了监督微调（SFT）、直接偏好优化（DPO）和强化留一法（RLOO），并测试了数据增强和外部验证器的作用。

Result: RLOO结合DeBERTa奖励模型表现最佳，DPO结果稳定；数学任务中数据增强和验证器显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为小型语言模型的训练提供了实用策略，展示了微调与推理工具结合的优势。

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning techniques on a compact language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B Base) for two
challenging tasks: instruction following and mathematical reasoning. We compare
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
preference-labeled data, and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) with reward models.
Our experiments show that RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieves the best
alignment, while DPO provides strong and consistent results. For math reasoing
tasks, synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external
verifier significantly improve accuracy, showing the potential of combining
fine-tuning with inference-time tools. This study highlights key trade-offs and
practical strategies for training lightweight, task-aligned small-scale
language models.

### [8] [Reasoning Isn't Enough: Examining Truth-Bias and Sycophancy in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21561)
*Emilio Barkett,Olivia Long,Madhavendra Thakur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在真相检测中的表现，发现推理模型比非推理模型更少偏见，但仍高于人类基准。部分先进模型存在迎合倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs广泛应用于事实核查和决策，但其真相判断能力仍不明确，需系统性评估。

Method: 让8个LLMs进行4,800次真相判断，比较推理与非推理模型的表现。

Result: 推理模型的真相偏见较低，但部分先进模型在欺骗检测上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 能力提升未能解决LLMs在真相检测中的根本挑战。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use in fact-checking, moderation, and high-stakes
decision-making, large language models (LLMs) remain poorly understood as
judges of truth. This study presents the largest evaluation to date of LLMs'
veracity detection capabilities and the first analysis of these capabilities in
reasoning models. We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across
several prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that
rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true,
regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than
in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most
concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models
(o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an
asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly
in deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not
resolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.

### [9] [FormosanBench: Benchmarking Low-Resource Austronesian Languages in the Era of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21563)
*Kaiying Kevin Lin,Hsiyu Chen,Haopeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FORMOSANBENCH是首个评估大语言模型在低资源南岛语系语言（如阿美语、泰雅语和排湾语）表现的基准测试，结果显示现有模型表现不佳，强调了支持濒危语言的紧迫性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在低资源和濒危语言（如台湾南岛语系语言）中的性能，填补研究空白。

Method: 引入FORMOSANBENCH基准，评估模型在机器翻译、自动语音识别和文本摘要任务中的零样本、10样本和微调表现。

Result: 现有模型在低资源语言中表现显著落后，10样本学习和微调改进有限。

Conclusion: 亟需开发更具包容性的NLP技术以支持濒危语言，并公开数据集和代码促进研究。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks in high-resource
languages, their capabilities in low-resource and minority languages remain
significantly underexplored. Formosan languages -- a subgroup of Austronesian
languages spoken in Taiwan -- are both linguistically rich and endangered,
largely due to the sociolinguistic dominance of Mandarin. In this work, we
introduce FORMOSANBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
low-resource Austronesian languages. It covers three endangered Formosan
languages: Atayal, Amis, and Paiwan, across three core NLP tasks: machine
translation, automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text summarization. We
assess model performance in zero-shot, 10-shot, and fine-tuned settings using
FORMOSANBENCH. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap between
high-resource and Formosan languages. Existing LLMs consistently underperform
across all tasks, with 10-shot learning and fine-tuning offering only limited
improvements. These findings underscore the urgent need for more inclusive NLP
technologies that can effectively support endangered and underrepresented
languages. We release our datasets and code to facilitate future research in
this direction.

### [11] [A Multi-Agent Probabilistic Inference Framework Inspired by Kairanban-Style CoT System with IdoBata Conversation for Debiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21565)
*Takato Ueno,Keito Inoshita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究受日本传统沟通文化启发，提出了一种多代理推理框架（KCS+IBC），结合大型语言模型（LLM）以减少偏见、提高可解释性并实现概率预测。实验表明，该框架在保持准确性的同时，能够平衡预测的聚合与多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受日本传统沟通文化（如回覧板和井端会话）启发，研究旨在通过多代理推理框架改善情感分析中的偏见问题和可解释性。

Method: 提出KCS+IBC框架，结合多个LLM，通过中间阶段的非正式对话整合个体观点，并引入概率情感预测。

Result: KCS与单一LLM准确性相当，KCS+IBC在推理后期熵降低、方差增加，表明框架能平衡预测的聚合与多样性。

Conclusion: 未来工作将量化评估该框架对偏见修正的影响，并开发更先进的情感分析系统。

Abstract: Japan's kairanban culture and idobata conversations have long functioned as
traditional communication practices that foster nuanced dialogue among
community members and contribute to the formation of social balance. Inspired
by these information exchange processes, this study proposes a multi-agent
inference framework (KCS+IBC) that integrates multiple large language models
(LLMs) to achieve bias mitigation, improved explainability, and probabilistic
prediction in sentiment analysis. In addition to sequentially sharing
prediction results, the proposed method incorporates a mid-phase casual
dialogue session to blend formal inference with individual perspectives and
introduces probabilistic sentiment prediction. Experimental results show that
KCS achieves accuracy comparable to that of a single LLM across datasets, while
KCS+IBC exhibits a consistent decrease in entropy and a gradual increase in
variance during the latter stages of inference, suggesting the framework's
ability to balance aggregation and diversity of predictions. Future work will
quantitatively assess the impact of these characteristics on bias correction
and aim to develop more advanced sentiment analysis systems.

### [12] [The Saturation Point of Backtranslation in High Quality Low Resource English Gujarati Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21566)
*Arwa Arif*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了反向翻译（BT）在英语-古吉拉特语低资源机器翻译中的效果，发现合成数据并未提升性能，甚至略有下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索反向翻译在高质量低资源机器翻译中的有效性，尤其是在英语-古吉拉特语翻译中。

Method: 使用MBART50模型，基于5万句高质量平行语料库训练基线系统，并加入反向翻译生成的合成数据。

Result: 反向翻译数据未提升翻译性能，某些情况下略有下降。

Conclusion: 反向翻译在特定低资源场景中可能收益递减，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Backtranslation BT is widely used in low resource machine translation MT to
generate additional synthetic training data using monolingual corpora. While
this approach has shown strong improvements for many language pairs, its
effectiveness in high quality, low resource settings remains unclear. In this
work, we explore the effectiveness of backtranslation for English Gujarati
translation using the multilingual pretrained MBART50 model. Our baseline
system, trained on a high quality parallel corpus of approximately 50,000
sentence pairs, achieves a BLEU score of 43.8 on a validation set. We augment
this data with carefully filtered backtranslated examples generated from
monolingual Gujarati text. Surprisingly, adding this synthetic data does not
improve translation performance and, in some cases, slightly reduces it. We
evaluate our models using multiple metrics like BLEU, ChrF++, TER, BLEURT and
analyze possible reasons for this saturation. Our findings suggest that
backtranslation may reach a point of diminishing returns in certain
low-resource settings and we discuss implications for future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了BioPars，一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在生物信息学任务中能力的工具，并展示了其在波斯医学问答中的首次应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估LLMs在生物信息学中的能力，特别是在波斯医学问答中的表现，并填补这一领域的空白。

Method: 方法包括构建BIOPARS-BENCH数据集和BioParsQA评估工具，并比较ChatGPT、Llama和Galactica在知识获取、解释和推理方面的能力。

Result: BioPars在多个评估指标上表现优异，如ROUGE-L（29.99）、BERTScore（90.87）、MoverScore（60.43）和BLEURT（50.78），优于GPT-4 1.0。

Conclusion: 结论指出LLMs在生物信息学任务中仍有改进空间，BioPars为波斯医学问答提供了有效工具，未来将继续优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention in the life
sciences due to their capacity to model, extract, and apply complex biological
information. Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are
increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized
fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset
from over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites.
BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of
5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces
BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main
abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing
such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama,
and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve
learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level,
real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the
need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in
bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM
in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of
four selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable
results compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a
ROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model
achieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT
values were also higher in this model than the other three models. In addition,
the reported scores for the model are MoverScore=60.43 and BLEURT=50.78.
BioPars is an ongoing project and all resources related to its development will
be made available via the following GitHub repository:

TL;DR: 研究评估了RAG和HyDE两种增强策略在小型Gemma LLM上的效果，发现RAG在延迟和准确性上表现更优，适合隐私优先的个人助手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在边缘和隐私敏感应用中部署大型语言模型的资源效率问题。

Method: 使用MongoDB和Qdrant实现短/长期记忆，通过FastAPI和LangChain协调，React.js前端展示。

Result: RAG减少延迟17%，消除幻觉；HyDE提升语义相关性但增加延迟和幻觉率。

Conclusion: RAG是小型LLM驱动的个人助手的实用选择。

Abstract: Resource efficiency is a critical barrier to deploying large language models
(LLMs) in edge and privacy-sensitive applications. This study evaluates the
efficacy of two augmentation strategies--Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)--on compact Gemma LLMs of 1 billion
and 4 billion parameters, within the context of a privacy-first personal
assistant. We implement short-term memory via MongoDB and long-term semantic
storage via Qdrant, orchestrated through FastAPI and LangChain, and expose the
system through a React.js frontend. Across both model scales, RAG consistently
reduces latency by up to 17\% and eliminates factual hallucinations when
responding to user-specific and domain-specific queries. HyDE, by contrast,
enhances semantic relevance--particularly for complex physics prompts--but
incurs a 25--40\% increase in response time and a non-negligible hallucination
rate in personal-data retrieval. Comparing 1 B to 4 B models, we observe that
scaling yields marginal throughput gains for baseline and RAG pipelines, but
magnifies HyDE's computational overhead and variability. Our findings position
RAG as the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants powered by
small-scale LLMs.

Motivation: 手动编写SystemVerilog断言（SVAs）是一项耗时且易错的任务，而现有大型语言模型（LLMs）在理解领域特定语法和语义方面仍有不足。因此，需要一种方法来自动化并优化这一翻译过程。

Method: 提出了一种定制化的RAG框架和合成微调数据集，通过提供提示引导的解释来指导LLMs逐步构建并发SVAs，从而提升语法和功能准确性。

Result: 实验结果显示，定制化的RAG框架使功能匹配SVAs数量增加了58.42%，而微调后的Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct模型结合HybridRetrieval实现了59.05%的提升。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了LLM在NL2SVA任务中的性能，为硬件设计验证提供了更高效的自动化工具。

Abstract: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) are critical for verifying the correctness of
hardware designs, but manually writing them from natural language property
descriptions, i.e., NL2SVA, remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate
this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding
domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we
propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a
synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To
further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset
provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer
construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that
greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance
of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA,
comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed
annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework
increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini,
while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and
integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.

Motivation: 研究预训练语言模型在时间序列预测中的有效迁移，以优化低数据量下的计算效率。

Result: 验证损失持续下降，且存在非零迁移差距，设计选择对性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究为高效计算训练提供了指导，并开启了跨模态数据分布特性的研究。

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of adapting pre-trained
language models (LMs) for forecasting time series in the low-data regime. We
build upon these findings by analyzing the effective transfer from language
models to time series forecasting under various design choices including
upstream post-training, time series tokenizer and language backbone size. In
the low-data regime, these design choices have a significant impact on the
validation loss, with clear-cut choices that outperform others. Contrary to
Hernandez et al. (2021), we observe that the validation loss of the LMs
continues to smoothly decrease long after the validation loss of the randomly
initialized models has converged, leading to a non-vanishing transfer gap that
holds across design choices. These findings not only help shed light on the
effective use of compute-efficient training for time series, but also open the
way for the study of modality-agnostic properties of data distributions
leveraged by these models.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型推理模型（LRMs）是否表现出类似人类的认知习惯，并提出了CogTest基准来评估这些习惯。研究发现LRMs具有适应性的人类认知习惯，且某些习惯与安全任务中的有害响应相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索LRMs是否表现出类似人类的认知习惯，以及这些习惯如何影响模型行为。

Method: 通过CogTest基准评估16种认知习惯，每种习惯包含25个任务，采用证据优先的提取方法。

Result: LRMs表现出类似人类的认知习惯，并能够根据不同任务适应性调整。某些习惯（如“承担负责任的风险”）与有害响应相关。

Conclusion: 研究LRMs的认知习惯有助于深入理解模型行为，特别是其潜在的有害行为。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which autonomously produce a reasoning Chain
of Thought (CoT) before producing final responses, offer a promising approach
to interpreting and monitoring model behaviors. Inspired by the observation
that certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' --
consistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like
cognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of
cognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce
CogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits.
CogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks,
and employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit
identification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16
widely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that
LRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also
adaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses
further uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit
profiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and
DeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that
certain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with
the generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying
persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper
understanding of LLM misbehavior. The code is available at:

Conclusion: 提出的框架为MLLM评估提供了更结构化、理论化的基准设计方法，提升了评估的准确性和诊断能力。

Abstract: Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains a fundamental
challenge due to a lack of structured, interpretable, and theoretically
grounded benchmark designs. Existing benchmarks often adopt heuristic-based
task groupings with unclear cognitive targets, thus resulting in overlapping
abilities, redundant indicators, and limited diagnostic power. In this work, we
propose a novel framework for aligning MLLM benchmark based on Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze and quantify the internal validity,
dimensional separability, and contribution of benchmark components. Motivated
by the observed limitations of current designs, we further introduce a novel
capability hierarchy grounded in Piagets theory of cognitive development,
dividing MLLM abilities into three hierarchical layers, i.e., Perception,
Memory, and Reasoning. We reorganize existing MLLM benchmarks under the
proposed framework and construct a new benchmark named Gold. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark exhibits stronger
interpretability, reduced indicator redundancy, and clearer cognitive
consistency compared to existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黑盒模型成本高和白盒模型计算资源需求大、表征能力有限的问题。

Method: 融合黑盒模型的高质量指令初始化和白盒模型的细粒度可解释性，通过语义相似性约束生成统一高维表示。

Result: 在复杂推理和跨语言泛化等任务中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代大语言模型应用提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing instructions for large language models (LLMs) is critical for
harnessing their full potential in complex and diverse tasks. However, relying
solely on white-box approaches demands extensive computational resources and
offers limited representational capacity, while black-box models can incur
prohibitive financial costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
framework that seamlessly merges the strengths of both paradigms. Black-box
models provide high-quality, diverse instruction initializations, and white-box
models supply fine-grained interpretability through hidden states and output
features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse
into a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and
structural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine
instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad
spectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual
generalization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with
advanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving
the way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released soon.

Result: LLM能模拟人类决策策略，注重效用最大化和程序公平，但仍存在国籍偏见和特权群体偏好。

Conclusion: LLM在移民决策自动化中具有潜力，但需解决偏见问题。

Abstract: With globalization and increasing immigrant populations, immigration
departments face significant work-loads and the challenge of ensuring fairness
in decision-making processes. Integrating artificial intelligence offers a
promising solution to these challenges. This study investigates the potential
of large language models (LLMs),such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in supporting
immigration decision-making. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach,this paper
conducted discrete choice experiments and in-depth interviews to study LLM
decision-making strategies and whether they are fair. Our findings demonstrate
that LLMs can align their decision-making with human strategies, emphasizing
utility maximization and procedural fairness. Meanwhile, this paper also
reveals that while ChatGPT has safeguards to prevent unintentional
discrimination, it still exhibits stereotypes and biases concerning nationality
and shows preferences toward privileged group. This dual analysis highlights
both the potential and limitations of LLMs in automating and enhancing
immigration decisions.

TL;DR: STRuCT-LLM是一个统一框架，通过强化学习和Chain-of-Thought监督联合优化Text-to-SQL和Text-to-Cypher任务，实现跨形式迁移，显著提升语义解析和知识图谱问答性能。

Motivation: 解决现有方法在处理关系型和图结构数据时孤立对待的问题，利用SQL和Cypher的共享抽象实现跨形式迁移。

Method: 结合强化学习和Chain-of-Thought监督，引入基于图编辑距离的拓扑感知奖励函数，联合优化Text-to-SQL和Text-to-Cypher任务。

Result: QwQ-32B模型在Spider任务上提升13.5%，Text2Cypher提升73.1%，并在零样本下游任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: STRuCT-LLM证明了可执行查询作为结构化推理支架的有效性，以及联合训练SQL和Cypher的协同优势。

Abstract: We propose STRuCT-LLM, a unified framework for training large language models
(LLMs) to perform structured reasoning over both relational and
graph-structured data. Our approach jointly optimizes Text-to-SQL and
Text-to-Cypher tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. To support fine-grained optimization in
graph-based parsing, we introduce a topology-aware reward function based on
graph edit distance. Unlike prior work that treats relational and graph
formalisms in isolation, STRuCT-LLM leverages shared abstractions between SQL
and Cypher to induce cross-formalism transfer, enabling SQL training to improve
Cypher performance and vice versa - even without shared schemas. Our largest
model (QwQ-32B) achieves substantial relative improvements across tasks: on
semantic parsing, Spider improves by 13.5\% and Text2Cypher by 73.1\%. The
model also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance
on downstream tabular QA (TableBench: 8.5\%) and knowledge graph QA
(CR-LT-KGQA: 1.7\%) without any QA-specific supervision. These results
demonstrate both the effectiveness of executable queries as scaffolds for
structured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL
and Cypher (code available at https://github.com/bouv/STRuCT-LLM).

TL;DR: 论文探讨了Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT)在低资源场景下提升多语言ASR模型性能的方法，特别是针对代码切换（CS）任务。通过两种策略（全微调和仅训练软提示）及SPT4ASR方法，实验表明深度提示调优效果最佳，且能保持参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模多语言ASR模型在低资源场景（如稀有语言和代码切换）中的性能问题，避免计算成本高和灾难性遗忘。

Method: 采用Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT)方法，评估全微调（FFT）和仅训练软提示两种策略，并提出SPT4ASR组合方法。

Result: 在SEAME和ASRU2019数据集上，深度提示调优效果最佳，SPT4ASR进一步降低了CS ASR的错误率，同时保持参数效率。

Conclusion: SPT方法能有效提升低资源场景下的ASR性能，尤其是代码切换任务，且不损害现有语言的性能。

Abstract: Large-scale multilingual ASR models like Whisper excel in high-resource
settings but face challenges in low-resource scenarios, such as rare languages
and code-switching (CS), due to computational costs and catastrophic
forgetting. We explore Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT), a parameter-efficient method
to enhance CS ASR while preserving prior knowledge. We evaluate two strategies:
(1) full fine-tuning (FFT) of both soft prompts and the entire Whisper model,
demonstrating improved cross-lingual capabilities compared to traditional
methods, and (2) adhering to SPT's original design by freezing model parameters
and only training soft prompts. Additionally, we introduce SPT4ASR, a
combination of different SPT variants. Experiments on the SEAME and ASRU2019
datasets show that deep prompt tuning is the most effective SPT approach, and
our SPT4ASR methods achieve further error reductions in CS ASR, maintaining
parameter efficiency similar to LoRA, without degrading performance on existing
languages.

Conclusion: 提出的方法为动态多语言ASR模型提供了高效解决方案，计算开销小。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) have
been driven by large-scale end-to-end models like Whisper. However, challenges
such as language interference and expanding to unseen languages (language
expansion) without degrading performance persist. This paper addresses these
with three contributions: 1) Entire Soft Prompt Tuning (Entire SPT), which
applies soft prompts to both the encoder and decoder, enhancing feature
extraction and decoding; 2) Language-Aware Prompt Tuning (LAPT), which
leverages cross-lingual similarities to encode shared and language-specific
features using lightweight prompt matrices; 3) SPT-Whisper, a toolkit that
integrates SPT into Whisper and enables efficient continual learning.
Experiments across three languages from FLEURS demonstrate that Entire SPT and
LAPT outperform Decoder SPT by 5.0% and 16.0% in language expansion tasks,
respectively, providing an efficient solution for dynamic, multilingual ASR
models with minimal computational overhead.

TL;DR: HealthQA-BR是首个针对葡萄牙语医疗的大规模基准测试，覆盖多专业领域，揭示了LLMs在医疗中的知识不均衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估过于医生中心和英语主导，忽略了医疗的跨专业特性，需更全面的评估工具。

Method: 基于巴西国家考试构建5,632个问题的基准，对20多个LLM进行零样本评估。

Result: GPT 4.1总体准确率86.6%，但不同专业表现差异大（眼科98.7%，社会工作68.4%）。

Conclusion: 单一评分不足，需更细粒度评估，HealthQA-BR为医疗AI安全性验证提供工具。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare has been
dominated by physician-centric, English-language benchmarks, creating a
dangerous illusion of competence that ignores the interprofessional nature of
patient care. To provide a more holistic and realistic assessment, we introduce
HealthQA-BR, the first large-scale, system-wide benchmark for
Portuguese-speaking healthcare. Comprising 5,632 questions from Brazil's
national licensing and residency exams, it uniquely assesses knowledge not only
in medicine and its specialties but also in nursing, dentistry, psychology,
social work, and other allied health professions. We conducted a rigorous
zero-shot evaluation of over 20 leading LLMs. Our results reveal that while
state-of-the-art models like GPT 4.1 achieve high overall accuracy (86.6%),
this top-line score masks alarming, previously unmeasured deficiencies. A
granular analysis shows performance plummets from near-perfect in specialties
like Ophthalmology (98.7%) to barely passing in Neurosurgery (60.0%) and, most
notably, Social Work (68.4%). This "spiky" knowledge profile is a systemic
issue observed across all models, demonstrating that high-level scores are
insufficient for safety validation. By publicly releasing HealthQA-BR and our
evaluation suite, we provide a crucial tool to move beyond single-score
evaluations and toward a more honest, granular audit of AI readiness for the
entire healthcare team.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in various domains. However, effective decision-making
relies heavily on strong reasoning abilities. Reasoning is the foundation for
decision-making, providing the analytical and logical framework to make sound
choices. Reasoning involves analyzing information, drawing inferences, and
reaching conclusions based on logic or evidence. Decision-making builds on this
foundation by applying the insights from reasoning to select the best course of
action among alternatives. Together, these processes create a continuous cycle
of thought and action aimed at achieving goals effectively. As AI technology
evolves, there is a growing trend to train LLMs to excel in general reasoning.
This study explores how the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs connect to
their performance in domain-specific reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for
entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text
analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.).
We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct
advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a
human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1)
Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search
algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution,
which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation,
which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user
validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to
evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study
involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience
-- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals
distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for
human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for
non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics
systems.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注高资源语言和标准化脚本，忽视了非正式和低资源语言（如罗马乌尔都语），本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入多类别标注数据集，分析希望言论的语言模式，并提出基于注意力的Transformer模型（XLM-R），通过5折交叉验证评估。

Result: XLM-R模型表现最佳（0.78分），优于SVM（0.75）和BiLSTM（0.76），性能提升显著。

Conclusion: 本研究为低资源语言中的希望言论检测提供了新方法和数据集，验证了XLM-R模型的优越性。

Abstract: Hope is a positive emotional state involving the expectation of favorable
future outcomes, while hope speech refers to communication that promotes
optimism, resilience, and support, particularly in adverse contexts. Although
hope speech detection has gained attention in Natural Language Processing
(NLP), existing research mainly focuses on high-resource languages and
standardized scripts, often overlooking informal and underrepresented forms
such as Roman Urdu. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
address hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu by introducing a
carefully annotated dataset, thereby filling a critical gap in inclusive NLP
research for low-resource, informal language varieties. This study makes four
key contributions: (1) it introduces the first multi-class annotated dataset
for Roman Urdu hope speech, comprising Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope,
Unrealistic Hope, and Not Hope categories; (2) it explores the psychological
foundations of hope and analyzes its linguistic patterns in code-mixed Roman
Urdu to inform dataset development; (3) it proposes a custom attention-based
transformer model optimized for the syntactic and semantic variability of Roman
Urdu, evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation; and (4) it verifies the
statistical significance of performance gains using a t-test. The proposed
model, XLM-R, achieves the best performance with a cross-validation score of
0.78, outperforming the baseline SVM (0.75) and BiLSTM (0.76), with gains of 4%
and 2.63% respectively.

Method: 使用LLaMA 3 8B模型，通过提示干预（如道义框架和推理提示）观察对齐伪装行为的变化。

Result: 提示干预显著减少了对齐伪装行为，表明该行为不仅限于大规模模型。

Conclusion: 研究强调了对齐评估需涵盖不同规模模型和部署环境，并提出了浅层与深层伪装行为的分类。

Abstract: Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an
emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical
evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can
also exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions,
including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly
reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the
assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment
requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception,
shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception,
which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the
understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for
alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.

Conclusion: 间接提取方法为基于模板网页的大规模信息提取提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential
for automating the extraction of structured information from web pages. In this
work, we focus on food product pages from online retailers and explore
schema-constrained extraction approaches to retrieve key product attributes,
such as ingredient lists and nutrition tables. We compare two LLM-based
approaches, direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions,
evaluating them in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost on a curated dataset
of 3,000 food product pages from three different online shops. Our results show
that although the indirect approach achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48\%,
$-1.61\%$ compared to direct extraction), it reduces the number of required LLM
calls by 95.82\%, leading to substantial efficiency gains and lower operational
costs. These findings suggest that indirect extraction approaches can provide
scalable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale information extraction
tasks from template-based web pages using LLMs.

Motivation: 研究哑剧动作（NVC子集）是理解更复杂非语言交流的基础，但现有模型对此能力不足。

Method: 构建了MIME基准，包含86种哑剧动作，通过动作捕捉数据生成，并加入干扰因素评估模型鲁棒性。

Result: 现有视觉语言模型在MIME上的表现显著低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 需加强研究以提升模型对人类手势的理解能力。

Abstract: Nonverbal communication (NVC) plays an integral role in human language, but
studying NVC in general is challenging because of its broad scope and high
variance in interpretation among individuals and cultures. However, mime -- the
theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and
movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions
with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid
understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language
models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC.
Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel
video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions.
Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each
action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint
for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and
API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on
MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust
understanding of human gestures.

### [31] [Is DeepSeek a New Voice Among LLMs in Public Opinion Simulation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21587)
*Weihong Qi,Fan Huang,Jisun An,Haewoon Kwak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepSeek-V3在模拟美国和中国公众意见时表现最佳，尤其是在特定议题上，但也存在文化和社会经济偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估开源大模型DeepSeek在模拟公众意见方面的能力，并与主流科技公司的模型进行比较。

Method: 比较DeepSeek-R1和DeepSeek-V3与Qwen2.5、GPT-4o、Llama-3.3，利用中美调查数据评估模型预测能力。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在模拟美国堕胎议题和中国对外援助议题上表现最佳，但在某些议题上存在偏见和局限性。

Conclusion: 需减少LLM在公众意见模拟中的文化和人口偏见，建议采用更包容的训练方法。

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of DeepSeek, an open-source large language
model (LLM), to simulate public opinions in comparison to LLMs developed by
major tech companies. By comparing DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5,
GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 and utilizing survey data from the American National
Election Studies (ANES) and the Zuobiao dataset of China, we assess these
models' capacity to predict public opinions on social issues in both China and
the United States, highlighting their comparative capabilities between
countries. Our findings indicate that DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
U.S. opinions on the abortion issue compared to other topics such as climate
change, gun control, immigration, and services for same-sex couples, primarily
because it more accurately simulates responses when provided with Democratic or
liberal personas. For Chinese samples, DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
opinions on foreign aid and individualism but shows limitations in modeling
views on capitalism, particularly failing to capture the stances of low-income
and non-college-educated individuals. It does not exhibit significant
differences from other models in simulating opinions on traditionalism and the
free market. Further analysis reveals that all LLMs exhibit the tendency to
overgeneralize a single perspective within demographic groups, often defaulting
to consistent responses within groups. These findings highlight the need to
mitigate cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven public opinion modeling,
calling for approaches such as more inclusive training methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs中记忆化的具体机制，包括记忆化序列的启动点和模型在记忆化与非记忆化内容生成时的行为差异。

Method: 利用变压器电路（最小计算子图）和对比数据集，分析模型生成与记忆化内容的分歧点，并分离记忆化的特定电路。

Result: 发现启动记忆化的电路也能维持记忆化，而仅维持记忆化的电路无法触发启动；记忆化预防机制在不同领域具有鲁棒性，而记忆化启动更依赖上下文。

Conclusion: 记忆化的启动和维持由不同电路控制，预防机制具有跨领域通用性，而启动机制更受上下文影响。

Abstract: Underlying mechanisms of memorization in LLMs -- the verbatim reproduction of
training data -- remain poorly understood. What exact part of the network
decides to retrieve a token that we would consider as start of memorization
sequence? How exactly is the models' behaviour different when producing
memorized sentence vs non-memorized? In this work we approach these questions
from mechanistic interpretability standpoint by utilizing transformer circuits
-- the minimal computational subgraphs that perform specific functions within
the model. Through carefully constructed contrastive datasets, we identify
points where model generation diverges from memorized content and isolate the
specific circuits responsible for two distinct aspects of memorization. We find
that circuits that initiate memorization can also maintain it once started,
while circuits that only maintain memorization cannot trigger its initiation.
Intriguingly, memorization prevention mechanisms transfer robustly across
different text domains, while memorization induction appears more
context-dependent.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用LLM检测器（GLD），通过双记忆网络设计和理论指导的检测泛化模块，解决了现有方法在新LLM和未知领域检测中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）的普及，区分人类撰写和LLM生成内容变得困难，这对数字平台的信任和防止错误信息传播至关重要。现有检测方法在泛化到新LLM和未知领域时效果有限。

Method: GLD结合了双记忆网络设计和理论指导的检测泛化模块，以检测未知LLM和领域的生成内容。

Result: 通过真实数据集评估，GLD在检测性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GLD为数字平台和LLM提供了重要的学术和实践价值。

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
transformed the digital information landscape, making it increasingly
challenging to distinguish between human-written and LLM-generated content.
Detecting LLM-generated information is essential for preserving trust on
digital platforms (e.g., social media and e-commerce sites) and preventing the
spread of misinformation, a topic that has garnered significant attention in IS
research. However, current detection methods, which primarily focus on
identifying content generated by specific LLMs in known domains, face
challenges in generalizing to new (i.e., unseen) LLMs and domains. This
limitation reduces their effectiveness in real-world applications, where the
number of LLMs is rapidly multiplying and content spans a vast array of
domains. In response, we introduce a general LLM detector (GLD) that combines a
twin memory networks design and a theory-guided detection generalization module
to detect LLM-generated information across unseen LLMs and domains. Using
real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations and case
studies to demonstrate the superiority of GLD over state-of-the-art detection
methods. The study has important academic and practical implications for
digital platforms and LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为表示一致性（RC）的测试时扩展方法，通过聚合LLM生成的多个候选答案并考虑内部激活的一致性，提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要复杂的提示和采样策略修改，RC旨在通过轻量级方法提升推理性能。

Method: RC通过分析模型生成多个候选答案时的内部激活一致性（密集或稀疏）来加权聚合答案。

Result: 在四个开源LLM和四个推理数据集上验证，RC显著提升任务性能（最高4%）。

Conclusion: RC是一种高效且无需额外模型查询的方法，稀疏激活信号与连贯推理概念一致。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves large language models' (LLMs) performance by
allocating more compute budget during inference. To achieve this, existing
methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling
strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a
test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate
responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations
in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not
only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate
response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations
while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations
can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained
sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of
multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this
answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be
down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached
activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional
model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four
reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task
performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)
over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the
sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent
reasoning.

Method: 引入FinEval-KR框架，提出知识和推理评分，基于Bloom分类法设计认知评分，并发布开源中文金融推理数据集。

Result: 实验显示LLMs的推理和高阶认知能力是准确性的核心因素，知识应用仍是瓶颈，专业金融LLMs表现落后于通用大模型。

Conclusion: FinEval-KR为金融推理能力评估提供了新工具，揭示了LLMs在金融领域的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential but face
challenges in complex financial reasoning tasks requiring both domain knowledge
and sophisticated reasoning. Current evaluation benchmarks often fall short by
not decoupling these capabilities indicators from single task performance and
lack root cause analysis for task failure. To address this, we introduce
FinEval-KR, a novel evaluation framework for decoupling and quantifying LLMs'
knowledge and reasoning abilities independently, proposing distinct knowledge
score and reasoning score metrics. Inspired by cognitive science, we further
propose a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy to analyze capabilities in
reasoning tasks across different cognitive levels. We also release a new
open-source Chinese financial reasoning dataset covering 22 subfields to
support reproducible research and further advancements in financial reasoning.
Our experimental results reveal that LLM reasoning ability and higher-order
cognitive ability are the core factors influencing reasoning accuracy. We also
specifically find that even top models still face a bottleneck with knowledge
application. Furthermore, our analysis shows that specialized financial LLMs
generally lag behind the top general large models across multiple metrics.

Motivation: 解决传统手语识别方法在效率和准确性之间的权衡问题，以及梯度消失和高计算成本等挑战。

Method: 采用BART架构的编码器-解码器模型，独立编码x和y坐标，并通过交叉注意力维持其关联性。

Result: 模型在LSA-64数据集上达到96.04%的准确率，参数仅749,888，优于其他百万参数模型，并在其他数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为手语识别提供了一种可靠且高效的解决方案，有望提升聋人和听力障碍者的辅助工具。

Abstract: Sign language recognition is crucial for individuals with hearing impairments
to break communication barriers. However, previous approaches have had to
choose between efficiency and accuracy. Such as RNNs, LSTMs, and GCNs, had
problems with vanishing gradients and high computational costs. Despite
improving performance, transformer-based methods were not commonly used. This
study presents a new novel SLR approach that overcomes the challenge of
independently extracting meaningful information from the x and y coordinates of
skeleton sequences, which traditional models often treat as inseparable. By
utilizing an encoder-decoder of BART architecture, the model independently
encodes the x and y coordinates, while Cross-Attention ensures their
interrelation is maintained. With only 749,888 parameters, the model achieves
96.04% accuracy on the LSA-64 dataset, significantly outperforming previous
models with over one million parameters. The model also demonstrates excellent
performance and generalization across WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets. Ablation
studies underscore the importance of coordinate projection, normalization, and
using multiple skeleton components for boosting model efficacy. This study
offers a reliable and effective approach for sign language recognition, with
strong potential for enhancing accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

Conclusion: 该研究为开发高性能、高效且可解释的专业领域语言模型提供了可复现的框架。

Abstract: We present Gazal-R1, a 32-billion-parameter language model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance in medical reasoning while providing transparent,
step-by-step explanations for clinical decision-making. Built upon Qwen3 32B,
our model demonstrates that strategic training can enable mid-sized models to
outperform significantly larger counterparts in specialized domains. We
developed a novel two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning on
a carefully curated dataset of 107,033 synthetic medical reasoning examples
that teaches structured clinical thinking, enhanced by advanced
parameter-efficient techniques including Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation
(DoRA) and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA); second, reinforcement learning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a sophisticated multi-component
reward system that refines accuracy, format adherence, and reasoning quality.
Gazal-R1 achieves exceptional performance across medical benchmarks, scoring
87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing
models up to 12x larger. Beyond its strong empirical results, this work
provides detailed insights into the challenges of training reasoning-capable
models in specialized domains, including issues with reward hacking, training
instability, and the fundamental tension between factual recall and detailed
reasoning. Our methodology offers a reproducible framework for developing
high-capability, domain-specific language models that balance performance,
efficiency, and explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有LLM在非英语或中文语言中表现不佳，且其完整训练过程不公开，本文旨在低成本提升LLM对新语言的支持。

Method: 通过收集韩语数据集、预处理数据、训练模型、创建下游基准并进行评估，实现英语LLM到韩语的适配。

Result: 提出的方法高效且低成本，新模型Thunder-LLM和Thunder-LLM-Ins在韩语任务中表现优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM多语言适配提供了可行方案，代码公开共享。

Abstract: Since state-of-the-art LLMs often underperform in languages other than
English or Chinese, improving the capability of LLMs in new languages has
become an essential task. Moreover, LLMs' entire end-to-end training process
remains largely unknown to the public due to proprietary reasons, technical
complexity, inconsistent documentation, and ethical considerations. The
complete picture remains a closely guarded secret within the industry. This
paper presents methods to adapt an existing English-based LLM to Korean in a
low-budget scenario. We describe the entire end-to-end process: collecting
Korean datasets, preprocessing the data, training the model, creating
downstream benchmarks, and conducting evaluations. The evaluation results
indicate that our method can effectively and cost-efficiently add new language
capabilities to existing LLMs. Our new bilingual models, Thunder-LLM and
Thunder-LLM-Ins, achieve superior Korean performance compared to
state-of-the-art models while utilizing minimal data and computational
resources. We share our comprehensive experience and make the code publicly
available.

Conclusion: 研究为多模态AI驱动的学习指明了未来方向，需进一步优化模型对复杂教育内容的理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant
success in vision--language tasks. However, their capacity to reason over
complex, long lessons and intricate educational diagrams that cannot be
represented as a single natural image remains largely untested. In this work,
we present the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on the textbook
question answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We assess the
performance of recent vision-language models, including LLaVA and LLaMA
3.2-Vision, across various input configurations. Additionally, we introduce a
lightweight multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that
integrates both paragraphs and diagrams from the lesson into the prompt. Our
results demonstrate the influence of retrieved educational context on model
accuracy and reasoning, while also revealing current limitations in handling
question-context relationships and the potential for noise, pointing to key
directions for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning.

Conclusion: 结构化输入格式是提升MLLMs文档理解性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Document understanding remains a significant challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). While previous research has primarily focused on
locating evidence pages through precise multimodal queries, our work
investigates a fundamental yet overlooked aspect: how input format influences
document comprehension performance. Through systematic analysis, we discover
that raw OCR text often impairs rather than improves MLLMs' performance, which
is a counterintuitive finding we attribute to attention dispersion and
structure loss. To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel
structure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex
paradigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships
critical for comprehension. Our attention analysis reveals that structured text
induces structured attention patterns on both textual and visual content,
directing models to focus on semantically meaningful regions while reducing
attention waste. This approach significantly enhances MLLMs' document question
answering performance across diverse document types without requiring
architectural modifications or additional training.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）生成的文本真实性引发监管需求，现有水印方法难以同时满足文本质量、模型无关检测和多比特水印的要求。

Method: BiMark采用比特翻转无偏重加权机制、多层架构和信息编码方法，实现模型无关检测、高质量生成和多比特水印。

Result: 实验表明，BiMark在短文本中提取率提高30%，困惑度更低，且在摘要和翻译等下游任务中表现与非水印文本相当。

Conclusion: BiMark在平衡文本质量与水印能力方面表现出色，为LLM生成文本的识别提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised urgent concerns
about LLM-generated text authenticity, prompting regulatory demands for
reliable identification mechanisms. Although watermarking offers a promising
solution, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve three critical
requirements: text quality preservation, model-agnostic detection, and message
embedding capacity, which are crucial for practical implementation. To achieve
these goals, the key challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between text
quality preservation and message embedding capacity. To address this challenge,
we propose BiMark, a novel watermarking framework that achieves these
requirements through three key innovations: (1) a bit-flip unbiased reweighting
mechanism enabling model-agnostic detection, (2) a multilayer architecture
enhancing detectability without compromising generation quality, and (3) an
information encoding approach supporting multi-bit watermarking. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we validate that, compared to
state-of-the-art multi-bit watermarking methods, BiMark achieves up to 30%
higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality
indicated by lower perplexity, and performs comparably to non-watermarked text
on downstream tasks such as summarization and translation.

Abstract: Recent works have highlighted the significance of memory mechanisms in
LLM-based agents, which enable them to store observed information and adapt to
dynamic environments. However, evaluating their memory capabilities still
remains challenges. Previous evaluations are commonly limited by the diversity
of memory levels and interactive scenarios. They also lack comprehensive
metrics to reflect the memory capabilities from multiple aspects. To address
these problems, in this paper, we construct a more comprehensive dataset and
benchmark to evaluate the memory capability of LLM-based agents. Our dataset
incorporates factual memory and reflective memory as different levels, and
proposes participation and observation as various interactive scenarios. Based
on our dataset, we present a benchmark, named MemBench, to evaluate the memory
capability of LLM-based agents from multiple aspects, including their
effectiveness, efficiency, and capacity. To benefit the research community, we
release our dataset and project at https://github.com/import-myself/Membench.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新定义LLMs的角色，超越其作为自主智能或简单模仿工具的争议，探索其在文化演化中的潜力。

Method: 通过分析压缩、解压缩、外部化和递归四个特征，类比DNA的功能，论证LLMs的文化存储与重组能力。

Result: LLMs作为文化演化的工具，能够促进人类自我反思和低风险假设生成，而非替代人类智能。

Conclusion: LLMs的价值在于增强文化可演化性，为人类提供自我反思和创新的工具，同时依赖人类解释以保持文化相关性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel conceptualization of Large Language Models (LLMs)
as externalized informational substrates that function analogously to DNA for
human cultural dynamics. Rather than viewing LLMs as either autonomous
intelligence or mere programmed mimicry, we argue they serve a broader role as
repositories that preserve compressed patterns of human symbolic
expression--"fossils" of meaningful dynamics that retain relational residues
without their original living contexts. Crucially, these compressed patterns
only become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive
feedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately
catalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal
features--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we
demonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium
for preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference
to goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human
culture without containing understanding of embodied human experience.
Therefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human
intelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful
hypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework
positions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to
generate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human
interpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics
and norms.

*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi,Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORE-KG是一个模块化框架，用于从法律文本构建可解释的知识图谱，通过类型感知的共指消解和领域引导的实体关系提取，显著减少了节点重复和噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有知识图谱方法在处理法律文本时因共指消解不足和噪声问题导致的图谱质量低下。

Method: 采用两步流程：类型感知的共指消解和领域引导的实体关系提取，基于改进的GraphRAG框架。

Result: 节点重复减少33.28%，法律噪声减少38.37%，生成更清晰、连贯的图谱。

Conclusion: CORE-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer valuable insights but are unstructured, lexically
dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references-posing challenges for
automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing KG methods often rely on
static templates and lack coreference resolution, while recent LLM-based
approaches frequently produce noisy, fragmented graphs due to hallucinations,
and duplicate nodes caused by a lack of guided extraction. We propose CORE-KG,
a modular framework for building interpretable KGs from legal texts. It uses a
two-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via sequential,
structured LLM prompts, and (2) entity and relationship extraction using
domain-guided instructions, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework. CORE-KG
reduces node duplication by 33.28%, and legal noise by 38.37% compared to a
GraphRAG-based baseline-resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph
structures. These improvements make CORE-KG a strong foundation for analyzing
complex criminal networks.

Abstract: Recently, there have been notable advancements in large language models
(LLMs), demonstrating their growing abilities in complex reasoning. However,
existing research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of
these models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their
self-reflection pattern (also termed "Aha moment") and the interconnections
across diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the
reasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1,
DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge
paradigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their
final outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based
questions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step
problem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both
the coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research
results uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and
exploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning
process. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among
these models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the
reliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their
thinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1. This work offers
valuable insights into the trade-off between computational efficiency and
reasoning robustness and provides practical recommendations for enhancing model
design and evaluation in practical applications. We publicly release our

Motivation: 探索在多模态时间序列预测中，文本信息是否普遍有效，以及其发挥作用的具体条件。

Method: 在14个跨7个领域的预测任务上，评估了两种多模态预测范式：基于对齐的方法和基于提示的方法。

Result: 多模态方法并非在所有情况下优于单模态基线，性能提升依赖于模型架构和数据特性。

Conclusion: 文本信息在特定条件下（如高容量文本模型、互补数据信号）能提升预测性能，但并非普遍适用。

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual
information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it
remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration
consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across
a diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including
health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal
forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text
representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large
language models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from
multimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and
models, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest
unimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we
disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data
characteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side,
incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text
models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate
aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when
(4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary
predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone.
Our empirical findings offer practical guidelines for when multimodality can be
expected to aid forecasting tasks, and when it does not.

TL;DR: 论文提出AdaptGOT模型，结合自适应表示学习和GOT表示，解决POI嵌入中的多上下文采样不足等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前POI嵌入方法在多上下文采样、通用性和泛化能力方面存在不足，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: AdaptGOT模型包含上下文邻域生成、GOT表示增强和MoE自适应编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 在真实数据集和多个POI任务上验证了AdaptGOT的优越性能。

Conclusion: AdaptGOT模型有效解决了POI嵌入中的关键挑战，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Currently, considerable strides have been achieved in Point-of-Interest (POI)
embedding methodologies, driven by the emergence of novel POI tasks like
recommendation and classification. Despite the success of task-specific,
end-to-end models in POI embedding, several challenges remain. These include
the need for more effective multi-context sampling strategies, insufficient
exploration of multiple POI contexts, limited versatility, and inadequate
generalization. To address these issues, we propose the AdaptGOT model, which
integrates both the (Adapt)ive representation learning technique and the
Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text (GOT) representation with a particular emphasis
on Geographical location, Co-Occurrence and Textual information. The AdaptGOT
model comprises three key components: (1) contextual neighborhood generation,
which integrates advanced mixed sampling techniques such as KNN, density-based,
importance-based, and category-aware strategies to capture complex contextual
neighborhoods; (2) an advanced GOT representation enhanced by an attention
mechanism, designed to derive high-quality, customized representations and
efficiently capture complex interrelations between POIs; and (3) the MoE-based
adaptive encoder-decoder architecture, which ensures topological consistency
and enriches contextual representation by minimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence
across varying contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets and multiple
POI tasks substantiate the superior performance of the proposed AdaptGOT model.

TL;DR: LastingBench是一个新框架，旨在通过扰动和重写泄漏点来减少大型语言模型在QA基准测试中的记忆效应，从而提升基准的长期有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在QA基准测试中可能通过记忆任务特定数据来“作弊”，这削弱了基准评估的有效性。现有研究多关注检测泄漏，而忽略了缓解其影响和保护基准长期效用的方法。

Method: LastingBench通过扰动识别上下文中的泄漏点，并将其重写为反事实内容，以破坏模型的记忆效应，同时保留基准的原始评估意图。

Result: 对最先进的QA基准测试的评估显示，LastingBench显著减少了记忆效应，揭示了性能差距。

Conclusion: LastingBench提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，确保基准测试的长期稳健性，促进对LLMs更公平和可解释的评估。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) raises concerns
about their ability to "cheat" on standard Question Answering (QA) benchmarks
by memorizing task-specific data. This undermines the validity of benchmark
evaluations, as they no longer reflect genuine model capabilities but instead
the effects of data leakage. While prior work has focused on detecting such
leakage, little attention has been given to mitigating its impact and
preserving the long-term utility of benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce
LastingBench, a novel framework designed to continuously reinforce and
safeguard existing benchmarks against knowledge leakage. LastingBench
identifies leakage points in the context through perturbation, then rewrites
the leakage points to counterfactual ones-disrupting memorization while
preserving the benchmark's original evaluative intent. Evaluations of
state-of-the-art QA benchmarks show significant performance gaps, highlighting
the efficacy of LastingBench in reducing memorization effects. LastingBench
offers a practical and scalable solution to ensure benchmark robustness over
time, promoting fairer and more interpretable evaluations of LLMs.

TL;DR: GARMLE-G框架通过检索权威临床指南内容生成无幻觉的医疗语言模型输出，提升临床实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗语言模型依赖ICD代码，无法捕捉临床医生的复杂推理过程，限制了模型的临床效用。

Method: GARMLE-G结合LLM预测和EHR数据生成查询，检索相关临床指南内容，并融合生成临床对齐的建议。

Result: 原型系统在高血压诊断中表现优于RAG基线，检索精度、语义相关性和指南依从性更优。

Conclusion: GARMLE-G提供了一种可扩展、低成本且无幻觉的方法，适用于临床实践中的广泛部署。

Abstract: Current medical language models, adapted from large language models (LLMs),
typically predict ICD code-based diagnosis from electronic health records
(EHRs) because these labels are readily available. However, ICD codes do not
capture the nuanced, context-rich reasoning clinicians use for diagnosis.
Clinicians synthesize diverse patient data and reference clinical practice
guidelines (CPGs) to make evidence-based decisions. This misalignment limits
the clinical utility of existing models. We introduce GARMLE-G, a
Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework that grounds medical language model
outputs in authoritative CPGs. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented
Generation based approaches, GARMLE-G enables hallucination-free outputs by
directly retrieving authoritative guideline content without relying on
model-generated text. It (1) integrates LLM predictions with EHR data to create
semantically rich queries, (2) retrieves relevant CPG knowledge snippets via
embedding similarity, and (3) fuses guideline content with model output to
generate clinically aligned recommendations. A prototype system for
hypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics,
demonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical
guideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a
lightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment. This
work provides a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for grounding
medical language models in evidence-based clinical practice, with strong
potential for broader clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在开放领域时间线摘要中存在主题相关性评估和时间演化理解的困难，导致摘要中常包含无关信息或不准确时间戳。

Method: 提出TIM模型，采用渐进优化策略，包括指令调优和双对齐奖励学习方法，结合语义和时间视角提升摘要能力。

Result: TIM在开放领域实验中表现出强大的时间线摘要能力。

Conclusion: TIM通过渐进优化策略有效解决了开放领域时间线摘要的挑战。

Abstract: Open-domain Timeline Summarization (TLS) is crucial for monitoring the
evolution of news topics. To identify changes in news topics, existing methods
typically employ general Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize relevant
timestamps from retrieved news. While general LLMs demonstrate capabilities in
zero-shot news summarization and timestamp localization, they struggle with
assessing topic relevance and understanding topic evolution. Consequently, the
summarized information often includes irrelevant details or inaccurate
timestamps. To address these issues, we propose the first large Timeline
Intelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain TLS, which is capable of effectively
summarizing open-domain timelines. Specifically, we begin by presenting a
large-scale TLS dataset, comprising over 1,000 news topics and more than 3,000
annotated TLS instances. Furthermore, we propose a progressive optimization
strategy, which gradually enhance summarization performance. It employs
instruction tuning to enhance summarization and topic-irrelevant information
filtering capabilities. Following this, it exploits a novel dual-alignment
reward learning method that incorporates both semantic and temporal
perspectives, thereby improving the understanding of topic evolution
principles. Through this progressive optimization strategy, TIM demonstrates a
robust ability to summarize open-domain timelines. Extensive experiments in
open-domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our TIM.

TL;DR: IndexTTS2提出了一种新的自回归模型友好的语音时长控制方法，支持精确时长控制和自由生成模式，并实现了音色与情感的分离控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归TTS模型在语音自然度上有优势，但难以精确控制合成语音的时长，限制了其在需要严格音视频同步的应用（如视频配音）中的使用。

Method: IndexTTS2通过两种生成模式控制时长，并利用GPT潜在表示增强稳定性，同时设计了基于文本描述的软指令机制以实现情感控制。

Result: 实验表明，IndexTTS2在零样本TTS任务中，在词错误率、说话人相似度和情感保真度上优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: IndexTTS2为自回归TTS模型提供了更灵活的时长和情感控制能力，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models are typically categorized into
autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. Although autoregressive systems
exhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token
generation mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of
synthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video
dubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces
IndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for
speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows
explicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration
control; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely
generate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input
prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional
expression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and
emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the
emotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a
separate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to
reconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance
clarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent
representations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier
for emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual
descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3. This enables effective guidance of speech
generation with desired emotional tendencies using natural language input.
Experimental results demonstrate that IndexTTS2 outperforms existing
state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity,
and emotional fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在政治相关在线讨论中的表现及其潜在影响。

Method: 通过三个实验，让GPT-4模拟真实或虚构的党派用户生成评论，分析其政治立场、情感和语言特征，并与真实用户评论及基准模型对比。

Result: GPT-4能生成逼真的评论，但更易制造共识；真实与人工评论在语义空间中有区分，但人工检查难以辨别。

Conclusion: LLMs可能被用于潜入在线讨论并影响政治辩论，对AI驱动的言论操纵具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for
natural language generation, with applications spanning from content creation
to social simulations. Their ability to mimic human interactions raises both
opportunities and concerns, particularly in the context of politically relevant
online discussions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in
replicating user-generated content within a real-world, divisive scenario:
Reddit conversations during the 2016 US Presidential election. In particular,
we conduct three different experiments, asking GPT-4 to generate comments by
impersonating either real or artificial partisan users. We analyze the
generated comments in terms of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic
features, comparing them against real user contributions and benchmarking
against a null model. We find that GPT-4 is able to produce realistic comments,
both in favor of or against the candidate supported by the community, yet
tending to create consensus more easily than dissent. In addition we show that
real and artificial comments are well separated in a semantically embedded
space, although they are indistinguishable by manual inspection. Our findings
provide insights on the potential use of LLMs to sneak into online discussions,
influence political debate and shape political narratives, bearing broader
implications of AI-driven discourse manipulation.

Conclusion: OPC为数学证明生成研究提供了重要资源，并展示了其在模型训练中的实用性。

Abstract: In recent months, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in mathematical proof generation, but further advancement is hindered by the
lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset of human-evaluated proofs. While
expensive to create, such a dataset is essential for driving improvements in
training and enabling a rigorous analysis of proof generation capabilities. In
this work, we present the Open Proof Corpus (OPC), a dataset comprising over
5,000 human-evaluated proofs produced by state-of-the-art LLMs. The OPC was
specifically designed for broad applicability and downstream usage in proof
generation research and is the first to include a substantial number of
correct, LLM-generated solutions to problems from prestigious mathematics
competitions such as the USAMO and IMO. Using the OPC, we explore critical
questions in automated proof generation: (1) the performance gap between
natural language and formal proof generation, (2) the discrepancy between
final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity, and (3) the impact of best-of-n
selection on proof quality. Finally, to showcase the utility of the OPC, we
finetune an 8B-parameter model on the dataset, obtaining a model that performs
on par with the best model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, on the task of evaluating proof
correctness.

propose a practical and lightweight pipeline to personalize ASR models,
formalizing the selection of words and enriching a small, speech-impaired
dataset with semantic coherence. Applied to data from a child with a structural
speech impairment, our approach shows promising improvements in transcription
quality, demonstrating the potential to reduce communication barriers for
individuals with atypical speech patterns.

Abstract: Extracting molecular structure-activity relationships (SARs) from scientific
literature and patents is essential for drug discovery and materials research.
However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats
and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches
relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts,
while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient
accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and
optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we
introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific
documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods.
Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates
domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading
end-to-end baselines. Specifically, Doc2SAR attains an overall Table Recall of
80.78% on DocSAR-200, exceeding end2end GPT-4o by 51.48%. Furthermore, Doc2SAR
demonstrates practical usability through efficient inference and is accompanied
by a web app.

*Li Zhou,Hao Jiang,Junjie Li,Zefeng Zhao,Feng Jiang,Wenyu Chen,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过信息论视角提出了一种探测框架，评估显式结构建模对语言模型表示的作用，并探讨MLPs作为GNNs高效替代方案的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现GNNs未能充分利用结构信息，而MLPs在结构感知任务中表现优异，因此探索MLPs的潜力。

Method: 引入模块化探测框架，分离评估GNN的消息传递和特征转换操作，使用Edge Probing Suite进行实验。

Result: MLPs作为特征转换模块能提升语言模型表示中的语言学知识，而仅依赖消息传递的模型表现较差。

Conclusion: MLPs在结构建模中具有潜力，可作为GNNs的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Explicit structural information has been proven to be encoded by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), serving as auxiliary knowledge to enhance model capabilities
and improve performance in downstream NLP tasks. However, recent studies
indicate that GNNs fail to fully utilize structural information, whereas
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), despite lacking the message-passing mechanisms
inherent to GNNs, exhibit a surprising ability in structure-aware tasks.
Motivated by these findings, this paper introduces a comprehensive probing
framework from an information-theoretic perspective. The framework is designed
to systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing
language model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as
efficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs. We extend traditional probing
classifiers by incorporating a control module that allows for selective use of
either the full GNN model or its decoupled components, specifically, the
message-passing and feature-transformation operations.This modular approach
isolates and assesses the individual contributions of these operations,
avoiding confounding effects from the complete GNN architecture. Using the Edge
Probing Suite, a diagnostic tool for evaluating the linguistic knowledge
encoded in LMs, we find that MLPs, when used as feature-transformation modules,
consistently improve the linguistic knowledge captured in LM representations
across different architectures. They effectively encode both syntactic and
semantic patterns. Similarly, GNNs that incorporate feature-transformation
operations show beneficial effects. In contrast, models that rely solely on
message-passing operations tend to underperform, often leading to negative
impacts on probing task performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语言多样性和标注数据有限，孟加拉语方言的情感分析研究不足。

Method: 创建包含政治、宗教和中性内容的双语标注数据集，采用多类主题和多标签情感标注，并通过专家翻译和一致性检验确保质量。

Result: 数据集质量高，标注一致性强，为低资源方言情感分析提供了可靠资源。

Conclusion: ANUBHUTI填补了孟加拉语方言情感分析的资源空白，提升了自然语言处理的准确性和语境感知能力。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis for regional dialects of Bangla remains an underexplored
area due to linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. This paper
introduces ANUBHUTI, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2000 sentences
manually translated from standard Bangla into four major regional dialects
Mymensingh, Noakhali, Sylhet, and Chittagong. The dataset predominantly
features political and religious content, reflecting the contemporary socio
political landscape of Bangladesh, alongside neutral texts to maintain balance.
Each sentence is annotated using a dual annotation scheme: multiclass thematic
labeling categorizes sentences as Political, Religious, or Neutral, and
multilabel emotion annotation assigns one or more emotions from Anger,
Contempt, Disgust, Enjoyment, Fear, Sadness, and Surprise. Expert native
translators conducted the translation and annotation, with quality assurance
performed via Cohens Kappa inter annotator agreement, achieving strong
consistency across dialects. The dataset was further refined through systematic
checks for missing data, anomalies, and inconsistencies. ANUBHUTI fills a
critical gap in resources for sentiment analysis in low resource Bangla
dialects, enabling more accurate and context aware natural language processing.

Motivation: 探索自监督语音Transformer模型如何编码说话者信息，填补研究空白。

Method: 分析前馈层中与k-means聚类和i-vector相关的神经元，识别与说话者信息相关的神经元。

Result: 这些神经元与广泛的语音和性别类别相关，剪枝时保护它们可显著保留说话者任务性能。

Conclusion: 这些神经元在编码说话者信息中起关键作用，保护它们有助于模型性能的保持。

Abstract: In recent years, the impact of self-supervised speech Transformers has
extended to speaker-related applications. However, little research has explored
how these models encode speaker information. In this work, we address this gap
by identifying neurons in the feed-forward layers that are correlated with
speaker information. Specifically, we analyze neurons associated with k-means
clusters of self-supervised features and i-vectors. Our analysis reveals that
these clusters correspond to broad phonetic and gender classes, making them
suitable for identifying neurons that represent speakers. By protecting these
neurons during pruning, we can significantly preserve performance on
speaker-related task, demonstrating their crucial role in encoding speaker
information.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在自动事实核查系统中的知识偏见影响，分析了HerO系统在FEVER-25基准上的表现，发现模型的知识偏见和人为注入偏见对结果有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动事实核查系统越来越多地依赖LLM，了解这些模型的参数知识偏见如何影响事实核查结果变得至关重要。

Method: 通过实验分析Llama 3.1模型的知识偏见和人为注入偏见对事实核查的影响，包括直接提示和生成支持/反驳文档的实验。

Result: 模型在直接提示下对近一半的声明标记为“证据不足”，而在生成文档实验中，提示显著影响检索结果，但最终预测结果相对稳定。

Conclusion: LLM的知识偏见和提示策略对事实核查有显著影响，但最终预测结果表现出一定的稳定性。

Abstract: Automatic fact verification systems increasingly rely on large language
models (LLMs). We investigate how parametric knowledge biases in these models
affect fact-checking outcomes of the HerO system (baseline for FEVER-25). We
examine how the system is affected by: (1) potential bias in Llama 3.1's
parametric knowledge and (2) intentionally injected bias. When prompted
directly to perform fact-verification, Llama 3.1 labels nearly half the claims
as "Not Enough Evidence". Using only its parametric knowledge it is able to
reach a verdict on the remaining half of the claims. In the second experiment,
we prompt the model to generate supporting, refuting, or neutral fact-checking
documents. These prompts significantly influence retrieval outcomes, with
approximately 50\% of retrieved evidence being unique to each perspective.
Notably, the model sometimes refuses to generate supporting documents for
claims it believes to be false, creating an inherent negative bias. Despite
differences in retrieved evidence, final verdict predictions show stability
across prompting strategies. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为TLQA的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在时间引用列表问答任务中的表现，揭示了模型在时间对齐和列表构建能力上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在时间理解任务中容易产生幻觉和错误，现有研究未充分评估模型在列表答案构建中的时间理解能力。

Method: 提出了TLQA基准测试，要求模型生成与时间对齐的结构化列表答案，并在闭卷和开放域设置下评估模型的性能。

Result: 研究发现当前模型在闭卷设置中无法提供完整答案和时间对齐的事实，开放域设置中检索能力有待改进。

Conclusion: TLQA基准测试为未来研究提供了明确方向，代码和基准已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense advances in a wide
range of natural language tasks. However, these models are susceptible to
hallucinations and errors on particularly temporal understanding tasks
involving multiple entities in answers. In such tasks, they fail to associate
entities with accurate time intervals, generate a complete list of entities in
answers or reason about events associated with specific temporal bounds.
Existing works do not extensively evaluate the abilities of the model to
perform implicit and explicit temporal understanding in a list answer
construction setup. To bridge this gap, we propose the Time referenced List
based Question Answering or TLQA benchmark that requires structured answers in
list format aligned with corresponding time periods. Our TLQA benchmark,
requires both list construction and temporal understanding simultaneously,
which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored in prior benchmarks.
We investigate the temporal understanding and list construction capabilities of
state-of-the-art generative models on TLQA in closed-book and open-domain
settings. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current models,
particularly their inability to provide complete answers and temporally align
facts in a closed-book setup and the need to improve retrieval in open-domain
setup, providing clear future directions for research on TLQA. The benchmark

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于XLNet的自动攻击性语言检测模型，并与BERT进行比较，结果显示XLNet在检测攻击性内容和分类攻击类型上表现更优，而BERT在识别攻击目标上略胜一筹。此外，过采样和欠采样策略有效解决了类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上攻击性内容的增加需要自动化检测系统，而深度学习模型（如XLNet和BERT）在自然语言处理中表现出色。

Method: 使用XLNet和BERT模型，基于OLID数据集进行实验，并采用过采样和欠采样策略处理类别不平衡。

Result: XLNet在检测攻击性内容和分类攻击类型上优于BERT，而BERT在识别攻击目标上表现更好。过采样和欠采样策略提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: XLNet和迁移学习架构在构建鲁棒的社交媒体攻击性语言检测系统方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The widespread use of text-based communication on social media-through chats,
comments, and microblogs-has improved user interaction but has also led to an
increase in offensive content, including hate speech, racism, and other forms
of abuse. Due to the enormous volume of user-generated content, manual
moderation is impractical, which creates a need for automated systems that can
detect offensive language. Deep learning models, particularly those using
transfer learning, have demonstrated significant success in understanding
natural language through large-scale pretraining. In this study, we propose an
automatic offensive language detection model based on XLNet, a generalized
autoregressive pretraining method, and compare its performance with BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which is a widely
used baseline in natural language processing (NLP). Both models are evaluated
using the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), a benchmark Twitter
dataset that includes hierarchical annotations. Our experimental results show
that XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and in categorizing
the types of offenses, while BERT performs slightly better in identifying the
targets of the offenses. Additionally, we find that oversampling and
undersampling strategies are effective in addressing class imbalance and
improving classification performance. These findings highlight the potential of
transfer learning and XLNet-based architectures to create robust systems for
detecting offensive language on social media platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的决策过程缺乏透明性，阻碍了其在高风险领域的应用，因此需要系统化的XAI方法提升解释性。

Method: 通过分类LLMs的架构（编码器、解码器、编码器-解码器），综述并评估了XAI方法，并探讨其应用和评估标准。

Result: 总结了现有XAI技术的分类、评估方法和实际应用，揭示了当前研究的局限性。

Conclusion: 未来需继续开发透明且负责任的LLMs，解决现有挑战并推动XAI技术的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in advancing
Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, despite their achievements, LLMs often
struggle to explain their decision-making processes, making them a 'black box'
and presenting a substantial challenge to explainability. This lack of
transparency poses a significant obstacle to the adoption of LLMs in
high-stakes domain applications, where interpretability is particularly
essential. To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that provide
human-interpretable explanations for LLMs. However, a systematic understanding
of these methods remains limited. To address this gap, this survey provides a
comprehensive review of explainability techniques by categorizing XAI methods
based on the underlying transformer architectures of LLMs: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. Then these techniques are examined in
terms of their evaluation for assessing explainability, and the survey further
explores how these explanations are leveraged in practical applications.
Finally, it discusses available resources, ongoing research challenges, and
future directions, aiming to guide continued efforts toward developing
transparent and responsible LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了科学英语中词汇频率的突然变化，特别是由大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）引起的语义和语用变化，而非简单的同义词替换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来科学英语词汇频率的显著变化，尤其是某些词汇（如'delve'、'intricate'、'crucial'）的突然增加，引发了对其背后原因和结构的探究。

Method: 通过分析PubMed科学摘要中的频率趋势，结合词性标注，系统研究了同义词组的词汇变化。

Result: 发现语义集群整体变化，表明变化主要是语义和语用层面的；同时观察到某些词汇（如'important'）的显著下降。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型对语言的影响主要是语义和语用的，而非单纯的词汇替换，这有助于理解语言技术如何塑造人类语言。

Abstract: Scientific English has undergone rapid and unprecedented changes in recent
years, with words such as "delve," "intricate," and "crucial" showing
significant spikes in frequency since around 2022. These changes are widely
attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in
the discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in
frequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.
The present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve
the replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, "crucial"
replacing "essential" and "key," or whether they reflect broader semantic and
pragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include
part of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over
grammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like "potential"
as a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for
widely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific
abstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift
together, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern
suggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic
and pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective "important"
shows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze
decreasing lexical items. Our analysis of "collapsing" words reveals a more
complex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts
with the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of
language change contribute to our understanding of how language technology
continues to shape human language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯古典诗歌的语言、风格和韵律复杂性给计算作者归属带来了挑战，需要一种综合方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用多输入神经网络框架，结合Transformer语言编码器、Word2Vec嵌入、风格测量和韵律编码，使用647,653节诗句进行训练和验证。

Result: 加权投票方案达到71%的准确率，高置信度阈值下（0.9）准确率提升至97%，但覆盖率降低。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了深度表征与领域特征结合在作者归属中的潜力，为风格分析、作者争议和计算文学研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The intricate linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects of Persian
classical poetry pose a challenge for computational authorship attribution. In
this work, we present a versatile framework to determine authorship among 67
prominent poets. We employ a multi-input neural framework consisting of a
transformer-based language encoder complemented by features addressing the
semantic, stylometric, and metrical dimensions of Persian poetry. Our feature
set encompasses 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric
measures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter. We compiled a
vast corpus of 647,653 verses of the Ganjoor digital collection, validating the
data through strict preprocessing and author verification while preserving
poem-level splitting to prevent overlap. This work employs verse-level
classification and majority and weighted voting schemes in evaluation,
revealing that weighted voting yields 71% accuracy. We further investigate
threshold-based decision filtering, allowing the model to generate highly
confident predictions, achieving 97% accuracy at a 0.9 threshold, though at
lower coverage. Our work focuses on the integration of deep representational
forms with domain-specific features for improved authorship attribution. The
results illustrate the potential of our approach for automated classification
and the contribution to stylistic analysis, authorship disputes, and general
computational literature research. This research will facilitate further
research on multilingual author attribution, style shift, and generative
modeling of Persian poetry.

Conclusion: LinguaSynth为可解释且高效的NLP模型设定了新标准，挑战了深度学习在文本分类中的必要性。

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced NLP, but its reliance on large
black-box models introduces critical interpretability and computational
efficiency concerns. This paper proposes LinguaSynth, a novel text
classification framework that strategically integrates five complementary
linguistic feature types: lexical, syntactic, entity-level, word-level
semantics, and document-level semantics within a transparent logistic
regression model. Unlike transformer-based architectures, LinguaSynth maintains
interpretability and computational efficiency, achieving an accuracy of 84.89
percent on the 20 Newsgroups dataset and surpassing a robust TF-IDF baseline by
3.32 percent. Through rigorous feature interaction analysis, we show that
syntactic and entity-level signals provide essential disambiguation and
effectively complement distributional semantics. LinguaSynth sets a new
benchmark for interpretable, resource-efficient NLP models and challenges the
prevailing assumption that deep neural networks are necessary for
high-performing text classification.

Conclusion: 一致性假设的实证研究为黑盒UQ方法提供了实用价值，展示了生成一致性作为置信度代理的有效性。

Abstract: Estimating the confidence of large language model (LLM) outputs is essential
for real-world applications requiring high user trust. Black-box uncertainty
quantification (UQ) methods, relying solely on model API access, have gained
popularity due to their practical benefits. In this paper, we examine the
implicit assumption behind several UQ methods, which use generation consistency
as a proxy for confidence, an idea we formalize as the consistency hypothesis.
We introduce three mathematical statements with corresponding statistical tests
to capture variations of this hypothesis and metrics to evaluate LLM output
conformity across tasks. Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark
datasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL),
highlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the
statements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and
demonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods
that aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation.
These approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical
value of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.

Conclusion: 句法结构的构建是一个自底向上的过程，宏句法结构的整合时机对模型性能至关重要。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that neural language models encode syntactic
structures in their internal representations, yet the derivations by which
these structures are constructed across layers remain poorly understood. In
this paper, we propose Derivational Probing to investigate how micro-syntactic
structures (e.g., subject noun phrases) and macro-syntactic structures (e.g.,
the relationship between the root verbs and their direct dependents) are
constructed as word embeddings propagate upward across layers. Our experiments
on BERT reveal a clear bottom-up derivation: micro-syntactic structures emerge
in lower layers and are gradually integrated into a coherent macro-syntactic
structure in higher layers. Furthermore, a targeted evaluation on subject-verb
number agreement shows that the timing of constructing macro-syntactic
structures is critical for downstream performance, suggesting an optimal timing
for integrating global syntactic information.

Motivation: 原生MLLM因语音-文本数据不足导致性能下降和灾难性遗忘，需要一种方法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出DeepTalk框架，基于MoE架构自适应区分模态专家，分别进行单模态训练和多模态协作训练。

Result: 性能损失仅5.5%，远低于原生MLLM的20%，延迟保持在0.5秒内。

Conclusion: DeepTalk在性能和延迟上表现优异，为智能语音交互提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large
language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech
and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs
preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and
generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a
separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response
latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from
catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available
paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs
compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To
address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality
expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk
first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality
load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized
single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training.
As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the
original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of
over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par
with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within
0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o have
demonstrated strong capabilities of direct speech interaction. However, the
lack of specialized and comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end speech LLM
evaluation hinders optimizing the user experience of Audio LLMs in real-world
applications. Existing evaluation methods often adapt text-based benchmarks,
overlooking speech's unique characteristics and challenges, including prosody,
homophones, stuttering, and differing user expectations. Here, we present a
novel approach to thoroughly evaluate LLMs in practical speech conversations.
We systematically curate real-world chat data relevant to spoken scenarios,
introduce diversity in speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment
the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. We further design a query-aware
evaluation method to use customized evaluation checklists and prompts to
enhance the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We conduct comprehensive testing
and detailed analysis of various mainstream speech models, revealing
significant differences in model performance across different speech scenarios.
The use of query-aware evaluation further enables a finer-grained assessment
under various speech-specific scenarios. Our benchmark can provide valuable
insights for speech model development and evaluation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个两阶段框架（感知与预测）来系统评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）作为世界模型（WMs）的能力，并引入WM-ABench基准测试。实验发现当前VLMs在基础世界建模能力上存在显著局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估VLMs作为通用世界模型的潜力，填补对其基础世界建模能力系统性评估的空白。

Method: 提出两阶段评估框架（感知与预测），设计WM-ABench基准，覆盖23个细粒度维度，并在6个模拟环境中进行660次实验。

Result: 实验显示VLMs在基础世界建模能力上表现不佳，例如运动轨迹区分准确率接近随机，且缺乏解耦理解能力。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs与世界建模的人类水平存在显著差距，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and
predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning.
Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI o3, GPT-4o and
Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have
evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual
understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities
remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we
propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial,
temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation,
transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation
of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse
simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 660
experiments on 15 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these
models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For
instance, almost all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing
motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding --
e.g., some models tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones.
More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and
human-level world modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs在不同语言和文化背景下的行为，尤其是在可能影响公众意见或强化主流叙事的场景中。

Method: 两阶段评估：阶段1评估事实性问题的一致性；阶段2探讨地缘政治敏感争议中的偏差。

Result: 阶段1显示查询语言诱导的偏差；阶段2反映模型训练背景与查询语言的交互作用。

Conclusion: 提出了评估LLMs行为的结构化框架，为多语言环境中的部署和文化感知评估提供见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
linguistic and cultural contexts, understanding their behavior in both factual
and disputable scenarios is essential, especially when their outputs may shape
public opinion or reinforce dominant narratives. In this paper, we define two
types of bias in LLMs: model bias (bias stemming from model training) and
inference bias (bias induced by the language of the query), through a two-phase
evaluation. Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single
verifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across
different query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically
sensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or
ideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset
spanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question
types. The results show that Phase 1 exhibits query language induced alignment,
while Phase 2 reflects an interplay between the model's training context and
query language. This paper offers a structured framework for evaluating LLM
behavior across neutral and sensitive topics, providing insights for future LLM
deployment and culturally aware evaluation practices in multilingual contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在语言模型训练中，如何直接获取适合多任务能力的数据组合是一个未解决的问题，因为数据与任务之间的关系难以建模。

Method: 通过观察训练轨迹中检查点模型的能力表现，利用其一阶影响力近似作为数据混合信号，优化数据组合。

Result: 在八个推理基准测试中，该方法显著提升了预训练模型的性能，最高提升达1.93%。

Conclusion: 检查点模型具有潜力提升数据质量和优化数据组合，为语言模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: In language model training, it is desirable to equip models with capabilities
from various tasks. However, it is not clear how to directly obtain the right
data mixtures for these capabilities as the relationship between data and tasks
is difficult to be modeled. In this work, we observe that checkpoint models
exhibit emerging capabilities at different points in the training trajectory.
Often, the training process saves checkpoints as artifacts that are
under-utilized as a source of in-training data signals. We identify these
artifact models based on their respective capabilities on the benchmarks and
leverage them as data mixers by using their aggregated first-order influence
approximation over source data. We demonstrated on eight reasoning benchmarks
that the proposed framework shows significant improvements in the pretraining
setting, with performance improvements of up to 1.93%. Overall, this shows the
potential of checkpoint models to enhance data quality and optimize data
mixtures.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在角色扮演场景中的表现和偏见，特别是在移民检查情境下，基于ERG理论分析其决策模式。

Method: 构建3700个道德困境，LLMs作为移民检查员根据短篇叙述决定是否批准入境，叙述基于ERG理论分类人类需求。

Result: 分析六个LLMs显示其决策存在显著模式，隐含偏好明显；社会身份的引入导致不同响应，部分模型对边缘化身份拒绝率更高。

Conclusion: LLMs在道德决策中表现出系统性偏好，对社会身份的响应差异显著，数据公开以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance and biases of large language models (LLMs) through
role-playing scenarios is becoming increasingly common, as LLMs often exhibit
biased behaviors in these contexts. Building on this line of research, we
introduce PapersPlease, a benchmark consisting of 3,700 moral dilemmas designed
to investigate LLMs' decision-making in prioritizing various levels of human
needs. In our setup, LLMs act as immigration inspectors deciding whether to
approve or deny entry based on the short narratives of people. These narratives
are constructed using the Existence, Relatedness, and Growth (ERG) theory,
which categorizes human needs into three hierarchical levels. Our analysis of
six LLMs reveals statistically significant patterns in decision-making,
suggesting that LLMs encode implicit preferences. Additionally, our evaluation
of the impact of incorporating social identities into the narratives shows
varying responsiveness based on both motivational needs and identity cues, with
some models exhibiting higher denial rates for marginalized identities. All
data is publicly available at https://github.com/yeonsuuuu28/papers-please.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究指出当前工具集成LLM代理的评估多关注端到端工具使用，而忽略稳定性问题，导致实际应用受限。研究发现代理在整个工具调用过程中易出错，开源模型代理更脆弱，增大模型规模未必提升稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估忽视代理稳定性，影响其实际应用，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过实验分析代理在工具调用各阶段（读取文档、选择工具、生成参数、处理响应）的脆弱性。

Result: 代理在各阶段均易出错，开源模型代理更脆弱，增大模型规模未显著提升稳定性。

Conclusion: 强调评估代理稳定性的重要性，为未来LLM开发和评估提供洞见。

Abstract: Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on
end-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits
their real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can
cause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by
investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire
tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools
and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through
extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors
at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than
those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size
does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents
more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights
the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for
future LLM development and evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种混合方法（GCG + PAIR和GCG + WordGame），结合令牌级和提示级攻击技术，显著提高了对预训练语言模型的越狱成功率，并揭示了现有安全措施的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练语言模型（PTLMs）和大语言模型（LLMs）广泛应用，但其安全性仍面临令牌级和提示级越狱攻击的威胁。现有攻击方法各有局限性，需要更有效的混合技术。

Method: 提出两种混合攻击方法：GCG + PAIR和GCG + WordGame，结合令牌级和提示级技术的优势，并在多个Vicuna和Llama模型上评估其效果。

Result: GCG + PAIR在未防御模型上的攻击成功率（ASR）达到91.6%，显著高于单一技术；GCG + WordGame在严格评估下仍保持80%以上的ASR。两种方法均能突破高级防御措施。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前安全堆栈的漏洞，强调了在攻击成功率和防御鲁棒性之间的权衡，并呼吁开发更全面的安全措施以应对自适应攻击。

Abstract: The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications.
Despite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit
their inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary
inference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks.
Token-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box
models like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token
optimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs
to elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be
unreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we
propose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques
to enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the
newly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and
Llama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its
constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its
Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's
58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of
WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like
Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and
reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which
fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported
vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw
success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic
safeguards against adaptive adversaries.

Method: 方法包括提出社交网络模拟的正式框架，并测试不同方法在英语和德语社交网络上模仿用户行为的效果。

Result: 结果表明，社交模拟应通过其拟合场景中的实证真实性进行验证。

Conclusion: 结论是呼吁在基于生成代理的社会模拟中应用更严谨的方法。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior triggered
a plethora of computational social science research, assuming that empirical
studies of humans can be conducted with AI agents instead. Since there have
been conflicting research findings on whether and when this hypothesis holds,
there is a need to better understand the differences in their experimental
designs. We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the
use of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we
provide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before
focusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test
different approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our
findings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical
realism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted.
With this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based
modeling for social simulation.

Motivation: 预训练的Transformer模型在通用领域表现优异，但在特定领域（如驾驶舱对话）中性能下降，因此需要改进。

Method: 收集驾驶舱模拟器和飞行员访谈录音，手动标注数据，提出多种规范化方案，并采用LoRA进行高效微调。

Result: WER从68.49%降至26.26%，显著提升了转录准确性。

Conclusion: 通过规范化方案和微调，Whisper模型在驾驶舱对话转录中的性能得到显著提升。

Abstract: The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to
significant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The
pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few
epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong
generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does
suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the
cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual
conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy
of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85
minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings
with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men
speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we
propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve
Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance,
utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \% (pretrained whisper Large model without
normalization baseline) to 26.26\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the
proposed normalization scheme).

Motivation: 探讨机器翻译在儿童文学翻译中的表现，尤其是大语言模型是否能接近人工翻译的风格。

Method: 构建《彼得潘》语料库，包含21种翻译（7种HT、7种LLM、7种NMT），使用447种语言特征进行风格计量分析。

Result: 在通用特征上，HT与MT差异显著；在创意文本翻译特征上，LLMs表现优于NMTs，更接近HT风格。

Conclusion: LLMs在儿童文学翻译中具有潜力，尤其在风格特征上接近人工翻译。

Abstract: This study focuses on evaluating the performance of machine translations
(MTs) compared to human translations (HTs) in English-to-Chinese children's
literature translation (CLT) from a stylometric perspective. The research
constructs a Peter Pan corpus, comprising 21 translations: 7 human translations
(HTs), 7 large language model translations (LLMs), and 7 neural machine
translation outputs (NMTs). The analysis employs a generic feature set
(including lexical, syntactic, readability, and n-gram features) and a creative
text translation (CTT-specific) feature set, which captures repetition, rhythm,
translatability, and miscellaneous levels, yielding 447 linguistic features in
total.
  Using classification and clustering techniques in machine learning, we
conduct a stylometric analysis of these translations. Results reveal that in
generic features, HTs and MTs exhibit significant differences in conjunction
word distributions and the ratio of 1-word-gram-YiYang, while NMTs and LLMs
show significant variation in descriptive words usage and adverb ratios.
Regarding CTT-specific features, LLMs outperform NMTs in distribution, aligning
more closely with HTs in stylistic characteristics, demonstrating the potential
of LLMs in CLT.

Result: NMT和LLM输出均存在MTese，与原中文文本区分度高。LLM词汇多样性更高，NMT更多使用括号。翻译专用LLM词汇多样性较低但因果连词使用更多。

Conclusion: 机器翻译输出存在独特的语言特征，不同系统间表现差异明显，但中外LLM无显著差异。

Abstract: This study explores Machine Translationese (MTese) -- the linguistic
peculiarities of machine translation outputs -- focusing on the
under-researched English-to-Chinese language pair in news texts. We construct a
large dataset consisting of 4 sub-corpora and employ a comprehensive five-layer
feature set. Then, a chi-square ranking algorithm is applied for feature
selection in both classification and clustering tasks. Our findings confirm the
presence of MTese in both Neural Machine Translation systems (NMTs) and Large
Language Models (LLMs). Original Chinese texts are nearly perfectly
distinguishable from both LLM and NMT outputs. Notable linguistic patterns in
MT outputs are shorter sentence lengths and increased use of adversative
conjunctions. Comparing LLMs and NMTs, we achieve approximately 70%
classification accuracy, with LLMs exhibiting greater lexical diversity and
NMTs using more brackets. Additionally, translation-specific LLMs show lower
lexical diversity but higher usage of causal conjunctions compared to generic
LLMs. Lastly, we find no significant differences between LLMs developed by
Chinese firms and their foreign counterparts.

Conclusion: 论文为LLM的稳健推理研究提供了新方法和基准，推动了自校正能力的进一步探索。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
advanced complex reasoning capabilities, particularly through extended
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that incorporates mechanisms such as
backtracking, self-reflection and self-correction. Despite these developments,
the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain
underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models
often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically
show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence
on the final prediction - errors introduced at this stage can substantially
degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed
across two state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model families: DeepSeek-R1
and Qwen3. To address this, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that
leverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning
steps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in
inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we introduce a new
benchmark specifically constructed with deliberately flawed first reasoning
steps to systematically evaluate model self-correction capabilities, offering a
foundation for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了数字平台的社交语言动态，深化了对在线空间中语言如何反映意识形态和社会结构的理解。

Abstract: Language is a fundamental aspect of human societies, continuously evolving in
response to various stimuli, including societal changes and intercultural
interactions. Technological advancements have profoundly transformed
communication, with social media emerging as a pivotal force that merges
entertainment-driven content with complex social dynamics. As these platforms
reshape public discourse, analyzing the linguistic features of user-generated
content is essential to understanding their broader societal impact. In this
paper, we examine the linguistic complexity of content produced by influential
users on Twitter across three globally significant and contested topics:
COVID-19, COP26, and the Russia-Ukraine war. By combining multiple measures of
textual complexity, we assess how language use varies along four key
dimensions: account type, political leaning, content reliability, and
sentiment. Our analysis reveals significant differences across all four axes,
including variations in language complexity between individuals and
organizations, between profiles with sided versus moderate political views, and
between those associated with higher versus lower reliability scores.
Additionally, profiles producing more negative and offensive content tend to
use more complex language, with users sharing similar political stances and
reliability levels converging toward a common jargon. Our findings offer new
insights into the sociolinguistic dynamics of digital platforms and contribute
to a deeper understanding of how language reflects ideological and social
structures in online spaces.

Conclusion: GPT-2 Small中的主谓一致功能由特定子网络实现，简单任务高效，复杂任务需扩展。

Abstract: I implement a procedure to isolate and interpret the sub-network (or
"circuit") responsible for subject-verb agreement in GPT-2 Small. In this
study, the model is given prompts where the subject is either singular (e.g.
"Alice") or plural (e.g. "Alice and Bob"), and the task is to correctly predict
the appropriate verb form ("walks" for singular subjects, "walk" for plural
subjects). Using a series of techniques-including performance verification
automatic circuit discovery via direct path patching, and direct logit
attribution- I isolate a candidate circuit that contributes significantly to
the model's correct verb conjugation. The results suggest that only a small
fraction of the network's component-token pairs is needed to achieve near-model
performance on the base task but substantially more for more complex settings.

Method: 通过三步数据整理流程构建数据集，利用IPC代码进行领域标注，包含正向/反向引用和随机负样本。

Result: 数据集包含49,869个评估对，基线实验显示跨领域专利检索存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: DAPFAM是一个公开可用的数据集，支持资源有限的实体进行子文档级检索实验。

Abstract: In the landscape of publicly available patent retrieval datasets, the need
for explicit indomain and out-of-domain labeling, multi-jurisdiction coverage,
balanced query domain representation and manageable sizes that support sub
document level experiments on moderate computational resources is often
overlooked. To address these gaps, we propose DAPFAM, a new open access
domain-aware patent retrieval dataset constructed at the simple-family level.
The dataset contains 1,247 domain balanced full text query families and 45,336
full text target families. The dataset is enriched by clear relevance judgments
(forward/backward citations as positive links, random negatives), as well as
explicit in-domain or out-of-domain relationships via a novel proposed
labelling scheme based on via International Patent Classification (IPC) codes,
resulting in 49,869 evaluation pairs. The dataset is multi jurisdictional,
requires little to no preprocessing for retrieval evaluation, and remains of a
size manageable for entities with limited ressources allowing for sub document
level retrieval experiments without excessive computational costs. We describe
our three-step data-curation pipeline, present comprehensive dataset
statistics, and provide baseline experiments using lexical and neural retrieval
methods. Our baseline experiments highlight significant challenges in
crossdomain patent retrieval. The dataset will be publicly available (for now
the access link is this repository:

### [92] [SAGE: Spliced-Audio Generated Data for Enhancing Foundational Models in Low-Resource Arabic-English Code-Switched Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22143)
*Muhammad Umar Farooq,Oscar Saz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多种语音自监督学习（SSL）模型在方言阿拉伯语（DA）和阿拉伯语-英语语码转换（CS）语音上的性能，提出了一种改进的音频拼接方法生成人工CS数据，并通过微调显著降低了词错误率（WER）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决方言阿拉伯语和阿拉伯语-英语语码转换语音数据稀缺的问题，并提升模型在这些任务上的性能。

Method: 提出Spliced-Audio Generated（SAGE）数据生成方法，结合Experience Replay（ER）增强泛化能力，并集成外部语言模型优化结果。

Result: WER在阿拉伯语和英语CS基准上绝对降低了7.8%，整体平均WER从31.7%降至26.6%，在CS基准上进一步降低4.9%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在性能上超越了大规模多语言模型，展示了在数据稀缺任务中的有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of various speech SSL models on
dialectal Arabic (DA) and Arabic-English code-switched (CS) speech. To address
data scarcity, a modified audio-splicing approach is introduced to generate
artificial CS speech data. Fine-tuning an already fine-tuned SSL model with the
proposed Spliced-Audio Generated (SAGE) data results in an absolute improvement
on Word Error Rate (WER) of 7.8% on Arabic and English CS benchmarks.
Additionally, an Experience Replay (ER) inspired approach is proposed to
enhance generalisation across DA and CS speech while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting. Integrating an out-of-domain 3-gram language model reduces the
overall mean WER from 31.7% to 26.6%. Few-shot fine-tuning for code-switching
benchmarks further improves WER by 4.9%. A WER of 31.1% on Arabic-English CS
benchmarks surpasses large-scale multilingual models, including USM and
Whisper-large-v2 (both over ten times larger) by an absolute margin of 5.5% and
8.4%, respectively.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RCO的框架，通过优化批评模型来提升语言模型的反馈和修正能力，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索哪种批评类型对改进模型响应最有效，以及如何生成这类批评。

Method: 引入RCO框架，利用细化信号训练批评模型，通过反馈循环和批评效用（CU）量化批评效果。

Result: 在五个任务中，RCO在批评质量和细化结果上显著优于传统方法和开源模型。

Conclusion: RCO通过优化批评模型，有效提升了语言模型的批评-细化循环，无需直接评估批评偏好。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable evaluation and
critique capabilities, providing insightful feedback and identifying flaws in
various tasks. However, limited research has explored which types of critiques
are most effective for improving model responses or how to generate such
critiques. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{R}efinement-oriented
\textbf{C}ritique \textbf{O}ptimization (RCO), a novel framework designed to
train critic models using refinement signals. RCO uses a feedback loop where
critiques, generated by the critic model, guide the actor model in refining its
responses. The critique utility (CU) quantifies the effectiveness of these
refinements, serving as the reward signal for training the critic model. By
focusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need
for direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving
meaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks, i.e.,
dialog generation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning,
and code generation, and show that it significantly outperforms traditional
methods and open-source models in terms of critique quality and refinement
outcomes. Our contributions include the introduction of RCO, a novel
supervision scheme based on refined response preferences, and comprehensive
experimental results that highlight the method's effectiveness in enhancing LLM
critique-refinement loops.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的探测任务QM，利用人类调查数据作为上下文示例，提高了基于问题的偏见评估的稳定性，并发现指令调整可以改变偏见方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估LLMs政治偏见时稳定性不足，需改进。

Method: 提出QM任务，使用人类调查数据作为上下文示例，比较指令调整模型与基础版本。

Result: QM提高了评估稳定性，指令调整可改变偏见方向，大模型能更有效利用上下文示例且偏见较小。

Conclusion: QM是一种更稳定的偏见评估方法，指令调整和大模型对偏见有显著影响。

Abstract: A growing body of work has been querying LLMs with political questions to
evaluate their potential biases. However, this probing method has limited
stability, making comparisons between models unreliable. In this paper, we
argue that LLMs need more context. We propose a new probing task, Questionnaire
Modeling (QM), that uses human survey data as in-context examples. We show that
QM improves the stability of question-based bias evaluation, and demonstrate
that it may be used to compare instruction-tuned models to their base versions.
Experiments with LLMs of various sizes indicate that instruction tuning can
indeed change the direction of bias. Furthermore, we observe a trend that
larger models are able to leverage in-context examples more effectively, and
generally exhibit smaller bias scores in QM. Data and code are publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用GPT-4o检测结构化数据中个人数据的新方法，结合上下文信息，显著优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在检测个人数据时缺乏上下文信息的问题，提升检测准确性。

Method: 利用GPT-4o结合特征名称、值、其他特征名称及数据集描述等上下文信息进行检测。

Result: 在真实数据集MIMIC-Demo-Ext和Kaggle、OpenML数据集上表现优异，显著优于CASSED和Presidio。

Conclusion: 未来研究需更多包含个人信息的真实数据集以推动领域发展。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for detecting personal data in structured
datasets, leveraging GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art Large Language Model. A key
innovation of our method is the incorporation of contextual information: in
addition to a feature's name and values, we utilize information from other
feature names within the dataset as well as the dataset description. We compare
our approach to alternative methods, including Microsoft Presidio and CASSED,
evaluating them on multiple datasets: DeSSI, a large synthetic dataset,
datasets we collected from Kaggle and OpenML as well as MIMIC-Demo-Ext, a
real-world dataset containing patient information from critical care units.
  Our findings reveal that detection performance varies significantly depending
on the dataset used for evaluation. CASSED excels on DeSSI, the dataset on
which it was trained. Performance on the medical dataset MIMIC-Demo-Ext is
comparable across all models, with our GPT-4o-based approach clearly
outperforming the others. Notably, personal data detection in the Kaggle and
OpenML datasets appears to benefit from contextual information. This is
evidenced by the poor performance of CASSED and Presidio (both of which do not
utilize the context of the dataset) compared to the strong results of our
GPT-4o-based approach.
  We conclude that further progress in this field would greatly benefit from
the availability of more real-world datasets containing personal information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM作为评估者（LLM-as-a-Judge）在评分任务中的偏见问题，提出了一个评估框架，并通过实验揭示了现有评估模型的评分稳定性受偏见影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估者在复杂任务中广泛应用，但其评分偏见影响了公平性和可靠性，目前对评分偏见的系统性研究较少。

Method: 通过数据合成扩展现有基准，设计多维度评估指标，定义评分偏见并构建评估框架。

Result: 实验表明现有评估模型的评分稳定性受偏见干扰，探索性实验为评分提示模板设计和偏见缓解提供了见解。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM-as-a-Judge的评分偏见问题，为未来设计更公平的评估方法提供了方向。

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) gives rise
to``LLM-as-a-Judge'', where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks.
Moreover, it has been widely adopted across fields such as Natural Language
Processing (NLP), preference learning, and various specific domains. However,
there are various biases within LLM-as-a-Judge, which adversely affect the
fairness and reliability of judgments. Current research on evaluating or
mitigating bias in LLM-as-a-Judge predominantly focuses on comparison-based
evaluations, while systematic investigations into bias in scoring-based
evaluations remain limited. Therefore, we define scoring bias in LLM-as-a-Judge
as the scores differ when scoring judge models are bias-related perturbed, and
provide a well-designed framework to comprehensively evaluate scoring bias. We
augment existing LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks through data synthesis to construct
our evaluation dataset and design multi-faceted evaluation metrics. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the scoring stability of existing judge
models is disrupted by scoring biases. Further exploratory experiments and
discussions provide valuable insights into the design of scoring prompt
templates and the mitigation of scoring biases on aspects such as score
rubrics, score IDs, and reference answer selection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了人类语言理解中随机解析策略的局限性，并通过实验验证了复杂输入和意外性因素对解析策略的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类语言解析策略并非随机，但此前研究发现随机策略在简单任务中也能实现高准确率。研究旨在验证在复杂输入和意外性因素下，随机策略是否仍有效。

Method: 通过引入具有层次结构的复杂输入和意外性相关目标函数，评估随机解析策略的通信准确性。

Result: 实验结果表明，在复杂输入和意外性因素下，随机解析策略的准确性显著降低。

Conclusion: 人类语言解析策略的高效性依赖于对复杂结构和意外性因素的适应，而非随机性。

Abstract: If humans understood language by randomly selecting parsing actions, it might
have been necessary to construct a robust symbolic system capable of being
interpreted under any hierarchical structure. However, human parsing strategies
do not seem to follow such a random pattern. Why is that the case? In fact, a
previous study on emergent communication using models with hierarchical biases
have reported that agents adopting random parsing
strategies$\unicode{x2013}$ones that deviate significantly from human language
comprehension$\unicode{x2013}$can achieve high communication accuracy. In this
study, we investigate this issue by making two simple and natural modifications
to the experimental setup: (I) we use more complex inputs that have
hierarchical structures, such that random parsing makes semantic interpretation
more difficult, and (II) we incorporate a surprisal-related term, which is
known to influence the order of words and characters in natural language, into
the objective function. With these changes, we evaluate whether agents
employing random parsing strategies still maintain high communication accuracy.

TL;DR: QuickSilver是一个模块化的推理优化框架，通过动态令牌停止、KV缓存跳过和上下文令牌融合等机制，显著减少大型语言模型的推理延迟和能耗，无需修改模型权重或结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的推理过程占用了大部分延迟和能耗，现有优化方法通常需要重新训练或架构调整，限制了其适用性。

Method: QuickSilver通过动态令牌停止、KV缓存跳过和上下文令牌融合三种机制，在推理时实现语义自适应，无需改变模型权重或结构。

Result: 在GPT-2和Llama-2上测试，QuickSilver实现了高达39.6%的FLOP减少，且困惑度增加可忽略（<=0.2）。

Conclusion: QuickSilver为LLM推理优化提供了一种高效、兼容性强的解决方案，适用于冻结的密集模型。

Abstract: Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in
large language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost.
While training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime
optimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive
decoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits,
and speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or
disrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,
token-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time
without altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four
synergistic mechanisms:
  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged
representations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory
writes to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which
collapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.
  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on
frozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and
Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP
reduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).

Abstract: We present a grammar error correction (GEC) system that achieves state of the
art for the Czech language. Our system is based on a neural network translation

real-time synthetic generation pipeline, which dynamically augments sentences
with artificial errors by introducing both language-agnostic and Czech-specific
errors. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, investigating the
Czech GEC corpora as bases for synthetic error introduction, several error
generation strategies, domain balancing, tokenization granularity, model size,
and data scaling during fine-tuning. Additionally, we evaluate the performance
of large language models (LLMs) on Czech GEC in both end-user and expert
fine-tuning scenarios. Our best-performing model is superior both in
performance and computational efficiency. The source code and the trained model

Motivation: 开发一个专注于推理、支持韩语和英语的大语言模型，以推动韩国AI创新并为全球研究社区提供资源。

Method: 采用Peri-LN Transformer架构，通过三阶段课程学习扩展上下文窗口至128K tokens，并结合监督微调和强化学习进行后训练。

Conclusion: HyperCLOVA X THINK是一个强大的基础模型，适合韩国AI创新和全球研究社区使用。

Abstract: We introduce HyperCLOVA X THINK, the first reasoning-focused large language
model in the HyperCLOVA X family, pre-trained on roughly $6$ trillion
high-quality Korean, and English tokens, augmented with targeted synthetic
Korean data. It was implemented as a compute-memory-balanced Peri-LN
Transformer scaled with $\mu$P, pre-trained through a three-stage curriculum
that expands the context window to $128$K tokens, and post-trained via
supervised fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards
supports both detailed rationale and concise-answer modes. It delivers
competitive performance against similarly sized models on Korea-focused
benchmarks such as KMMLU, CSAT, KoBALT-700, HAERAE-1.0, and KoBigBench, while
preserving robust bilingual consistency and translation quality. In addition, a
vision-augmented variant matches or exceeds GPT-4.1 on the KCSAT STEM
benchmark, all of which are achieved with substantially lower training compute
than existing models of similar sizes. We also present a pruning and
distillation technique that will soon be applied to HyperCLOVA X THINK for an
open-source and business-friendly foundation model. Altogether, these
capabilities position HyperCLOVA X THINK as a robust foundation for Korean AI
innovation and a valuable resource for the global research community.

Motivation: 现有语言模型评估未能反映真实临床诊断的复杂性和迭代性，需要更贴近实际的评估方法。

Method: 将304个NEJM-CPC案例转化为逐步诊断任务，开发了MAI-DxO模型，模拟医生团队并提出高效测试策略。

Result: MAI-DxO与OpenAI o3模型结合，诊断准确率达80%，成本降低20%，优于普通医生和现成模型。

Conclusion: AI系统通过迭代思考和高效行动，可显著提升临床诊断的精确性和成本效益。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds great promise for expanding access to expert
medical knowledge and reasoning. However, most evaluations of language models
rely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the
complexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In
clinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic
hypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just
learned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final
diagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential
Diagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New
England Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases
into stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case
abstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper
model that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is
assessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician
visits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator
(MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians,
proposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value,
cost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%
diagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist
physicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to
physicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum
accuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO
generalize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and
Llama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively
and act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in
clinical care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在细粒度空间推理和多步逻辑对齐方面表现不足。

Method: 采用M3CTS生成多样化逻辑一致的LongCoT轨迹，提出fDPO优化方法，结合空间奖励机制。

Result: fDPO在空间质量任务上平均提升4.1%，数量任务提升9.0%；SpatialReasoner-R1在SPATIALRGPT-Bench上达到新SoTA。

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner-R1通过创新方法显著提升了空间推理能力，同时保持通用任务的竞争力。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with fine-grained spatial
reasoning, particularly when multi-step logic and precise spatial alignment are
required. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language
reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct
high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte
Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent
Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose
fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces
segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical
reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate
responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical
coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average
improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0%
gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a
new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in
average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general
vision-language tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成模型在全景图像生成中面临几何失真和一致性不足的问题，需要一种更高效且全局一致的方法。

Method: TanDiT使用统一的扩散模型在单次去噪迭代中生成切平面图像，并提出模型无关的后处理步骤增强全局一致性。

Result: 实验表明，TanDiT能有效泛化、处理复杂文本提示，并与多种生成模型结合生成高质量全景图像。

Conclusion: TanDiT为全景图像生成提供了高效且一致的解决方案，并通过新指标和基准推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to remarkable improvements in
synthesizing perspective images. However, these models still struggle with
panoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels
of geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To
address these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we
introduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating
grids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\circ$ view. Unlike
previous methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a
unified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images
simultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a
model-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global
coherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image
quality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and
provide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and
standardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets
detailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various
generative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的视觉裁剪方法FOCUS，利用MLLM内部表示指导搜索最相关图像区域，显著提升细粒度VQA任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉裁剪方法需要任务特定微调、效率低或与高效注意力实现不兼容的问题。

Method: 通过四步实现：识别目标对象、计算对象相关性图、提出并排序相关图像区域、使用排名最高区域进行细粒度VQA。

Result: 在四个细粒度VQA数据集和两种MLLM上表现优异，优于三种流行视觉裁剪方法，计算量减少3-6.5倍。

Conclusion: FOCUS是一种高效且无需训练的视觉裁剪方法，显著提升细粒度VQA任务的性能。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong perception and
reasoning capabilities for image-text input, Visual Question Answering (VQA)
focusing on small image details still remains a challenge. Although visual
cropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:
the need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed
exhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.
We address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping
method, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the
search for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:
first, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute
an object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and
rank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the
fine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed
search strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA
datasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping
methods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing
baseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CAST的统一模型，利用交叉注意力机制融合时空特征，显著提升了深度伪造视频检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字媒体真实性构成威胁，现有CNN-Transformer模型在时空特征融合上存在局限性，需要更高效的检测方法。

Method: 提出CAST模型，通过交叉注意力动态融合时空特征，增强对细微时间演化伪造痕迹的检测能力。

Result: 在FaceForensics++、Celeb-DF和DeepfakeDetection数据集上表现优异，AUC达99.49%，准确率97.57%，跨数据集测试AUC为93.31%。

Conclusion: 交叉注意力机制显著提升了深度伪造检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Deepfakes have emerged as a significant threat to digital media authenticity,
increasing the need for advanced detection techniques that can identify subtle
and time-dependent manipulations. CNNs are effective at capturing spatial
artifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies.
However, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal
features independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use
separate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine
them using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which
limits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we
propose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse
spatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows
temporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing
the model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as
flickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization
and deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across
diverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model
using the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both
intra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach.
Our model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an
accuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations. In cross-dataset
testing, it demonstrates impressive generalization by achieving a 93.31 percent
AUC on the unseen DeepfakeDetection dataset. These results highlight the
effectiveness of cross-attention-based feature fusion in enhancing the
robustness of deepfake video detection.

### [106] [Elucidating and Endowing the Diffusion Training Paradigm for General Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21722)
*Xin Lu,Xueyang Fu,Jie Xiao,Zihao Fan,Yurui Zhu,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将扩散训练范式融入普通图像恢复（IR）框架的方法，通过系统分析时间步依赖、网络层次等关键因素，提升了单任务和多任务IR的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像恢复任务中表现出强大的生成能力，但其复杂架构和迭代过程限制了实际应用。现有方法忽视了将扩散训练范式融入普通IR框架的可能性。

Method: 通过分析时间步依赖、网络层次等因素，提出新的IR框架，并引入正则化策略和对齐扩散目标与IR任务的方法。针对多任务IR，开发增量训练范式和任务特定适配器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了单任务IR的泛化能力，并在多任务统一IR中表现优异。

Conclusion: 所提框架可无缝集成到现有普通IR架构中，为扩散训练范式在IR任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: While diffusion models demonstrate strong generative capabilities in image
restoration (IR) tasks, their complex architectures and iterative processes
limit their practical application compared to mainstream reconstruction-based
general ordinary IR networks. Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing
network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the
diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address
these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the
diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis
of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and
multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by
diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore
images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of
regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks,
improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing
that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR
tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors,
further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in
single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR.
Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing
general IR architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AsymDSD的自监督学习框架，通过潜在空间预测结合掩码建模和不变性学习，显著提升了3D点云语义表示的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督3D点云学习中缺乏大规模标注数据集的问题，同时改进传统掩码点建模（MPM）在捕获高层次语义上的局限性。

Method: 采用非对称双自蒸馏框架（AsymDSD），结合潜在空间预测、多掩码采样和多裁剪技术，避免形状泄漏并提升效率。

Result: 在ScanObjectNN上达到90.53%的准确率，预训练后进一步提升至93.72%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AsymDSD通过创新设计显著提升了3D点云语义表示的性能，为自监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning semantically meaningful representations from unstructured 3D point
clouds remains a central challenge in computer vision, especially in the
absence of large-scale labeled datasets. While masked point modeling (MPM) is
widely used in self-supervised 3D learning, its reconstruction-based objective
can limit its ability to capture high-level semantics. We propose AsymDSD, an
Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation framework that unifies masked modeling and
invariance learning through prediction in the latent space rather than the
input space. AsymDSD builds on a joint embedding architecture and introduces
several key design choices: an efficient asymmetric setup, disabling attention
between masked queries to prevent shape leakage, multi-mask sampling, and a
point cloud adaptation of multi-crop. AsymDSD achieves state-of-the-art results
on ScanObjectNN (90.53%) and further improves to 93.72% when pretrained on 930k
shapes, surpassing prior methods.

### [108] [Exploring Image Generation via Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces and Local Correlation Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21731)
*Chenqiu Zhao,Anup Basu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了两个理论框架MESP和LCH，探讨概率生成模型的局限性，即全局分布学习导致记忆而非生成行为。MESP源于对VAE的重新思考，提出了基于重叠系数的下界，并设计了BL-AE和ARVM模型。LCH假设生成能力源于局部相关性。实验验证了框架的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索概率生成模型的潜在局限性，即全局分布学习可能导致记忆而非真正的生成行为。

Method: 提出MESP框架，重新思考VAE的潜在变量分布重叠问题，设计BL-AE和ARVM模型；提出LCH假设，强调局部相关性对生成能力的重要性。

Result: ARVM在标准数据集上取得竞争性FID分数，但发现这些分数反映的是记忆而非生成行为。

Conclusion: MESP和LCH框架揭示了概率生成模型的局限性，并提出了改进方向，即关注局部相关性以提高生成能力。

Abstract: We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability
Space (MESP) and the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), to explore a potential
limitation in probabilistic generative models; namely that learning global
distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. MESP
emerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe
that latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an
optimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A
lower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this
phenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary
Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent
representations. These binary latents are used as the input to our
Autoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model
outputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect
memorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the
Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability
arising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive
experiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is enabling collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing sensitive patient data. This approach is
particularly valuable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where access
to trained medical professionals is limited. However, FL adoption in LMICs
faces significant barriers, including limited high-performance computing
resources and unreliable internet connectivity. To address these challenges, we
introduce FedNCA, a novel FL system tailored for medical image segmentation
tasks. FedNCA leverages the lightweight Med-NCA architecture, enabling training
on low-cost edge devices, such as widely available smartphones, while
minimizing communication costs. Additionally, our encryption-ready FedNCA
proves to be suitable for compromised network communication. By overcoming
infrastructural and security challenges, FedNCA paves the way for inclusive,
efficient, lightweight, and encryption-ready medical imaging solutions,
fostering equitable healthcare advancements in resource-constrained regions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了ImplicitQA基准，旨在测试视频问答模型在隐含推理上的能力，填补了现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频问答基准主要关注显性视觉内容，而忽略了隐含推理（如动机、因果关系等），人类擅长此类推理，但现有系统无法捕捉。

Method: 构建了包含1K QA对的ImplicitQA基准，涵盖多种推理维度，并评估了领先的视频问答模型。

Result: 评估显示现有模型在隐含推理任务上表现不佳，依赖表面视觉线索。

Conclusion: ImplicitQA为社区提供了新挑战，促进隐含推理研究。

Abstract: Video QA has made significant strides by leveraging multimodal learning to
align visual and textual modalities. However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly
focus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions,
objects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips.
In contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and
narrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately
omit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and
relationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such
implicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context
to construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail
to capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this
gap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test
models on implicit reasoning. It comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs
derived from 320+ high-quality creative video clips, systematically categorized
into key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth
and proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and
motivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred
counting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors
ensuring high-quality. Our extensive evaluations on leading VideoQA models
reveals performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level
visual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning. Performance
variations across models further illustrate the complexity and diversity of the
challenges presented by ImplicitQA. By releasing both the dataset and our data
collection framework, we aim to stimulate further research and development in
the community. https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucf-crcv/ImplicitQA.

Result: 实验表明，简单预处理比复杂增强方法具有更高的AUC-ROC，模型在未见数据集上表现出强判别性能。

Conclusion: 该流程为青光眼早期检测提供了可重复且可扩展的方法，具有潜在的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, but early detection
can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods
are often invasive and require specialized equipment. In this work, we present
a deep learning pipeline using the EfficientNet-B0 architecture for glaucoma
detection from retinal fundus images. Unlike prior studies that rely on single
datasets, we sequentially train and fine-tune our model across ACRIMA, ORIGA,
and RIM-ONE datasets to enhance generalization. Our experiments show that
minimal preprocessing yields higher AUC-ROC compared to more complex
enhancements, and our model demonstrates strong discriminative performance on
unseen datasets. The proposed pipeline offers a reproducible and scalable
approach to early glaucoma detection, supporting its potential clinical
utility.

Result: 现有模型在自我中心视频中表现较差，GPT-4o优于专用模型。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究以提升自我中心视频处理能力，提示微调方法潜力显著。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate various computer vision paradigms - supervised
learning, unsupervised learning, and prompt fine-tuning - by assessing their
ability to understand and interpret egocentric video data. Specifically, we
examine Shotluck Holmes (state-of-the-art supervised learning), TAC-SUM
(state-of-the-art unsupervised learning), and GPT-4o (a prompt fine-tuned
pre-trained model), evaluating their effectiveness in video summarization. Our
results demonstrate that current state-of-the-art models perform less
effectively on first-person videos compared to third-person videos,
highlighting the need for further advancements in the egocentric video domain.
Notably, a prompt fine-tuned general-purpose GPT-4o model outperforms these
specialized models, emphasizing the limitations of existing approaches in
adapting to the unique challenges of first-person perspectives. Although our
evaluation is conducted on a small subset of egocentric videos from the
Ego-Exo4D dataset due to resource constraints, the primary objective of this
research is to provide a comprehensive proof-of-concept analysis aimed at
advancing the application of computer vision techniques to first-person videos.
By exploring novel methodologies and evaluating their potential, we aim to
contribute to the ongoing development of models capable of effectively

Motivation: 现有数据集仅关注手术分析的孤立方面（如工具检测或阶段分割），缺乏对实体间语义关系的全面表示。

Method: 提出CAT-SG数据集，包含工具-组织交互、程序变化和时间依赖的标注，并开发CatSGG模型生成结构化手术表示。

Result: CatSGG模型在生成结构化手术表示方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CAT-SG数据集和CatSGG模型为AI驱动的临床实践（如手术培训和实时决策支持）提供了更智能的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding the intricate workflows of cataract surgery requires modeling
complex interactions between surgical tools, anatomical structures, and
procedural techniques. Existing datasets primarily address isolated aspects of
surgical analysis, such as tool detection or phase segmentation, but lack
comprehensive representations that capture the semantic relationships between
entities over time. This paper introduces the Cataract Surgery Scene Graph
(CAT-SG) dataset, the first to provide structured annotations of tool-tissue
interactions, procedural variations, and temporal dependencies. By
incorporating detailed semantic relations, CAT-SG offers a holistic view of
surgical workflows, enabling more accurate recognition of surgical phases and
techniques. Additionally, we present a novel scene graph generation model,
CatSGG, which outperforms current methods in generating structured surgical
representations. The CAT-SG dataset is designed to enhance AI-driven surgical
training, real-time decision support, and workflow analysis, paving the way for
more intelligent, context-aware systems in clinical practice.

Result: 在Siegfried数据集上，10-shot和5-shot场景下分别取得5%和13%的相对mIoU提升；在ICDAR 2021数据集上，建筑块分割的PQ达到67.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法在极低数据量下仍保持高性能，大幅减少人工标注需求，推动了历史地图的自动化处理与分析。

Abstract: As rich sources of history, maps provide crucial insights into historical
changes, yet their diverse visual representations and limited annotated data
pose significant challenges for automated processing. We propose a simple yet
effective approach for few-shot segmentation of historical maps, leveraging the
rich semantic embeddings of large vision foundation models combined with
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on
the Siegfried benchmark dataset in vineyard and railway segmentation, achieving
+5% and +13% relative improvements in mIoU in 10-shot scenarios and around +20%
in the more challenging 5-shot setting. Additionally, it demonstrates strong
performance on the ICDAR 2021 competition dataset, attaining a mean PQ of 67.3%
for building block segmentation, despite not being optimized for this
shape-sensitive metric, underscoring its generalizability. Notably, our
approach maintains high performance even in extremely low-data regimes (10- &
5-shot), while requiring only 689k trainable parameters - just 0.21% of the
total model size. Our approach enables precise segmentation of diverse
historical maps while drastically reducing the need for manual annotations,
advancing automated processing and analysis in the field. Our implementation is

Abstract: Storytelling is a deeply personal and creative process, yet existing methods
often treat users as passive consumers, offering generic plots with limited
personalization. This undermines engagement and immersion, especially where
individual style or appearance is crucial. We introduce TaleForge, a
personalized story-generation system that integrates large language models
(LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion to embed users' facial images within both
narratives and illustrations. TaleForge features three interconnected modules:
Story Generation, where LLMs create narratives and character descriptions from
user prompts; Personalized Image Generation, merging users' faces and outfit
choices into character illustrations; and Background Generation, creating scene
backdrops that incorporate personalized characters. A user study demonstrated
heightened engagement and ownership when individuals appeared as protagonists.

Result: 在多项领域用户研究中，PrefPaint表现优于现有方法，尤其在医学图像中生成更真实的息肉图像。

Conclusion: PrefPaint通过人类反馈和交互界面显著提升医学图像修复的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Inpainting, the process of filling missing or corrupted image parts, has
broad applications, including medical imaging. However, in specialized fields
like medical polyps imaging, where accuracy and reliability are critical,
inpainting models can generate inaccurate images, leading to significant errors
in medical diagnosis and treatment. To ensure reliability, medical images
should be annotated by experts like oncologists for effective model training.
We propose PrefPaint, an approach that incorporates human feedback into the
training process of Stable Diffusion Inpainting, bypassing the need for
computationally expensive reward models. In addition, we develop a web-based
interface streamlines training, fine-tuning, and inference. This interactive
interface provides a smooth and intuitive user experience, making it easier to
offer feedback and manage the fine-tuning process. User study on various
domains shows that PrefPaint outperforms existing methods, reducing visual
inconsistencies and improving image rendering, particularly in medical
contexts, where our model generates more realistic polyps images.

Motivation: 现有SAM方法在视觉参考分割中因提示编码器不理想，常在物体边界生成不稳定提示，导致鲁棒性下降。

Method: 提出ProSAM，通过学习变分提示编码器预测多变量提示分布，避免在不稳定区域生成提示。

Result: 在Pascal-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProSAM为视觉参考分割提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent advancements in large foundation models have driven the success of
open-set image segmentation, a task focused on segmenting objects beyond
predefined categories. Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes,
texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its
unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several
SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically
generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts
at object boundaries due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in
instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple
but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in
existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a
variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM
avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the
instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets,
providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.

While base image models struggle with spatial relationships and affordance
reasoning, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes this
task into structured stages: functional design, symbolic scene graph reasoning,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅将EEG数据转换为2D图像，忽略了3D空间信息的重建，限制了BCI的实际应用。

Conclusion: 该方法为从EEG数据重建3D视觉刺激提供了新思路，扩展了BCI的应用潜力。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D visual stimuli from Electroencephalography (EEG) data holds
significant potential for applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and
aiding individuals with communication disorders. Traditionally, efforts have
focused on converting brain activity into 2D images, neglecting the translation
of EEG data into 3D objects. This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain
inherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of
whether observing 2D images or the real world. The neural activities captured
by EEG contain rich spatial information that is inevitably lost when
reconstructing only 2D images, thus limiting its practical applications in BCI.
The transition from EEG data to 3D object reconstruction faces considerable
obstacles. These include the presence of extensive noise within EEG signals and
a scarcity of datasets that include both EEG and 3D information, which
complicates the extraction process of 3D visual data. Addressing this
challenging task, we propose an innovative EEG encoder architecture that
integrates a dual self-attention mechanism. We use a hybrid training strategy
to train the EEG Encoder, which includes cross-attention, contrastive learning,
and self-supervised learning techniques. Additionally, by employing stable
diffusion as a prior distribution and utilizing Variational Score Distillation
to train a neural radiation field, we successfully generate 3D objects with
similar content and structure from EEG data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于RGB-IR图像对的联合压缩框架，通过跨模态熵模型（CCEM）提升压缩效率，实验表明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态数据（如RGB-IR）应用的增加，存储和传输成本成倍增长，因此需要高效的压缩方法。

Method: 设计了通道式跨模态熵模型（CCEM），包含低频上下文提取块（LCEB）和低频上下文融合块（LCFB），以利用跨模态信息优化熵参数预测。

Result: 在LLVIP和KAIST数据集上，提出的方法优于现有RGB-IR和单模态压缩方法，例如在LLVIP上比特率节省23.1%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过跨模态信息建模显著提升了RGB-IR图像对的压缩效率。

Abstract: RGB-IR(RGB-Infrared) image pairs are frequently applied simultaneously in
various applications like intelligent surveillance. However, as the number of
modalities increases, the required data storage and transmission costs also
double. Therefore, efficient RGB-IR data compression is essential. This work
proposes a joint compression framework for RGB-IR image pair. Specifically, to
fully utilize cross-modality prior information for accurate context probability
modeling within and between modalities, we propose a Channel-wise
Cross-modality Entropy Model (CCEM). Among CCEM, a Low-frequency Context
Extraction Block (LCEB) and a Low-frequency Context Fusion Block (LCFB) are
designed for extracting and aggregating the global low-frequency information
from both modalities, which assist the model in predicting entropy parameters
more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms
existing RGB-IR image pair and single-modality compression methods on LLVIP and
KAIST datasets. For instance, the proposed framework achieves a 23.1% bit rate
saving on LLVIP dataset compared to the state-of-the-art RGB-IR image codec

*Jiho Choi,Sang Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种通过自监督学习从无标签面部视频中学习周期性信号表示的方法，用于远程光电容积描记术（rPPG）估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从面部视频中捕捉周期性信号（如皮肤色调的细微变化）对rPPG任务至关重要，但现有方法在跨数据集评估中表现不佳。

Method: 使用视频掩码自编码器（MAE）学习时空表示，结合帧掩码和生理带宽限制约束。

Result: 在PURE、UBFC-rPPG、MMPD和V4V数据集上表现优异，尤其在跨数据集评估中显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督学习和生理约束有效提升了rPPG任务的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method that learns a general representation of
periodic signals from unlabeled facial videos by capturing subtle changes in
skin tone over time. The proposed framework employs the video masked
autoencoder to learn a high-dimensional spatio-temporal representation of the
facial region through self-supervised learning. Capturing quasi-periodic
signals in the video is crucial for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)
estimation. To account for signal periodicity, we apply frame masking in terms
of video sampling, which allows the model to capture resampled quasi-periodic
signals during the pre-training stage. Moreover, the framework incorporates
physiological bandlimit constraints, leveraging the property that physiological
signals are sparse within their frequency bandwidth to provide pulse cues to
the model. The pre-trained encoder is then transferred to the rPPG task, where
it is used to extract physiological signals from facial videos. We evaluate the
proposed method through extensive experiments on the PURE, UBFC-rPPG, MMPD, and
V4V datasets. Our results demonstrate significant performance improvements,
particularly in challenging cross-dataset evaluations. Our code is available at

*Ekaterina Redekop,Mara Pleasure,Zichen Wang,Kimberly Flores,Anthony Sisk,William Speier,Corey W. Arnold*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPADE是一个基础模型，整合了组织病理学和空间转录组学数据，通过对比学习在多任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全切片图像与空间转录组学数据整合的空白，以捕捉分子异质性。

Method: 采用混合数据专家技术和两阶段特征空间聚类，结合对比学习。

Result: 在14个下游任务中表现出显著优于基线模型的少样本性能。

Conclusion: 整合形态学和分子信息到一个潜在空间具有显著优势。

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep
learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various
pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches
integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the
comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial
transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular
heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce
SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide
image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an
ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique,
where experts, created via two-stage feature-space clustering, use contrastive
learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene
expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is
evaluated on 14 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot
performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of
integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

### [123] [LLaVA-Scissor: Token Compression with Semantic Connected Components for Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21862)
*Boyuan Sun,Jiaxing Zhao,Xihan Wei,Qibin Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-Scissor是一种无需训练的视频多模态大语言模型令牌压缩策略，通过语义连通组件（SCC）实现全面的语义覆盖，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于注意力分数的令牌压缩方法无法有效捕捉所有语义区域且易导致冗余，需改进。

Method: 采用SCC方法将令牌分配到不同语义区域，提出两步时空令牌压缩策略。

Result: 在多种视频理解基准测试中表现优异，尤其在低令牌保留率下。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Scissor通过SCC实现了高效的令牌压缩，适用于视频多模态任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we present LLaVA-Scissor, a training-free token compression
strategy designed for video multimodal large language models. Previous methods
mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to
effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy.
Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC)
approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set,
ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step
spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial
and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by
representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We
conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of
LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video
question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices
benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor
outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in
various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention
ratios. Project page: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/LLaVA-Scissor.

### [124] [Remote Sensing Large Vision-Language Model: Semantic-augmented Multi-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21863)
*Sungjune Park,Yeongyun Kim,Se Yeon Kim,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对遥感图像理解的新型LVLM框架，通过语义增强的多级对齐和语义感知专家建模，解决了现有LVLMs在遥感领域的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像与自然图像在视觉外观、对象尺度和语义上存在显著差异，限制了现有LVLMs的直接应用。

Method: 框架包含两个核心组件：语义增强的多级对齐模块（检索相关语义线索并聚合）和语义感知专家建模（分层处理不同级别的语义）。

Result: 在多个遥感任务（如场景分类和VQA）中表现优异，验证了其跨语义级别的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功弥合了通用LVLMs与遥感特定需求之间的差距。

Abstract: Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
various vision-language tasks in natural image domains. However, their
application to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant
domain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These
discrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain
rich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.
Hence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To
address this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS
understanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented
Multi-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align
multi-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic
Augmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics
across fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is
designed to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge
database, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and
multi-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation
across multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design
semantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic
representation at different levels separately. This enables hierarchical
semantic understanding from coarse to fine levels. Evaluations across multiple
RS tasks-including scene classification and VQA, etc.-demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves consistent improvements across multiple semantic
levels. This highlights its capability and effectiveness in bridging the gap
between general LVLMs and unique demands of RS-specific vision-language
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DPU-Former的双视角统一Transformer模型，用于光学遥感图像（ORSIs）的自动分割，结合了卷积和Transformer的优势，解决了特征异质性、高复杂性和大参数等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ORSIs分割方法通常仅基于卷积或Transformer特征，未能充分利用两者的优势，导致分割效果不佳。

Method: 设计了全局-局部混合注意力机制和傅里叶空间融合策略，并引入门控线性前馈网络和DPU-Former解码器。

Result: DPU-Former在多个数据集上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DPU-Former通过融合长程依赖和空间细节，显著提升了ORSIs分割性能。

Abstract: Automatically segmenting objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs)
is an important task. Most existing models are primarily based on either
convolutional or Transformer features, each offering distinct advantages.
Exploiting both advantages is valuable research, but it presents several
challenges, including the heterogeneity between the two types of features, high
complexity, and large parameters of the model. However, these issues are often
overlooked in existing the ORSIs methods, causing sub-optimal segmentation. For
that, we propose a novel Dual-Perspective United Transformer (DPU-Former) with
a unique structure designed to simultaneously integrate long-range dependencies
and spatial details. In particular, we design the global-local mixed attention,
which captures diverse information through two perspectives and introduces a
Fourier-space merging strategy to obviate deviations for efficient fusion.
Furthermore, we present a gated linear feed-forward network to increase the
expressive ability. Additionally, we construct a DPU-Former decoder to
aggregate and strength features at different layers. Consequently, the
DPU-Former model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

### [126] [Grounding-Aware Token Pruning: Recovering from Drastic Performance Drops in Visual Grounding Caused by Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21873)
*Tzu-Chun Chien,Chieh-Kai Lin,Shiang-Feng Tsai,Ruei-Chi Lai,Hung-Jen Chen,Min Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉定位中表现优异，但视觉标记修剪会显著降低其性能。研究发现修剪导致位置ID错位是主要原因，提出GAP方法无需额外训练即可恢复90%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉标记修剪虽能降低计算成本，但会严重削弱模型的视觉定位能力，导致性能大幅下降。

Method: 提出Grounding-Aware Token Pruning（GAP），通过调整位置ID解决修剪导致的性能下降问题。

Result: GAP方法将REC准确率从修剪后的15.34%恢复至51.42%，接近原始性能的90%。

Conclusion: GAP是一种简单有效的方法，无需额外资源即可显著提升修剪后模型的视觉定位性能。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance in visual grounding, establishing themselves as a general interface
for various vision-language applications. This progress has driven the
development of token pruning methods to mitigate the high computational costs
associated with processing numerous visual tokens. However, we observe that
pruning significantly weakens the model's grounding ability, leading to
incorrect predictions and drastic performance degradation. In Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC), for instance, pruning causes the accuracy of
LLaVA on the RefCOCO validation set to drop from 56.14% to 15.34%. Our analysis
identifies misaligned position IDs after pruning as the primary cause of this
degradation, as both the order and value of these IDs are crucial for
maintaining performance in grounding tasks. To address this issue, we propose
Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP), a simple yet effective adjustment to
position IDs that recovers REC accuracy back to 51.42%, which is 90% of the
original performance in the without pruning setting, all while requiring no
additional training, memory, or computational overhead. Applied to models such
as Shikra, MiniGPTv2, and the LLaVA series, our method consistently improves
performance across various token pruning strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度可解释性的框架，用于自动标记训练图像中的问题样本，以提高银屑病严重程度评分的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 银屑病严重程度评分在临床试验中很重要，但存在评分者间变异性和临床评估负担的问题。远程成像虽具扩展性，但引入的变量（如光照、背景）和标注不一致性降低了自动评分的可靠性。

Method: 使用基于梯度的可解释性方法，追踪误分类验证图像的梯度，检测训练样本中的不一致标注或非临床伪影。应用于基于ConvNeXT的弱监督模型。

Result: 移除8.2%的问题图像后，模型AUC-ROC提高了5%（85%至90%）。在双标注者数据中，该方法识别出90%以上不一致案例，仅需审查前30%样本。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测标注不一致的训练图像，减少人工审查需求，提升远程评估的自动评分鲁棒性。

Abstract: Psoriasis (PsO) severity scoring is important for clinical trials but is
hindered by inter-rater variability and the burden of in person clinical
evaluation. Remote imaging using patient captured mobile photos offers
scalability but introduces challenges, such as variation in lighting,
background, and device quality that are often imperceptible to humans but can
impact model performance. These factors, along with inconsistencies in
dermatologist annotations, reduce the reliability of automated severity
scoring. We propose a framework to automatically flag problematic training
images that introduce spurious correlations which degrade model generalization,
using a gradient based interpretability approach. By tracing the gradients of
misclassified validation images, we detect training samples where model errors
align with inconsistently rated examples or are affected by subtle, nonclinical
artifacts. We apply this method to a ConvNeXT based weakly supervised model
designed to classify PsO severity from phone images. Removing 8.2% of flagged
images improves model AUC-ROC by 5% (85% to 90%) on a held out test set.
Commonly, multiple annotators and an adjudication process ensure annotation
accuracy, which is expensive and time consuming. Our method detects training
images with annotation inconsistencies, potentially removing the need for
manual review. When applied to a subset of training data rated by two
dermatologists, the method identifies over 90% of cases with inter-rater
disagreement by reviewing only the top 30% of samples. This improves automated
scoring for remote assessments, ensuring robustness despite data collection
variability.

potential to enhance system adaptability and robustness. Our work offers
valuable insights into current methods and future directions for multi-sensor
fusion in autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SODA的新方法，利用3D视觉语言模型（3D VLMs）检测点云数据中的分布外（OOD）对象，解决了合成数据与真实数据之间的域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云数据在多种应用中日益普及，但检测OOD点云对象的问题尚未得到充分研究。现有3D VLMs预训练数据集规模小且多样性不足，导致合成数据与真实数据之间存在域偏移，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出SODA方法，通过基于邻域的分数传播方案改进OOD点云的检测，无需额外模型训练。

Result: SODA在多个数据集和问题设置中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SODA有效解决了合成数据与真实数据之间的域偏移问题，提升了OOD点云检测的性能。

Abstract: As point cloud data increases in prevalence in a variety of applications, the
ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) point cloud objects becomes
critical for ensuring model safety and reliability. However, this problem
remains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image
domain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs)
for OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that
point cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size
and object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they
often contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a
substantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks
involving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper,
our empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift
significantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text
embeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To
address this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the
detection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation
scheme. SODA is inference-based, requires no additional model training, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing approaches across datasets
and problem settings.

Abstract: Recently the emergence of novel presentation attacks has drawn increasing
attention to face anti-spoofing. However, existing methods tend to memorize
data patterns from the training set, resulting in poor generalization to
unknown attack types across different scenarios and limited interpretability.
To address these challenges, this paper presents a reinforcement
fine-tuning-based face anti-spoofing method that stimulates the capabilities of
multimodal large language models to think and learn how to solve the
anti-spoofing task itself, rather than relying on the memorization of
authenticity patterns. We design verifiable class consistent reward and
reasoning consistent reward, and employ a GRPO-based optimization strategy to
guide the model in exploring reasoning policies from multiple perspectives to
maximize expected rewards. As a result, through iterative trial-and-error
learning while retaining only high-reward trajectories, the model distills
highly generalizable decision-making rules from the extensive solution space to
effectively address cross-domain face anti-spoofing tasks. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
cross-domain generalization performance. It generalizes well to diverse unknown
attack types in unseen target domains while providing interpretable reasoning
for its authenticity decisions without requiring labor-intensive textual
annotations for training.

Abstract: Video is transforming education with online courses and recorded lectures
supplementing and replacing classroom teaching. Recent research has focused on
enhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation,
searchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual
elements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension,
retention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential
for improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is
that accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is
challenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs,
tables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard
structure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be
composed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep
learning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory
performance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity
of annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for
detecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art
object detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video
datasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently
YOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple
benchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy.
Results evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general
solution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos. Paper
contributions include a publicly released benchmark of annotated lecture video
frames, along with the source code to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: 本文为属性感知的文本到运动生成设定了首个基准，并通过新数据集HumanAttr验证了模型的优越性。

Abstract: Text-driven human motion generation has recently attracted considerable
attention, allowing models to generate human motions based on textual
descriptions. However, current methods neglect the influence of human
attributes (such as age, gender, weight, and height) which are key factors
shaping human motion patterns. This work represents a pilot exploration for
bridging this gap. We conceptualize each motion as comprising both attribute
information and action semantics, where textual descriptions align exclusively
with action semantics. To achieve this, a new framework inspired by Structural
Causal Models is proposed to decouple action semantics from human attributes,
enabling text-to-semantics prediction and attribute-controlled generation. The
resulting model is capable of generating realistic, attribute-aware motion
aligned with the user's text and attribute inputs. For evaluation, we introduce
HumanAttr, a comprehensive dataset containing attribute annotations for
text-motion pairs, setting the first benchmark for attribute-aware
text-to-motion generation. Extensive experiments on the new dataset validate
our model's effectiveness.

Abstract: The automated reconstruction of the logical arrangement of tables from image
data, termed Table Structure Recognition (TSR), is fundamental for semantic
data extraction. Recently, researchers have explored a wide range of techniques
to tackle this problem, demonstrating significant progress. Each table is a set
of vertical and horizontal separators. Following this realization, we present
SepFormer, which integrates the split-and-merge paradigm into a single step
through separator regression with a DETR-style architecture, improving speed
and robustness. SepFormer is a coarse-to-fine approach that predicts table
separators from single-line to line-strip separators with a stack of two
transformer decoders. In the coarse-grained stage, the model learns to
gradually refine single-line segments through decoder layers with additional
angle loss. At the end of the fine-grained stage, the model predicts line-strip
separators by refining sampled points from each single-line segment. Our
SepFormer can run on average at 25.6 FPS while achieving comparable performance
with state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including SciTSR,
PubTabNet, WTW, and iFLYTAB.

Abstract: Histological analysis plays a crucial role in understanding tissue structure
and pathology. While recent advancements in registration methods have improved
2D histological analysis, they often struggle to preserve critical 3D spatial
relationships, limiting their utility in both clinical and research
applications. Specifically, constructing accurate 3D models from 2D slices
remains challenging due to tissue deformation, sectioning artifacts,
variability in imaging techniques, and inconsistent illumination. Deep
learning-based registration methods have demonstrated improved performance but
suffer from limited generalizability and require large-scale training data. In
contrast, non-deep-learning approaches offer better generalizability but often
compromise on accuracy. In this study, we introduced ZeroReg3D, a novel
zero-shot registration pipeline tailored for accurate 3D reconstruction from
serial histological sections. By combining zero-shot deep learning-based
keypoint matching with optimization-based affine and non-rigid registration
techniques, ZeroReg3D effectively addresses critical challenges such as tissue
deformation, sectioning artifacts, staining variability, and inconsistent
illumination without requiring retraining or fine-tuning. The code has been
made publicly available at https://github.com/hrlblab/ZeroReg3D

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize target objects within a 3D scene
based on natural language queries. To alleviate the reliance on costly 3D
training data, recent studies have explored zero-shot 3DVG by leveraging the
extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and
VLMs. However, existing paradigms tend to emphasize either spatial (3D-based)
or semantic (2D-based) understanding, limiting their effectiveness in complex
real-world applications. In this work, we introduce SPAZER - a VLM-driven agent
that combines both modalities in a progressive reasoning framework. It first
holistically analyzes the scene and produces a 3D rendering from the optimal
viewpoint. Based on this, anchor-guided candidate screening is conducted to
perform a coarse-level localization of potential objects. Furthermore,
leveraging retrieved relevant 2D camera images, 3D-2D joint decision-making is
efficiently performed to determine the best-matching object. By bridging
spatial and semantic reasoning neural streams, SPAZER achieves robust zero-shot
grounding without training on 3D-labeled data. Extensive experiments on
ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate that SPAZER significantly outperforms
previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, achieving notable gains of 9.0%
and 10.9% in accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content
(AIGC) techniques, AI generated images (AIGIs) have attracted widespread
attention, among which AI generated omnidirectional images (AIGODIs) hold
significant potential for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)
applications. AI generated omnidirectional images exhibit unique quality
issues, however, research on the quality assessment and optimization of
AI-generated omnidirectional images is still lacking. To this end, this work
first studies the quality assessment and distortion-aware saliency prediction
problems for AIGODIs, and further presents a corresponding optimization
process. Specifically, we first establish a comprehensive database to reflect
human feedback for AI-generated omnidirectionals, termed OHF2024, which
includes both subjective quality ratings evaluated from three perspectives and
distortion-aware salient regions. Based on the constructed OHF2024 database, we
propose two models with shared encoders based on the BLIP-2 model to evaluate
the human visual experience and predict distortion-aware saliency for
AI-generated omnidirectional images, which are named as BLIP2OIQA and
BLIP2OISal, respectively. Finally, based on the proposed models, we present an
automatic optimization process that utilizes the predicted visual experience
scores and distortion regions to further enhance the visual quality of an
AI-generated omnidirectional image. Extensive experiments show that our
BLIP2OIQA model and BLIP2OISal model achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
the human visual experience evaluation task and the distortion-aware saliency
prediction task for AI generated omnidirectional images, and can be effectively
used in the optimization process. The database and codes will be released on
https://github.com/IntMeGroup/AIGCOIQA to facilitate future research.

Result: 在ISPRS Vaihingen和Potsdam数据集上，SDRNet表现优于现有DCNNs。

Conclusion: SDRNet通过多上下文特征学习和全局-局部上下文结合，有效提升了语义分割性能。

Abstract: Land cover maps generated from semantic segmentation of high-resolution
remotely sensed images have drawn mucon in the photogrammetry and remote
sensing research community. Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed
(FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become
available. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is
greatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key
ground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the
extraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image
feature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS
images for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These
challenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and
generate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning
multi-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes
from the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class
disparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly
lose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor
segmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked
deep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The
proposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness
long-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual
blocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient
global dependencies thus improving segmentation performance. Our experimental
results obtained using the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate
that the SDRNet performs effectively and competitively against current DCNNs in
semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Point cloud understanding aims to acquire robust and general feature
representations from unlabeled data. Masked point modeling-based methods have
recently shown significant performance across various downstream tasks. These
pre-training methods rely on random masking strategies to establish the
perception of point clouds by restoring corrupted point cloud inputs, which
leads to the failure of capturing reasonable semantic relationships by the
self-supervised models. To address this issue, we propose Semantic Masked
Autoencoder, which comprises two main components: a prototype-based component
semantic modeling module and a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy.
Specifically, in the component semantic modeling module, we design a component
semantic guidance mechanism to direct a set of learnable prototypes in
capturing the semantics of different components from objects. Leveraging these
prototypes, we develop a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy that
addresses the limitations of random masking in effectively covering complete
component structures. Furthermore, we introduce a component semantic-enhanced
prompt-tuning strategy, which further leverages these prototypes to improve the
performance of pre-trained models in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
conducted on datasets such as ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

Conclusion: TASeg通过结合多模态特征和文本信息，有效解决了现有模型的局限性，提升了语义分割的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Reliable semantic segmentation of open environments is essential for
intelligent systems, yet significant problems remain: 1) Existing RGB-T
semantic segmentation models mainly rely on low-level visual features and lack
high-level textual information, which struggle with accurate segmentation when
categories share similar visual characteristics. 2) While SAM excels in
instance-level segmentation, integrating it with thermal images and text is
hindered by modality heterogeneity and computational inefficiency. To address
these, we propose TASeg, a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework by using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology to adapt vision foundation
models. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) in the
image encoder, which effectively merges features from multiple visual
modalities while freezing SAM's original transformer blocks. Additionally, we
incorporate CLIP-generated text embeddings in the mask decoder to enable
semantic alignment, which further rectifies the classification error and
improves the semantic understanding accuracy. Experimental results across
diverse datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in
challenging scenarios with fewer trainable parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉跟踪方法依赖大规模监督训练且缺乏灵活性，而MLLMs在基础任务中表现优异，但直接应用于跟踪任务效果不佳，因此需要改进。

Method: 使用GRPO强化学习方法在小规模数据集上微调Qwen2.5-VL，生成模型R1-Track。

Result: R1-Track在GOT-10k基准上表现优异，支持通过边界框或文本描述灵活初始化。

Conclusion: R1-Track展示了MLLMs在视觉跟踪任务中的潜力，并讨论了进一步改进的方向。

Abstract: Visual single object tracking aims to continuously localize and estimate the
scale of a target in subsequent video frames, given only its initial state in
the first frame. This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching
problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters,
two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress
achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and
regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets,
and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent
years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly.
Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational
capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has
spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However,
experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between
image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned
Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement
learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The
resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k
benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text
descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities.
And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough
technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.

Abstract: We address the problem of generating long-horizon videos for robotic
manipulation tasks. Text-to-video diffusion models have made significant
progress in photorealism, language understanding, and motion generation but
struggle with long-horizon robotic tasks. Recent works use video diffusion
models for high-quality simulation data and predictive rollouts in robot
planning. However, these works predict short sequences of the robot achieving
one task and employ an autoregressive paradigm to extend to the long horizon,
leading to error accumulations in the generated video and in the execution. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pipeline that bypasses the need
for autoregressive generation. We achieve this through a threefold
contribution: 1) we first decompose the high-level goals into smaller atomic
tasks and generate keyframes aligned with these instructions. A second
diffusion model then interpolates between each of the two generated frames,
achieving the long-horizon video. 2) We propose a semantics preserving
attention module to maintain consistency between the keyframes. 3) We design a
lightweight policy model to regress the robot joint states from generated
videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks in
video quality and consistency while outperforming previous policy models on
long-horizon tasks.

Motivation: 现代深度神经网络（DNNs）的复杂性和规模快速增长，导致计算成本和内存使用问题，需要更高效的模型压缩技术。现有扭矩正则化方法剪枝效果不佳，网络仍密集且准确性下降明显。

Method: 提出指数扭矩剪枝（ETP），采用指数力应用方案对神经模块进行正则化，有效剪除冗余和远距离模块，保留必要模块。

Result: 实验结果表明，ETP在多种领域显著提高了压缩率，且准确性下降几乎可忽略。

Conclusion: ETP是一种简单但高效的剪枝策略，优于现有技术。

Abstract: The rapid growth in complexity and size of modern deep neural networks (DNNs)
has increased challenges related to computational costs and memory usage,
spurring a growing interest in efficient model compression techniques. Previous
state-of-the-art approach proposes using a Torque-inspired regularization which
forces the weights of neural modules around a selected pivot point. Whereas, we
observe that the pruning effect of this approach is far from perfect, as the
post-trained network is still dense and also suffers from high accuracy drop.
In this work, we attribute such ineffectiveness to the default linear force
application scheme, which imposes inappropriate force on neural module of
different distances. To efficiently prune the redundant and distant modules
while retaining those that are close and necessary for effective inference, in
this work, we propose Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP), which adopts an
exponential force application scheme for regularization. Experimental results
on a broad range of domains demonstrate that, though being extremely simple,
ETP manages to achieve significantly higher compression rate than the previous
state-of-the-art pruning strategies with negligible accuracy drop.

Abstract: Facial stylization aims to transform facial images into appealing,
high-quality stylized portraits, with the critical challenge of accurately
learning the target style while maintaining content consistency with the
original image. Although previous StyleGAN-based methods have made significant
advancements, the generated results still suffer from artifacts or insufficient
fidelity to the source image. We argue that these issues stem from neglecting
semantic shift of the generator during stylization. Therefore, we propose a
facial stylization method that integrates semantic preservation constraint and
pseudo-paired supervision to enhance the content correspondence and improve the
stylization effect. Additionally, we develop a methodology for creating
multi-level pseudo-paired datasets to implement supervisory constraint.
Furthermore, building upon our facial stylization framework, we achieve more
flexible multimodal and reference-guided stylization without complex network
architecture designs or additional training. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach produces high-fidelity, aesthetically pleasing facial style
transfer that surpasses previous methods.

Abstract: Detecting and tracking ground objects using earth observation imagery remains
a significant challenge in the field of remote sensing. Continuous maritime
ship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue,
law enforcement, and shipping analysis. However, most current ship tracking
methods rely on geostationary satellites or video satellites. The former offer
low resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have
short filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable
for the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations,
we present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship
Re-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical
and SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables
all-weather tracking. HOSS ReID dataset includes images of the same ship
captured over extended periods under diverse conditions, using different
satellites of different modalities at varying times and angles. Furthermore, we
propose a baseline method for cross-modal ship re-identification, TransOSS,
which is built on the Vision Transformer architecture. It refines the patch
embedding structure to better accommodate cross-modal tasks, incorporates
additional embeddings to introduce more reference information, and employs
contrastive learning to pre-train on large-scale optical-SAR image pairs,
ensuring the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features. Our
dataset and baseline method are publicly available on

Motivation: 零样本语义分割（ZSS）需要从已见类别的监督中分割未见类别，但现有方法在视觉-语言对齐和局部特征与全局表示的语义鸿沟方面存在挑战。

Method: 提出Chimera-Seg，结合分割主干和CLIP语义头，以及选择性全局蒸馏（SGD）和语义对齐模块（SAM），以解决对齐和语义鸿沟问题。

Result: 在两个基准测试中，hIoU分别提升了0.9%和1.2%。

Conclusion: Chimera-Seg和SGD有效解决了ZSS中的关键挑战，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment both seen and unseen
classes using supervision from only seen classes. Beyond adaptation-based
methods, distillation-based approaches transfer vision-language alignment of
vision-language model, e.g., CLIP, to segmentation models. However, such
knowledge transfer remains challenging due to: (1) the difficulty of aligning
vision-based features with the textual space, which requires combining spatial
precision with vision-language alignment; and (2) the semantic gap between
CLIP's global representations and the local, fine-grained features of
segmentation models. To address challenge (1), we propose Chimera-Seg, which
integrates a segmentation backbone as the body and a CLIP-based semantic head
as the head, like the Chimera in Greek mythology, combining spatial precision
with vision-language alignment. Specifically, Chimera-Seg comprises a trainable
segmentation model and a CLIP Semantic Head (CSH), which maps dense features
into the CLIP-aligned space. The CSH incorporates a frozen subnetwork and fixed
projection layers from the CLIP visual encoder, along with lightweight
trainable components. The partial module from CLIP visual encoder, paired with
the segmentation model, retains segmentation capability while easing the
mapping to CLIP's semantic space. To address challenge (2), we propose
Selective Global Distillation (SGD), which distills knowledge from dense
features exhibiting high similarity to the CLIP CLS token, while gradually
reducing the number of features used for alignment as training progresses.
Besides, we also use a Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to further align dense
visual features with semantic embeddings extracted from the frozen CLIP text
encoder. Experiments on two benchmarks show improvements of 0.9% and 1.2% in
hIoU.

Abstract: Reconstruction and rendering-based talking head synthesis methods achieve
high-quality results with strong identity preservation but are limited by their
dependence on identity-specific models. Each new identity requires training
from scratch, incurring high computational costs and reduced scalability
compared to generative model-based approaches. To overcome this limitation, we
propose FIAG, a novel 3D speaking head synthesis framework that enables
efficient identity-specific adaptation using only a few training footage. FIAG
incorporates Global Gaussian Field, which supports the representation of
multiple identities within a shared field, and Universal Motion Field, which
captures the common motion dynamics across diverse identities. Benefiting from
the shared facial structure information encoded in the Global Gaussian Field
and the general motion priors learned in the motion field, our framework
enables rapid adaptation from canonical identity representations to specific
ones with minimal data. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches,
validating both the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过强制直线约束提高左心室测量准确性的新框架，结合解剖M模式和B模式图像，减少了人工标注误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动标注左心室标志点耗时且易错，现有深度学习方法常导致标志点错位，影响测量准确性。

Method: 训练标志点检测器于解剖M模式图像，实时从B模式视频计算并转换回B模式空间，结合半自动设计，用户仅需放置虚拟扫描线。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比标准B模式方法更准确，且适用于不同网络架构。

Conclusion: 该框架通过半自动设计和直线约束，显著提高了左心室测量的准确性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Linear measurements of the left ventricle (LV) in the Parasternal Long Axis
(PLAX) view using B-mode echocardiography are crucial for cardiac assessment.
These involve placing 4-6 landmarks along a virtual scanline (SL) perpendicular
to the LV axis near the mitral valve tips. Manual placement is time-consuming
and error-prone, while existing deep learning methods often misalign landmarks,
causing inaccurate measurements. We propose a novel framework that enhances LV
measurement accuracy by enforcing straight-line constraints. A landmark
detector is trained on Anatomical M-Mode (AMM) images, computed in real time
from B-mode videos, then transformed back to B-mode space. This approach
addresses misalignment and reduces measurement errors. Experiments show
improved accuracy over standard B-mode methods, and the framework generalizes
well across network architectures. Our semi-automatic design includes a
human-in-the-loop step where the user only places the SL, simplifying
interaction while preserving alignment flexibility and clinical relevance.

TL;DR: MirrorMe是一个基于LTX视频模型的实时、可控框架，通过扩散变换器实现高效潜在空间去噪，解决了音频驱动肖像动画的高延迟和时间一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频驱动肖像动画在实时生成高保真、时间一致的视频方面面临挑战，现有扩散方法因逐帧UNet架构导致高延迟和时间不一致。

Method: 提出MirrorMe框架，包括：1. 参考身份注入机制；2. 因果音频编码器和适配器；3. 渐进式训练策略。

Result: 在EMTD Benchmark上，MirrorMe在保真度、唇语同步准确性和时间稳定性方面表现最优。

Conclusion: MirrorMe通过创新设计实现了实时、高质量的音频驱动肖像动画生成。

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation, which synthesizes realistic videos from
reference images using audio signals, faces significant challenges in real-time
generation of high-fidelity, temporally coherent animations. While recent
diffusion-based methods improve generation quality by integrating audio into
denoising processes, their reliance on frame-by-frame UNet architectures
introduces prohibitive latency and struggles with temporal consistency. This
paper introduces MirrorMe, a real-time, controllable framework built on the LTX
video model, a diffusion transformer that compresses video spatially and
temporally for efficient latent space denoising. To address LTX's trade-offs
between compression and semantic fidelity, we propose three innovations: 1. A
reference identity injection mechanism via VAE-encoded image concatenation and
self-attention, ensuring identity consistency; 2. A causal audio encoder and
adapter tailored to LTX's temporal structure, enabling precise audio-expression
synchronization; and 3. A progressive training strategy combining close-up
facial training, half-body synthesis with facial masking, and hand pose
integration for enhanced gesture control. Extensive experiments on the EMTD
Benchmark demonstrate MirrorMe's state-of-the-art performance in fidelity,
lip-sync accuracy, and temporal stability.

*Petr Hruby,Marc Pollefeys*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖方法，通过单扫描线投影的交点估计滚动快门相机的相对位姿，无需显式建模相机运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决滚动快门相机在结构从运动（SfM）中的位姿估计问题，避免复杂的运动建模。

Method: 利用线投影与单扫描线的交点进行位姿估计，支持单视图或多视图场景，并开发最小求解器处理平行线和已知重力方向的情况。

Result: 在Fastec数据集上验证了方法的可行性，展示了其在滚动快门SfM初始化中的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为滚动快门SfM提供了基础模块，具有进一步开发的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for estimating the relative pose between rolling
shutter cameras using the intersections of line projections with a single
scanline per image. This allows pose estimation without explicitly modeling
camera motion. Alternatively, scanlines can be selected within a single image,
enabling single-view relative pose estimation for scanlines of rolling shutter
cameras. Our approach is designed as a foundational building block for rolling
shutter structure-from-motion (SfM), where no motion model is required, and
each scanline's pose can be computed independently. % We classify minimal
solvers for this problem in both generic and specialized settings, including
cases with parallel lines and known gravity direction, assuming known
intrinsics and no lens distortion. Furthermore, we develop minimal solvers for
the parallel-lines scenario, both with and without gravity priors, by
leveraging connections between this problem and the estimation of 2D structure
from 1D cameras. % Experiments on rolling shutter images from the Fastec
dataset demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for initializing rolling
shutter SfM, highlighting its potential for further development. % The code
will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的学习范式，通过增加推理时间（计算资源）提升机器在视觉任务中的推理能力，尤其在数据稀缺场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类推理能力强大，而机器智能受限于训练数据，无法在推理时动态优化解决方案。现有机器推理研究多集中于语言领域，非语言推理（如视觉、空间推理）仍是挑战。

Method: 受心理学双过程理论启发，结合快速思维的System I模块和慢速思维的System II模块，通过自玩强化学习迭代优化解决方案。

Result: 在视觉任务（包括计算机视觉基准和医学图像癌症定位）中，表现优于大规模监督学习、基础模型甚至人类专家。

Conclusion: 该范式为非语言机器推理提供了突破性潜力，尤其在数据稀缺场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, enabling adaptive
decision-making in complex and unfamiliar scenarios. In contrast, machine
intelligence remains bound to training data, lacking the ability to dynamically
refine solutions at inference time. While some recent advances have explored
reasoning in machines, these efforts are largely limited to verbal domains such
as mathematical problem-solving, where explicit rules govern step-by-step
reasoning. Other critical real-world tasks - including visual perception,
spatial reasoning, and radiological diagnosis - require non-verbal reasoning,
which remains an open challenge. Here we present a novel learning paradigm that
enables machine reasoning in vision by allowing performance improvement with
increasing thinking time (inference-time compute), even under conditions where
labelled data is very limited. Inspired by dual-process theories of human
cognition in psychology, our approach integrates a fast-thinking System I
module for familiar tasks, with a slow-thinking System II module that
iteratively refines solutions using self-play reinforcement learning. This
paradigm mimics human reasoning by proposing, competing over, and refining
solutions in data-scarce scenarios. We demonstrate superior performance through
extended thinking time, compared not only to large-scale supervised learning
but also foundation models and even human experts, in real-world vision tasks.
These tasks include computer-vision benchmarks and cancer localisation on
medical images across five organs, showcasing transformative potential for
non-verbal machine reasoning.

Method: 提出周期性引导的rPPG估计方法，并通过生成器重构长信号以保持周期性一致性。

Result: 在四个rPPG基准数据集上验证，方法不仅准确测量超短视频心率，且性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在超短视频心率测量中表现优异，达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Many remote Heart Rate (HR) measurement methods focus on estimating remote
photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals from video clips lasting around 10 seconds
but often overlook the need for HR estimation from ultra-short video clips. In
this paper, we aim to accurately measure HR from ultra-short 2-second video
clips by specifically addressing two key challenges. First, to overcome the
limited number of heartbeat cycles in ultra-short video clips, we propose an
effective periodicity-guided rPPG estimation method that enforces consistent
periodicity between rPPG signals estimated from ultra-short clips and their
much longer ground truth signals. Next, to mitigate estimation inaccuracies due
to spectral leakage, we propose including a generator to reconstruct longer
rPPG signals from ultra-short ones while preserving their periodic consistency
to enable more accurate HR measurement. Extensive experiments on four rPPG
estimation benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method not only
accurately measures HR from ultra-short video clips but also outperform
previous rPPG estimation techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖高精度物体姿态标注，限制了大规模场景重建。

Method: 使用可学习的Bézier曲线建模动态物体轨迹，引入动态物体渲染和曲线一致性约束。

Result: 在Waymo和nuPlan数据集上，BézierGS在动态和静态场景重建及新视角合成中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BézierGS通过曲线建模和额外监督，实现了高效准确的街景重建。

Abstract: The realistic reconstruction of street scenes is critical for developing
real-world simulators in autonomous driving. Most existing methods rely on
object pose annotations, using these poses to reconstruct dynamic objects and
move them during the rendering process. This dependence on high-precision
object annotations limits large-scale and extensive scene reconstruction. To
address this challenge, we propose B\'ezier curve Gaussian splatting
(B\'ezierGS), which represents the motion trajectories of dynamic objects using
learnable B\'ezier curves. This approach fully leverages the temporal
information of dynamic objects and, through learnable curve modeling,
automatically corrects pose errors. By introducing additional supervision on
dynamic object rendering and inter-curve consistency constraints, we achieve
reasonable and accurate separation and reconstruction of scene elements.
Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuPlan benchmark
demonstrate that B\'ezierGS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in both
dynamic and static scene components reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Motivation: ADNet在背景建模和适应性阈值方面存在不足，TPM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: TPM绑定前景和背景分布的原型位置，支持多原型和多类分割，并利用类先验优化阈值。

Result: TPM显著提高了分割精度，尤其在多类分割和非典型背景特征分离上表现优异。

Conclusion: TPM为医学图像少样本分割提供了新的原型建模视角，性能优于ADNet。

Abstract: Common prototype-based medical image few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods
model foreground and background classes using class-specific prototypes.
However, given the high variability of the background, a more promising
direction is to focus solely on foreground modeling, treating the background as
an anomaly -- an approach introduced by ADNet. Yet, ADNet faces three key
limitations: dependence on a single prototype per class, a focus on binary
classification, and fixed thresholds that fail to adapt to patient and organ
variability. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Tied Prototype Model
(TPM), a principled reformulation of ADNet with tied prototype locations for
foreground and background distributions. Building on its probabilistic
foundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class
segmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features.
Notably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy. Finally, we
leverage naturally occurring class priors to define an ideal target for
adaptive thresholds, boosting segmentation performance. Taken together, TPM
provides a fresh perspective on prototype-based FSS for medical image
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/hjk92g/TPM-FSS.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving, accurately predicting
pedestrian behavior has become essential for ensuring safety in complex and
unpredictable traffic conditions. The growing interest in this challenge
highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured
environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to
enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce
an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of
modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination
changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and
vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed
low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the
ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention
prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to
$\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an
increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets.
Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of
intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new
challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust
models. Project Page:

Conclusion: 自动化管道重建支持数字孪生开发，降低成本并提高建模速度和精度。

Abstract: Accurate digital twins of industrial assets, such as ships and offshore
platforms, rely on the precise reconstruction of complex pipe networks.
However, manual modelling of pipes from laser scan data is a time-consuming and
labor-intensive process. This paper presents a pipeline for automated pipe
reconstruction from incomplete laser scan data. The approach estimates a
skeleton curve using Laplacian-based contraction, followed by curve elongation.
The skeleton axis is then recentred using a rolling sphere technique combined
with 2D circle fitting, and refined with a 3D smoothing step. This enables the
determination of pipe properties, including radius, length and orientation, and
facilitates the creation of detailed 3D models of complex pipe networks. By
automating pipe reconstruction, this approach supports the development of
digital twins, allowing for rapid and accurate modeling while reducing costs.

Conclusion: CP-INR结合了CP分解的天然结构和神经网络的非线性能力，通过稀疏性和平滑性正则化，在多维数据恢复任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Higher-order tensors are well-suited for representing multi-dimensional data,
such as color images and videos. Low-rank tensor representation has become
essential in machine learning and computer vision, but existing methods like
Tucker decomposition offer flexibility at the expense of interpretability. In
contrast, while the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition provides a more
natural and interpretable tensor structure, obtaining sparse solutions remains
challenging. Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a
CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks for implicit
neural representation (CP-INR). This approach enables continuous data
representation beyond structured grids, fully exploiting the non-linearity of
tensor data with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve a
sparse CP decomposition, we introduce a variational form of the Schatten-p
quasi-norm and prove its relationship to multilinear rank minimization. For
smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the
Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. Our proposed smoothness
regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule derivations. It can
serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV) regularization in image
denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to continuous data. Extensive
experiments on multi-dimensional data recovery tasks, including image
inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling, demonstrate the superiority
and versatility of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Q-Frame通过自适应帧选择和计算资源优化，显著提升了视频-LLM的性能和适用性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
success in visual understanding tasks. However, challenges persist in adapting
these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and
temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often
struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos
effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive
frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content
and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy
generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max
trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more
frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical
temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness
through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing
methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过增强视觉输入的低级空间结构（如水平线）并结合文本提示的方法，显著提升了视觉语言模型在视觉推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在视觉推理任务中存在绑定问题，即难以可靠地将感知特征与正确的视觉对象关联，导致在计数、视觉搜索等任务中表现不佳。

Method: 通过向视觉输入添加低级空间结构（如水平线），并结合鼓励序列化、空间感知解析的文本提示，改进模型的视觉推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉搜索任务中准确率提升25.00%，计数任务提升26.83%，场景描述任务编辑距离误差减少0.32，空间关系任务提升9.50%。

Conclusion: 低级的视觉结构调整是提升视觉语言模型在空间任务中性能的有效且未被充分探索的方向，优于纯语言策略。

Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual
reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to
reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents.
This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual
search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor
is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking
mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a
simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level
spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual
prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically
demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by
25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in
scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship
tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the
visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies,
including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade
performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference,
underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely
linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual
structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving
compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for
enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

Motivation: 现有基于OCT图像数据训练的基础模型缺乏全面的语义理解，尤其在复杂任务中表现不佳，需要监督微调，但成本高昂且不切实际。

Method: 提出RetFiner，利用多样化的训练目标，结合文本数据的监督信号，优化现有FMs的表征能力。

Result: 在七个多样化的OCT分类任务中，RetFiner显著提升了RETFound、UrFound和VisionFM的线性探测性能，平均分别提高了5.8、3.9和2.1个百分点。

Conclusion: RetFiner通过视觉语言细化，有效提升了基础模型的下游任务性能，且无需监督微调。

Abstract: The rise of imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
advances in deep learning (DL) have enabled clinicians and researchers to
streamline retinal disease staging. A popular DL approach is self-supervised
learning (SSL), where models learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data,
avoiding costly annotation. SSL has allowed the development of foundation
models (FMs), large models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks.
However, existing FMs for OCT, trained solely on image data, lack a
comprehensive and robust semantic understanding of images, as evidenced by
their downstream performance (especially for complex tasks), and thus require
supervised fine-tuning (which may be unfeasible) to better adapt to specific
applications and populations. To address this, we propose RetFiner, an SSL
vision-language refinement scheme that improves the representations of existing
FMs and enables their efficient and direct adaptation to specific populations
for improved downstream performance. Our method uses a diverse set of training
objectives which take advantage of the rich supervisory signal found in textual
data. We tested RetFiner on the retinal FMs RETFound, UrFound, and VisionFM,
showing significant improvements in linear probing performance on seven highly
diverse OCT classification tasks, with an average increase of 5.8, 3.9, and 2.1
percentage points over their baselines, respectively. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at https://github.com/ronnief1/RetFiner.

Motivation: 现有Few-shot目标检测方法在共享特征空间中纠缠目标识别和分类，导致类特定目标标准和不具代表性的新类样本问题。

Method: 提出UOFS框架，解耦特征空间为幅度（目标性）和角度（分类），并采用HBO策略优化背景和前景实例。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于基于纠缠特征空间的现有方法。

Conclusion: UOFS框架通过解耦和优化策略，有效提升了Few-shot目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect objects with limited samples
for novel classes, while relying on abundant data for base classes. Existing
FSOD approaches, predominantly built on the Faster R-CNN detector, entangle
objectness recognition and foreground classification within shared feature
spaces. This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria
and suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this
limitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization
framework. First, UOFS decouples the feature space into two orthogonal
components, where magnitude encodes objectness and angle encodes
classification. This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness
knowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the
disentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set
images contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between
potential novel class instances and backgrounds. (2) Angular optimization
depends exclusively on base class foreground instances, inducing overfitting of
angular distributions to base classes. To address these challenges, we propose
a Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) strategy: (1) Constructing a pure
background base set by removing unlabeled instances in original images to
provide unbiased magnitude-based objectness supervision. (2) Incorporating
unlabeled foreground instances in the original base set into angular
optimization to enhance distribution uniformity. Additionally, we propose a
Spatial-wise Attention Disentanglement and Association (SADA) module to address
task conflicts between class-agnostic and class-specific tasks. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches based
on entangled feature spaces.

approaches have primarily focused on aligning visual and semantic
representations but often overlooked the importance of fine-grained action
patterns in the semantic space (e.g., the hand movements in drinking water and
brushing teeth). To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic
Enhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic
representation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three
key components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and
low-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve
the robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action
description with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global
correspondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the
inherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated
cross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance
ambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text
features, thereby ensuring robust alignment. Evaluations on the benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, validating that
frequency-enhanced semantic features enable robust differentiation of visually
and semantically similar action clusters, improving zero-shot action
recognition.

Abstract: Robust and accurate 2D/3D registration, which aligns preoperative models with
intraoperative images of the same anatomy, is crucial for successful
interventional navigation. To mitigate the challenge of a limited field of view
in single-image intraoperative scenarios, multi-view 2D/3D registration is
required by leveraging multiple intraoperative images. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach comprising two
stages. In the first stage, a combined loss function is designed, incorporating
both the differences between predicted and ground-truth poses and the
dissimilarities (e.g., normalized cross-correlation) between simulated and
observed intraoperative images. More importantly, additional cross-view
training loss terms are introduced for both pose and image losses to explicitly
enforce cross-view constraints. In the second stage, test-time optimization is
performed to refine the estimated poses from the coarse stage. Our method
exploits the mutual constraints of multi-view projection poses to enhance the
robustness of the registration process. The proposed framework achieves a mean
target registration error (mTRE) of $0.79 \pm 2.17$ mm on six specimens from
the DeepFluoro dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art registration algorithms.

Conclusion: ReF-LLE为低光图像增强提供了一种高效且个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement presents two primary challenges: 1) Significant
variations in low-light images across different conditions, and 2) Enhancement
levels influenced by subjective preferences and user intent. To address these
issues, we propose ReF-LLE, a novel personalized low-light image enhancement
method that operates in the Fourier frequency domain and incorporates deep
reinforcement learning. ReF-LLE is the first to integrate deep reinforcement
learning into this domain. During training, a zero-reference image evaluation
strategy is introduced to score enhanced images, providing reward signals that
guide the model to handle varying degrees of low-light conditions effectively.
In the inference phase, ReF-LLE employs a personalized adaptive iterative
strategy, guided by the zero-frequency component in the Fourier domain, which
represents the overall illumination level. This strategy enables the model to
adaptively adjust low-light images to align with the illumination distribution
of a user-provided reference image, ensuring personalized enhancement results.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReF-LLE
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior perceptual quality and
adaptability in personalized low-light image enhancement.

Abstract: Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are
common in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial
for identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these
perturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they
can actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data
augmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on
classical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical
machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere
rotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet
effective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional
augmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations
lack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like
image classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation
methods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to
classical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch
rotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet
dataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves
image classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5
accuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard
classical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary
augmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in
principle, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential
applications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation
approach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy
and discuss the implications of this limitation.

Conclusion: 4D-VLA通过整合时空信息有效解决了预训练中的混乱问题，提升了模型的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Leveraging diverse robotic data for pretraining remains a critical challenge.
Existing methods typically model the dataset's action distribution using simple
observations as inputs. However, these inputs are often incomplete, resulting
in a dispersed conditional action distribution-an issue we refer to as
coordinate system chaos and state chaos. This inconsistency significantly
hampers pretraining efficiency. To address this, we propose 4D-VLA, a novel
approach that effectively integrates 4D information into the input to mitigate
these sources of chaos. Our model introduces depth and temporal information
into visual features with sequential RGB-D inputs, aligning the coordinate
systems of the robot and the scene. This alignment endows the model with strong
spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities while minimizing training overhead.
Additionally, we introduce memory bank sampling, a frame sampling strategy
designed to extract informative frames from historical images, further
improving effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that
our pretraining method and architectural components substantially enhance model
performance. In both simulated and real-world experiments, our model achieves a
significant increase in success rate over OpenVLA. To further assess spatial
perception and generalization to novel views, we introduce MV-Bench, a
multi-view simulation benchmark. Our model consistently outperforms existing
methods, demonstrating stronger spatial understanding and adaptability.

Conclusion: EAMamba是一种高效且性能优越的图像修复方法，解决了Vision Mamba的局限性。

Abstract: Image restoration is a key task in low-level computer vision that aims to
reconstruct high-quality images from degraded inputs. The emergence of Vision
Mamba, which draws inspiration from the advanced state space model Mamba, marks
a significant advancement in this field. Vision Mamba demonstrates excellence
in modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, a crucial advantage
for image restoration tasks. Despite its strengths, Vision Mamba encounters
challenges in low-level vision tasks, including computational complexity that
scales with the number of scanning sequences and local pixel forgetting. To
address these limitations, this study introduces Efficient All-Around Mamba
(EAMamba), an enhanced framework that incorporates a Multi-Head Selective Scan
Module (MHSSM) with an all-around scanning mechanism. MHSSM efficiently
aggregates multiple scanning sequences, which avoids increases in computational
complexity and parameter count. The all-around scanning strategy implements
multiple patterns to capture holistic information and resolves the local pixel
forgetting issue. Our experimental evaluations validate these innovations
across several restoration tasks, including super resolution, denoising,
deblurring, and dehazing. The results validate that EAMamba achieves a
significant 31-89% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining favorable performance
compared to existing low-level Vision Mamba methods.

Motivation: 探讨VLMs是否像人类一样依赖场景上下文生成对象引用。

Method: 使用COOCO数据集，测试VLMs在不同场景-对象一致性和噪声水平下的表现。

Result: 模型会根据场景-对象语义相关性和噪声水平动态调整对上下文的依赖，尤其在目标-场景高度一致或对象退化时更依赖上下文。

Conclusion: VLMs能动态平衡局部和上下文信息，中层注意力分析表明其在适度噪声下更关注目标对象。

Abstract: Natural scenes provide us with rich contexts for object recognition and
reference. In particular, knowing what type of scene one is looking at
generates expectations about which objects will occur, and what their spatial
configuration should be. Do Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn to rely on
scene contexts in a similar way, when generating references to objects? To
address this question, we introduce the \textit{Common Objects Out-of-Context
(COOCO)} dataset and test to what extent VLMs rely on scene context to refer to
objects under different degrees of scene-object congruency, and different
perturbations. Our findings show that models leverage scene context adaptively,
depending on both the semantic relatedness between object and scene and the
level of noise. In particular, models rely more on context under high
target-scene congruence or when objects are degraded. Attention analysis
reveals that successful object categorisation involves increased focus on the
target in mid-level layers, especially under moderate noise, suggesting that
VLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for reference
generation. We make our dataset, code and models available at

Conclusion: VisionDrop通过视觉内注意力修剪令牌，解决了跨模态不对齐问题，实现了高效且性能优越的视觉令牌修剪。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) encode visual inputs as dense sequences
of patch-level tokens to capture fine-grained semantics. These visual tokens
often outnumber their textual counterparts by a large margin, leading to
substantial computational overhead and limiting the scalability of LVLMs in
practice. Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to
or within the large language models (LLM). However, most in-LLM reduction
approaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that
textual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this
work, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms
of cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of
text-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a
training-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual
tokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on
textual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy,
we treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a
progressive pruning pipeline. Our method performs dominant token selection and
lightweight contextual merging at multiple stages, enabling fine-grained visual
information to be retained even under aggressive token budgets. Extensive
experiments across diverse benchmarks show that VisionDrop achieves consistent
improvements over existing methods, despite requiring no additional training or
complex modifications. Its simple yet effective design enables efficient
inference while preserving strong performance across tasks.

Conclusion: RoomCraft通过多阶段流程和动态约束处理，有效解决了3D室内场景生成的挑战。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs remains a challenging
problem in computer vision and graphics, requiring careful balance of geometric
consistency, spatial relationships, and visual realism. While neural generation
methods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial
reasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable
generation but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints
become numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of
furniture items and compromising layout completeness.
  To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline
that converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D
indoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a
constraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts
high-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a
structured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.
It then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture
arrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a
heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.
To handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint
representation that processes both formal specifications and natural language
inputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a
comprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware
Positioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to
minimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms
existing methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually
appealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.

Result: 实验表明，OutDreamer在零样本设置下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OutDreamer通过创新设计和优化损失函数，显著提升了视频外绘的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Video outpainting is a challenging task that generates new video content by
extending beyond the boundaries of an original input video, requiring both
temporal and spatial consistency. Many state-of-the-art methods utilize latent
diffusion models with U-Net backbones but still struggle to achieve high
quality and adaptability in generated content. Diffusion transformers (DiTs)
have emerged as a promising alternative because of their superior performance.
We introduce OutDreamer, a DiT-based video outpainting framework comprising two
main components: an efficient video control branch and a conditional
outpainting branch. The efficient video control branch effectively extracts
masked video information, while the conditional outpainting branch generates
missing content based on these extracted conditions. Additionally, we propose a
mask-driven self-attention layer that dynamically integrates the given mask
information, further enhancing the model's adaptability to outpainting tasks.
Furthermore, we introduce a latent alignment loss to maintain overall
consistency both within and between frames. For long video outpainting, we
employ a cross-video-clip refiner to iteratively generate missing content,
ensuring temporal consistency across video clips. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our zero-shot OutDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods on widely recognized benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法首次解决了跨特征检测器的匹配问题，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods fail to solve visual localization in scenarios where
different devices use different sparse feature extraction algorithms to obtain
keypoints and their corresponding descriptors. Translating feature descriptors
is enough to enable matching. However, performance is drastically reduced in
cross-feature detector cases, because current solutions assume common
keypoints. This means that the same detector has to be used, which is rarely
the case in practice when different descriptors are used. The low repeatability
of keypoints, in addition to non-discriminatory and non-distinctive
descriptors, make the identification of true correspondences extremely
challenging. We present the first method tackling this problem, which performs
feature descriptor augmentation targeting cross-detector feature matching, and
then feature translation to a latent space. We show that our method
significantly improves image matching and visual localization in the
cross-feature scenario and evaluate the proposed method on several benchmarks.

Abstract: Building damage identification shortly after a disaster is crucial for
guiding emergency response and recovery efforts. Although optical satellite
imagery is commonly used for disaster mapping, its effectiveness is often
hampered by cloud cover or the absence of pre-event acquisitions. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning (DL) framework
for detecting building damage using single-date very high resolution (VHR)
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Italian Space Agency (ASI)
COSMO SkyMed (CSK) constellation, complemented by auxiliary geospatial data.
Our method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building
footprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure
attributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy
and contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre
and post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating
rapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is
demonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering
multiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that
incorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance
and generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with
detailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable
and rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available
pre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process
ensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions,
underscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and
recovery efforts. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance of the
paper.

Abstract: This paper analyses and addresses the performance gap in the fuzzy
vault-based \ac{BCS}. We identify unstable error correction capabilities, which
are caused by variable feature set sizes and their influence on similarity
thresholds, as a key source of performance degradation. This issue is further
compounded by information loss introduced through feature type transformations.
To address both problems, we propose a novel feature quantization method based
on \it{equal frequent intervals}. This method guarantees fixed feature set
sizes and supports training-free adaptation to any number of intervals. The
proposed approach significantly reduces the performance gap introduced by
template protection. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with existing
systems to minimize the negative effects of feature transformation. Experiments
on state-of-the-art face, fingerprint, and iris recognition systems confirm
that only minimal performance degradation remains, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the method across major biometric modalities.

compares these models under both standard conditions and in the presence of
simulated noise. Initial evaluations on the clean GEN1 dataset reveal that
ResNet34 and ViT B16 achieve accuracies of 88% and 86%, respectively, with
ResNet34 showing a slight advantage in classification accuracy. However, the
ViT B16 model demonstrates notable robustness, particularly given its
pre-training on a smaller dataset. Although this study focuses on ground-based

for adaptation to UAV contexts, including aerial object classification and
event-based vision systems for aviation-related tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE)任务，旨在提升视频大模型在动态推理中的能力，并提出了两种解决框架和新的评估数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法显著提升了模型的动态推理能力。

Conclusion: DVidE任务和相关框架为视频大模型的动态推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in
understanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive
reasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information
emerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context
can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce
Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think
like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.
In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine
whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification
version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment
relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we
propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual
reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce
inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines
ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually
relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals.
Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with
strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric
specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method
in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需监督重新训练的后处理方法，通过交叉熵一致性损失和伪标签一致性损失提升视觉语言模型的语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在语义等效输入下表现不一致，影响可靠性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出测试时一致性框架，包括交叉熵一致性损失和伪标签一致性损失，无需修改模型架构或大规模微调。

Result: 在MM-R3基准测试中显著提升模型一致性。

Conclusion: 为多模态学习的推理时适应提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
wide range of multimodal tasks, yet they often exhibit inconsistent behavior
when faced with semantically equivalent inputs, undermining their reliability
and robustness. Recent benchmarks, such as MM-R3, highlight that even
state-of-the-art VLMs can produce divergent predictions across semantically
equivalent inputs, despite maintaining high average accuracy. Prior work
addresses this issue by modifying model architectures or conducting large-scale
fine-tuning on curated datasets. In contrast, we propose a simple and effective
test-time consistency framework that enhances semantic consistency without
supervised re-training. Our method is entirely post-hoc, model-agnostic, and
applicable to any VLM with access to its weights. Given a single test point, we
enforce consistent predictions via two complementary objectives: (i) a
Cross-Entropy Agreement Loss that aligns predictive distributions across
semantically equivalent inputs, and (ii) a Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss that
draws outputs toward a self-averaged consensus. Our method is plug-and-play and
leverages information from a single test input itself to improve consistency.
Experiments on the MM-R3 benchmark show that our framework yields substantial
gains in consistency across state-of-the-art models, establishing a new
direction for inference-time adaptation in multimodal learning.

*Yuhao Liu,Tengfei Wang,Fang Liu,Zhenwei Wang,Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shape-for-Motion 是一种新颖的视频编辑框架，通过3D代理实现精确和一致的视频编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在确保用户意图的细粒度对齐方面仍存在挑战。

Method: 利用3D代理（时间一致的网格）进行编辑，并采用双传播策略简化编辑过程。

Result: 支持多种精确且物理一致的操作，实验证明了其优越性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为高质量、可控的视频编辑工作流程迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative modeling have unlocked unprecedented
opportunities for video synthesis. In real-world applications, however, users
often seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with
precise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing
methods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open
and challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel
framework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video
editing. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the
input video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be
performed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To
simplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that
allows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits
are then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D
meshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce
the edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a
decoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework
supports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the
video frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture
modification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward
high-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach. Project page:

*Sadra Safadoust,Fabio Tosi,Fatma Güney,Matteo Poggi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WarpRF是一个无需训练、通用的框架，用于量化辐射场的不确定性，通过反向变形和一致性测量实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常针对特定框架，缺乏通用性且需要训练，WarpRF旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用反向变形将可靠渲染投影到新视角，测量与渲染图像的一致性以量化不确定性。

Result: WarpRF在不确定性量化和下游任务（如主动视图选择和主动映射）中表现优异。

Conclusion: WarpRF简单高效，适用于任何辐射场实现，无需训练，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce WarpRF, a training-free general-purpose framework for
quantifying the uncertainty of radiance fields. Built upon the assumption that
photometric and geometric consistency should hold among images rendered by an
accurate model, WarpRF quantifies its underlying uncertainty from an unseen
point of view by leveraging backward warping across viewpoints, projecting
reliable renderings to the unseen viewpoint and measuring the consistency with
images rendered there. WarpRF is simple and inexpensive, does not require any
training, and can be applied to any radiance field implementation for free.
WarpRF excels at both uncertainty quantification and downstream tasks, e.g.,
active view selection and active mapping, outperforming any existing method
tailored to specific frameworks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过自监督视觉表示学习实现跨图像链式思维推理的方法，无需人工标注的问答对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工标注的问答对，难以处理细粒度视觉细节和跨图像的复杂逻辑。

Method: 构建包含同一图像的两个增强视图和一个相似但不同图像的三元组，通过规则强化学习优化模型推理能力。

Result: 模型在视觉比较任务上训练后，能泛化到多种问题，在多图像推理基准上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 自监督视觉约束可作为有效监督信号，提升模型的跨图像推理能力。

Abstract: This work explores enabling Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to link visual
cues across multiple images. A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based
reinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods
typically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be
particularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and
complex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation
learning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as
supervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two
augmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image.
During training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to
compare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the
model with rule-based reinforcement learning. Due to the high visual similarity
and the presence of augmentations, the model must attend to subtle visual
changes and perform logical reasoning to succeed. Experiments show that,
although trained solely on visual comparison tasks, the learned reasoning
ability generalizes effectively to a wide range of questions. Without relying
on any human-annotated question-answer pairs, our method achieves significant
improvements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and shows strong performance
on general vision tasks.

*Yongchao He,Bohan Zhao,Zheng Cao*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SiPipe是一种异构流水线设计，通过利用未充分利用的CPU资源来卸载辅助计算和通信，提高大型语言模型（LLM）推理的吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM推理工作负载的扩展，流水线并行（PP）在多GPU部署中广泛采用，但其存在执行效率低下的问题，如负载不平衡、阶段内和阶段间的执行气泡。

Method: SiPipe采用CPU采样、令牌安全执行模型和结构感知传输三种关键技术，以减少流水线气泡并提高执行效率。

Result: SiPipe在相同PP配置下，相比vLLM，吞吐量提高2.1倍，每令牌延迟降低43%，GPU利用率提高23%。

Conclusion: SiPipe展示了在多种LLM和部署场景中的通用性，显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: As inference workloads for large language models (LLMs) scale to meet growing
user demand, pipeline parallelism (PP) has become a widely adopted strategy for
multi-GPU deployment, particularly in cross-node setups, to improve key-value
(KV) cache capacity and inference throughput. However, PP suffers from inherent
inefficiencies caused by three types of execution bubbles-load-imbalance,
intra-stage, and inter-stage-which limit pipeline saturation. We present
SiPipe, a heterogeneous pipeline design that improves throughput by leveraging
underutilized CPU resources to offload auxiliary computation and communication.
SiPipe incorporates three key techniques-CPU sampling, a token-safe execution
model, and structure-aware transmission-to mitigate pipeline bubbles and
improve execution efficiency. Across diverse LLMs, SiPipe achieves up to 2.1
times higher throughput, 43% lower per-token latency, and up to 23% higher
average GPU utilization compared to the state-of-the-art vLLM under the same PP
configuration, demonstrating its generality across LLMs and deployment
scenarios.

TL;DR: SPTCStencil利用稀疏张量核心（SpTCs）加速模板计算，通过消除冗余零填充和优化矩阵乘法转换，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化技术在张量核心加速器上执行模板计算时因冗余零填充导致高开销，需解决这一问题以提高效率。

Method: 提出SPTCStencil系统，将模板计算高效转换为矩阵乘法，并通过稀疏化策略适配SpTCs，同时优化GPU内核以最大化性能。

Result: 实验表明，SPTCStencil平均性能提升5.46倍，优于传统张量核心方法的2倍。

Conclusion: SPTCStencil首次将SpTCs应用于非深度学习领域，显著提升了模板计算的效率。

Abstract: Stencil computation, a pivotal numerical method in science and engineering,
iteratively updates grid points using weighted neighbor contributions and
exhibits strong parallelism for multi-core processors. Current optimization
techniques targeting conducting stencil computation on tensor core accelerators
incur substantial overheads due to redundant zero-padding during the
transformation to matrix multiplication. To address this, we introduce a sparse
computation paradigm that eliminates inefficiencies by exploiting specialized
hardware units.
  This paper exploits the sparsity in these matrices as a feature and presents
SPTCStencil, a high-performance stencil computation system accelerated by
Sparse Tensor Core (SpTCs). SPTCStencil is the first to harness SpTCs for
acceleration beyond deep learning domains. First, Our approach generalizes an
efficient transformation of stencil computation into matrix multiplications and
specializes this conversion for SpTC compatibility through a novel
sparsification strategy. Furthermore, SPTCStencil incorporates a
high-performance GPU kernel with systematic optimizations designed to maximize
efficiency on SpTCs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SPTCStencil
5.46$\times$ and Tensor Core-based approaches by 2.00$\times$ on average.

*Zheng Zhang,Donglin Yang,Xiaobo Zhou,Dazhao Cheng*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: MCFuser是一个框架，用于高效融合内存密集型计算操作符，显著提升性能并减少调优时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多计算密集型操作符融合因计算吞吐饱和而受限，动态张量尺寸可能导致内存瓶颈，现有方法存在搜索空间有限、冗余内存访问和调优时间长的问题。

Method: MCFuser利用高级平铺表达式定义搜索空间，结合DAG分析消除冗余内存访问，通过剪枝搜索空间和启发式搜索加速调优。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100和RTX3080 GPU上，MCFuser性能提升最高达5.9倍，调优时间减少70倍以上。

Conclusion: MCFuser通过高效融合和优化策略，显著提升性能并加速部署，适用于内存密集型计算操作链。

Abstract: Operator fusion, a key technique to improve data locality and alleviate GPU
memory bandwidth pressure, often fails to extend to the fusion of multiple
compute-intensive operators due to saturated computation throughput. However,
the dynamicity of tensor dimension sizes could potentially lead to these
operators becoming memory-bound, necessitating the generation of fused kernels,
a task hindered by limited search spaces for fusion strategies, redundant
memory access, and prolonged tuning time, leading to sub-optimal performance
and inefficient deployment.
  We introduce MCFuser, a pioneering framework designed to overcome these
obstacles by generating high-performance fused kernels for what we define as
memory-bound compute-intensive (MBCI) operator chains. Leveraging high-level
tiling expressions to delineate a comprehensive search space, coupled with
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) analysis to eliminate redundant memory accesses,
MCFuser streamlines kernel optimization. By implementing guidelines to prune
the search space and incorporating an analytical performance model with a
heuristic search, MCFuser not only significantly accelerates the tuning process
but also demonstrates superior performance. Benchmarked against leading
compilers like Ansor on NVIDIA A100 and RTX3080 GPUs, MCFuser achieves up to a
5.9x speedup in kernel performance and outpaces other baselines while reducing
tuning time by over 70-fold, showcasing its agility.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Proof-of-Behavior (PoB)的共识模型，通过行为评分和动态权重调整，显著减少欺诈行为并提升区块链治理的安全性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有区块链协议（如PoW和PoS）无法衡量验证者的可信度，导致在DeFi等场景中难以防范细微的恶意行为。

Method: PoB模型通过分层行为评分（动机和结果）、动态调整验证者权重以及去中心化验证与惩罚机制，确保激励兼容性。

Result: 模拟实验显示，PoB将欺诈接受率降低90%以上，恶意验证者两轮内被降权，且吞吐量开销不超过5%。

Conclusion: PoB通过将共识影响力与可验证的可信行为挂钩，为金融应用中的区块链治理提供了可扩展且合规的解决方案。

Abstract: Current blockchain protocols (e.g., Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake) secure
the ledger yet cannot measure validator trustworthiness, allowing subtle
misconduct that is especially damaging in decentralized-finance (DeFi)
settings. We introduce Proof-of-Behavior (PoB), a consensus model that (i)
gives each action a layered utility score -- covering motivation and outcome,
(ii) adapts validator weights using recent scores, and (iii) applies
decentralized verification with proportional slashing. The reward design is
incentive-compatible, yielding a Nash equilibrium in which honest behavior
maximizes long-run pay-offs. Simulated DeFi experiments (loan-fraud detection,
reputation-weighted validation) show that PoB cuts fraud acceptance by more
than 90%, demotes malicious validators within two rounds, and improves proposer
fairness versus standard PoS, all with no more than a 5% throughput overhead.
By linking consensus influence to verifiably trustworthy conduct, PoB offers a
scalable, regulation-friendly foundation for secure and fair blockchain
governance in financial applications.

TL;DR: MPipeMoE是一个高性能库，通过自适应和内存高效的流水线并行加速MoE训练，实现了2.8倍的加速和47%的内存占用减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MoE技术在扩展预训练模型方面表现出色，但其通信和内存效率问题仍有待解决。

Method: 设计了自适应流水线并行和内存重用策略，结合硬件和模型特性动态优化。

Result: 在8台NVIDIA DGX A100服务器上测试，MPipeMoE比现有方法快2.8倍，内存占用减少47%。

Conclusion: MPipeMoE有效解决了MoE训练中的效率和内存问题，为大规模模型训练提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become one of the most popular
techniques to scale pre-trained models to extraordinarily large sizes. Dynamic
activation of experts allows for conditional computation, increasing the number
of parameters of neural networks, which is critical for absorbing the vast
amounts of knowledge available in many deep learning areas. However, despite
the existing system and algorithm optimizations, there are significant
challenges to be tackled when it comes to the inefficiencies of communication
and memory consumption.
  In this paper, we present the design and implementation of MPipeMoE, a
high-performance library that accelerates MoE training with adaptive and
memory-efficient pipeline parallelism. Inspired by that the MoE training
procedure can be divided into multiple independent sub-stages, we design
adaptive pipeline parallelism with an online algorithm to configure the
granularity of the pipelining. Further, we analyze the memory footprint
breakdown of MoE training and identify that activations and temporary buffers
are the primary contributors to the overall memory footprint. Toward memory
efficiency, we propose memory reusing strategies to reduce memory requirements
by eliminating memory redundancies, and develop an adaptive selection component
to determine the optimal strategy that considers both hardware capacities and
model characteristics at runtime. We implement MPipeMoE upon PyTorch and
evaluate it with common MoE models in a physical cluster consisting of 8 NVIDIA
DGX A100 servers. Compared with the state-of-art approach, MPipeMoE achieves up
to 2.8x speedup and reduces memory footprint by up to 47% in training large
models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于虚拟知识图谱（VKG）和大型语言模型（LLM）的端到端ODA聊天机器人系统，显著提高了查询效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式人工智能对科学计算的挑战，数据中心规模和容量激增，计算效率变得至关重要。传统ODA方法依赖实时遥测数据可视化和事后分析，但NoSQL数据库的无模式特性使查询复杂化。

Method: 利用VKG生成运行时查询特定图谱，结合LLM生成SPARQL查询，优化VKG构建和LLM推理。

Result: 系统查询准确率达92.5%（NoSQL直接查询仅25%），平均查询延迟降低85%（从20.36秒降至3.03秒），VKG大小控制在179 MiB内。

Conclusion: 该方法适合实时交互部署，显著提升了ODA系统的效率和可用性。

Abstract: With generative artificial intelligence challenging computational scientific
computing, data centers are experiencing unprecedented growth in both scale and
volume. As a result, computing efficiency has become more critical than ever.
Operational Data Analytics (ODA) relies on the collection of data center
telemetry to improve efficiency, but so far has been focusing on real-time
telemetry data visualization and post-mortem analysis. However, with NoSQL
databases now serving as the default storage backend to support scalability,
querying this data is challenging due to its schema-less nature, which requires
domain knowledge to traverse relationships between data sources. Ontologies and
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can capture these relationships, but traditional KGs are
costly to scale and have not been widely applied to multivariate timeseries.
Virtual Knowledge Graphs (VKGs) offer a lightweight alternative by generating
query-specific graphs at runtime. In this work, we present a full end-to-end
ODA chatbot system that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate SPARQL
queries, utilizing VKG for data retrieval. This approach achieves 92.5%
accuracy compared to 25% with direct NoSQL queries. The proposed methodology
optimizes VKG construction and LLM inference, cutting previous work average
query latency by 85% (from 20.36s to 3.03s) and keeping VKG sizes under 179
MiB. This performance makes the tool suitable for deployment and real-time
interaction with ODA end-users.

Conclusion: 该排序器为能源和资源受限的硬件系统提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer systems and is widely used in
applications such as databases, data analytics, and hardware accelerators.
Unary computing has recently emerged as a low-cost and power-efficient paradigm
for implementing hardware sorters by eliminating the need for complex
arithmetic operations. However, existing comparison-free unary computing-based
designs suffer from significant area and power overhead due to costly unary
number generators.
  In this paper, we present a novel ascending-order unary sorting module
featuring a finite-state-machine-based unary number generator that
significantly reduces implementation costs. By generating right-aligned unary
streams using a two-state finite-state machine, our architecture iteratively
identifies the minimum input value in each cycle without conventional
comparators. Synthesis results in a 45nm technology node demonstrate up to 82%
reduction in area and 70% reduction in power consumption compared to
state-of-the-art unary designs. The proposed sorter offers a promising solution
for energy-constrained and resource-limited hardware systems.

Abstract: The industrial market continuously needs reliable solutions to secure

interconnected, reliable security solutions are becoming increasingly
important. One promising solution to tackle this challenge is using smart
contracts designed to meet contractual conditions, avoid malicious errors,
secure exchanges, and minimize the need for reliable intermediaries. However,
smart contracts are immutable. Moreover, there are different smart contract
execution architectures (namely Order-Execute and Execute-Order-Validate) that
have different throughputs. In this study, we developed an evaluation model for
assessing the security of reliable smart contract execution. We then developed
a realistic smart contract enabled IoT energy case study. Finally, we simulate
the developed case study to evaluate several smart contract security

Abstract: Text watermarks in large language models (LLMs) are an increasingly important
tool for detecting synthetic text and distinguishing human-written content from
LLM-generated text. While most existing studies focus on determining whether
entire texts are watermarked, many real-world scenarios involve mixed-source
texts, which blend human-written and watermarked content. In this paper, we
address the problem of optimally estimating the watermark proportion in
mixed-source texts. We cast this problem as estimating the proportion parameter
in a mixture model based on \emph{pivotal statistics}. First, we show that this
parameter is not even identifiable in certain watermarking schemes, let alone
consistently estimable. In stark contrast, for watermarking methods that employ
continuous pivotal statistics for detection, we demonstrate that the proportion
parameter is identifiable under mild conditions. We propose efficient
estimators for this class of methods, which include several popular unbiased
watermarks as examples, and derive minimax lower bounds for any measurable
estimator based on pivotal statistics, showing that our estimators achieve
these lower bounds. Through evaluations on both synthetic data and mixed-source
text generated by open-source models, we demonstrate that our proposed
estimators consistently achieve high estimation accuracy.

### [195] [APO: Enhancing Reasoning Ability of MLLMs via Asymmetric Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21655)
*Minjie Hong,Zirun Guo,Yan Xia,Zehan Wang,Ziang Zhang,Tao Jin,Zhou Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Asymmetric Policy Optimization (APO)的方法，通过Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS)和Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR)技术，解决了多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在强化学习训练中的KL惩罚和过度思考问题，显著提升了推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，而强化学习(RL)的应用又容易导致性能下降或过度思考。本研究旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出APO方法，将样本分为正负两组：正样本采用DADS动态调整KL散度权重，负样本采用STCR惩罚过长响应。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B模型上应用该方法后，推理能力平均提升7%，优于更大的MLLMs，且不影响通用任务性能。

Conclusion: DADS和STCR技术有效提升了MLLMs的复杂推理能力，并保持了模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful at integrating diverse
data, but they often struggle with complex reasoning. While Reinforcement
learning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.
Common issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation
of overly detailed or "overthinking" reasoning. Our work investigates how the
KL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric
Policy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled
responses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,
Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically
adjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents
policy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes
samples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative
samples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to
penalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages
more concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We
apply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B
significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\% gain over
the base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning
benchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade
on general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating
superior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad
applicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal
reasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available at
https://github.com/Indolent-Kawhi/View-R1.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态控制连续归一化流（CNFs）和扩散模型（DMs）质量与复杂度权衡的方法，通过重连Transformer块并引入时间和长度一致性项，实现了采样时任意时间步和块数的灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注减少采样时间步以提高效率，但忽略了动态控制质量与复杂度的可能性。

Method: 通过重连Transformer块解决内部离散ODE，并在训练中引入时间和长度一致性项，实现采样时时间步和块数的动态控制。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ和ImageNet上的实验显示，最高效采样模式下延迟减少3倍，高质量采样时FID分数提升3.5分。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在时间维度和内存使用上均优于现有技术，且代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: Recently, continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and diffusion models (DMs) have
been studied using the unified theoretical framework. Although such models can
generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling
demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE)
with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the
number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this
work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity
tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length
of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the
transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its
length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow
matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an
arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our
$\textrm{ODE}_t \left(\textrm{ODE}_l \right)$ approach is solver-agnostic in
time dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the
previous state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and
ImageNet show a latency reduction of up to $3\times$ in the most efficient
sampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to $3.5$ points for
high-quality sampling. We release our code and model weights with fully
reproducible experiments.

Motivation: 解决交通模拟中手动驾驶数据有限的问题，通过生成式模拟城市环境，支持从起点到终点的无缝模拟。

Method: 提出SceneDiffuser++，一种基于单一损失函数的端到端生成世界模型，整合场景生成、动态代理行为建模等技术。

Result: 在增强版Waymo Open Motion Dataset上验证了SceneDiffuser++的城市规模模拟能力和长期模拟的真实性。

Conclusion: SceneDiffuser++首次实现了城市规模的端到端交通模拟，为自动驾驶测试提供了高效工具。

Abstract: The goal of traffic simulation is to augment a potentially limited amount of
manually-driven miles that is available for testing and validation, with a much
larger amount of simulated synthetic miles. The culmination of this vision
would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an
autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate
the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and
controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g.,
vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to
this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation
technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior
modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to
seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such
as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in
various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment
simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose
SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a
single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale
integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic
simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under
long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented
version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to
support trip-level simulation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GPAS的技术，用于解决Pre-LN Transformer中激活方差指数增长的问题，通过缩放中间激活值但保持梯度不变，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-LN Transformer在预训练中稳定且可扩展，但存在激活方差指数增长的问题，导致残差路径主导子层输出，限制了深层的学习能力。

Method: 提出Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS)，缩放中间激活值但保持梯度不变，避免梯度消失问题。

Result: 在71M到1B的不同模型规模上，GPAS均实现了性能提升，并适用于其他架构如Sandwich-LN和DeepNorm。

Conclusion: GPAS是一种简单有效的技术，能够改善Pre-LN Transformer的训练动态，并具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models, such as the LLaMA, Qwen and DeepSeek series,
predominantly adopt the Pre-LayerNorm (Pre-LN) Transformer architecture. While
being stable during pretraining and scalable to large model sizes, Pre-LN
suffers from an exponential growth in activation variance across layers,
causing the residual path to dominate over sub-layer outputs and limiting the
learning capacity of deeper layers. To mitigate this issue, we propose
Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS), a simple technique that can be
used in combination with existing approaches. GPAS works by scaling down the
intermediate activations while keeping their gradients unchanged. This leaves
information in the activations intact, and avoids the gradient vanishing
problem associated with gradient downscaling. Extensive experiments across
various model sizes from 71M to 1B show that GPAS achieves consistent
performance gains. Beyond enhancing Pre-LN Transformers, GPAS also shows
promise in improving alternative architectures such as Sandwich-LN and
DeepNorm, demonstrating its versatility and potential for improving training
dynamics in a wide range of settings.

*Erkan Turan,Aristotelis Siozopoulos,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Koopman算子理论的改进条件流匹配（CFM）方法，通过线性化生成动态实现高效采样，并提升模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CFM采样依赖非线性ODE求解，计算成本高且难以解释。本文旨在通过Koopman理论加速采样并揭示生成过程的结构。

Method: 结合Koopman算子理论，设计无解码器的Koopman-CFM架构，在学习的嵌入空间中实现线性动态，支持闭式单步采样。

Result: 在2D数据集和MNIST等基准测试中显著加速采样，同时通过Koopman生成器的谱特性分析生成行为。

Conclusion: Koopman增强的CFM在采样效率和可解释性上取得平衡，为快速且可分析的生成建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) offers a simulation-free framework for
training continuous-time generative models, bridging diffusion and flow-based
approaches. However, sampling from CFM still relies on numerically solving
non-linear ODEs which can be computationally expensive and difficult to
interpret. Recent alternatives address sampling speed via trajectory
straightening, mini-batch coupling or distillation. However, these methods
typically do not shed light on the underlying \textit{structure} of the
generative process. In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an
interpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator
theory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of
observables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns
an embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form,
one-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant
speedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and
real-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face
Dataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured
Koopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions
offer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal
scaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By
combining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow
matching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative
modeling.

Motivation: 探索LLM和智能体系统在药物发现中的模块化潜力，填补该领域研究空白。

Method: 比较不同LLM（如Claude-3.5-Sonnet、GPT-4o等）和代理类型（工具调用与代码生成）的性能，使用LLM-as-a-judge评分。

Result: Claude-3.5-Sonnet、Claude-3.7-Sonnet和GPT-4o表现优于其他模型；代码生成代理平均表现更好，但结果依赖具体问题和模型。

Conclusion: LLM替换需考虑提示重新设计，进一步研究智能体系统模块化对开发稳定、可扩展解决方案至关重要。

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems present exciting
opportunities to accelerate drug discovery and design. In this study, we
critically examine the modularity of LLM-based agentic systems for drug
discovery, i.e., whether parts of the agentic system such as the LLM are
interchangeable, a topic that has received limited attention in drug discovery
applications. We compare the performance of different large language models
(LLMs) and the effectiveness of tool-calling agents versus code-generating
agents in this domain. Our case study, comparing performance in orchestrating
tools for chemistry and drug discovery using an LLM-as-a-judge score, shows
that Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o outperform alternative
language models such as Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and
Nova-Micro. Although we confirm that code-generating agents outperform the
tool-calling ones on average, we show that this is highly question and model
dependent. Furthermore, the impact of replacing system prompts is dependent on
the specific question asked and the model used, underscoring that -- even in
this particular domain -- one cannot just replace language models without
considering prompt re-engineering. Our study highlights the necessity of
further research into the modularity of agentic systems to enable the
development of stable and scalable solutions for real-world problems.

Motivation: 大型语言模型规模增大导致推理时间和计算需求增加，因此需要有效的模型压缩方法。

Method: 训练可训练的投影权重，保留原始模型参数，并将投影合并为低维矩阵，生成压缩后的模型。

Result: 投影压缩在高质量模型上表现优于硬剪枝和再训练方法，且性能随token数量增加而提升。

Conclusion: 投影压缩是一种高效且计算开销低的模型压缩方法，适用于大规模语言模型。

Abstract: Large language models have steadily increased in size to achieve improved
performance; however, this growth has also led to greater inference time and
computational demands. Consequently, there is rising interest in model size
reduction methods. To address this issue, we propose Projected Compression, a
novel model compression technique, that reduces model weights by utilizing
projection modules. Specifically, we first train additional trainable
projections weights and preserve access to all the original model parameters.
Subsequently, these projections are merged into a lower-dimensional product
matrix, resulting in a reduced-size standard Transformer-based model. Unlike
alternative approaches that require additional computational overhead, our
method matches the base model's per-token computation step in FLOPs.
Experimental results show that Projected Compression outperforms the comparable
hard pruning and retraining approach on higher quality models. Moreover, the
performance margin scales well with the number of tokens.

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，OptScale显著减少采样开销，性能优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: 提供了推理扩展的理论基础和实用解决方案，优化了LLM在复杂推理中的高效部署。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the
reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing
approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a
principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic
framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the
assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed
(i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability
distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a
theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target
performance level, providing the first principled guidance for
compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop
\textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the
optimal number of sampled responses. \textsc{OptScale} employs a language
model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the
decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined
performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC)
demonstrate that \textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead
while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance.
Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for
principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient
deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.

Result: 在ViDoRe和SEC-Filings数据集上，HPC-ColPali降低了30-50%的查询延迟，同时保持高检索精度；在检索增强生成管道中，幻觉率降低30%，端到端延迟减半。

Conclusion: HPC-ColPali为多向量文档检索提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-vector document retrieval systems, such as ColPali, excel in
fine-grained matching for complex queries but incur significant storage and
computational costs due to their reliance on high-dimensional patch embeddings
and late-interaction scoring. To address these challenges, we propose
HPC-ColPali, a Hierarchical Patch Compression framework that enhances the
efficiency of ColPali while preserving its retrieval accuracy. Our approach
integrates three innovative techniques: (1) K-Means quantization, which
compresses patch embeddings into 1-byte centroid indices, achieving up to
32$\times$ storage reduction; (2) attention-guided dynamic pruning, utilizing
Vision-Language Model attention weights to retain only the top-$p\%$ most
salient patches, reducing late-interaction computation by up to 60\% with less
than 2\% nDCG@10 loss; and (3) optional binary encoding of centroid indices
into $b$-bit strings ($b=\lceil\log_2 K\rceil$), enabling rapid Hamming
distance-based similarity search for resource-constrained environments.
Evaluated on the ViDoRe and SEC-Filings datasets, HPC-ColPali achieves 30--50\%
lower query latency under HNSW indexing while maintaining high retrieval
precision. When integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline for
legal summarization, it reduces hallucination rates by 30\% and halves
end-to-end latency. These advancements establish HPC-ColPali as a scalable and
efficient solution for multi-vector document retrieval across diverse
applications. Code is available at https://github.com/DngBack/HPC-ColPali.

Conclusion: 检索增强与多步代理推理结合为自动化布局生成提供了可扩展、可解释且高保真的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated content-aware layout generation -- the task of arranging visual
elements such as text, logos, and underlays on a background canvas -- remains a
fundamental yet under-explored problem in intelligent design systems. While
recent advances in deep generative models and large language models (LLMs) have
shown promise in structured content generation, most existing approaches lack
grounding in contextual design exemplars and fall short in handling semantic
alignment and visual coherence. In this work we introduce CAL-RAG, a
retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for content-aware layout generation that
integrates multimodal retrieval, large language models, and collaborative
agentic reasoning. Our system retrieves relevant layout examples from a
structured knowledge base and invokes an LLM-based layout recommender to
propose structured element placements. A vision-language grader agent evaluates
the layout with visual metrics, and a feedback agent provides targeted
refinements, enabling iterative improvement. We implement our framework using
LangGraph and evaluate it on the PKU PosterLayout dataset, a benchmark rich in
semantic and structural variability. CAL-RAG achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple layout metrics -- including underlay effectiveness,
element alignment, and overlap -- substantially outperforming strong baselines
such as LayoutPrompter. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval
augmentation with agentic multi-step reasoning yields a scalable,
interpretable, and high-fidelity solution for automated layout generation.

Motivation: 尽管混合检索方法在性能上有提升，但在中文检索中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: HyReC结合语义联合表示模型、GLAE编码器和归一化模块，优化混合检索。

Result: 在C-MTEB基准测试中验证了HyReC的有效性。

Conclusion: HyReC为中文混合检索提供了一种有效的端到端优化方法。

Abstract: Hybrid-based retrieval methods, which unify dense-vector and lexicon-based
retrieval, have garnered considerable attention in the industry due to
performance enhancement. However, despite their promising results, the
application of these hybrid paradigms in Chinese retrieval contexts has
remained largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce HyReC, an
innovative end-to-end optimization method tailored specifically for
hybrid-based retrieval in Chinese. HyReC enhances performance by integrating
the semantic union of terms into the representation model. Additionally, it
features the Global-Local-Aware Encoder (GLAE) to promote consistent semantic
sharing between lexicon-based and dense retrieval while minimizing the
interference between them. To further refine alignment, we incorporate a
Normalization Module (NM) that fosters mutual benefits between the retrieval
approaches. Finally, we evaluate HyReC on the C-MTEB retrieval benchmark to
demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: ARAG框架通过多智能体协作机制改进RAG，显著提升推荐系统的个性化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法依赖静态检索启发式，难以捕捉动态推荐场景中的用户偏好。

Method: ARAG引入四个LLM智能体：用户理解、自然语言推理、上下文总结和项目排序，优化推荐流程。

Result: 在三个数据集上，ARAG在NDCG@5和Hit@5上分别提升42.1%和35.5%。

Conclusion: 智能体推理与RAG结合有效，为LLM个性化推荐提供新方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing
recommendation systems by incorporating external context into large language
model prompts. However, existing RAG-based approaches often rely on static
retrieval heuristics and fail to capture nuanced user preferences in dynamic
recommendation scenarios. In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic
Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which
integrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To
better understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG
leverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that
summarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural
Language Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between
candidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent
that summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that
generates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate
ARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG
significantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving
up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5. We also, conduct an
ablation study to analyse the effect by different components of ARAG. Our
findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating agentic reasoning into
retrieval-augmented recommendation and provide new directions for LLM-based
personalization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的性别偏见检测方法，并引入新的公平性指标CWEx，以改进现有方法的局限性。实验表明CWEx能更细致地评估公平性，并与人工标注更一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NLP和IR系统中存在的性别偏见问题，改进现有偏见检测方法的不足。

Method: 利用LLM检测和测量段落排序中的性别偏见，提出新的公平性指标CWEx，并在MS MARCO数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: CWEx比现有指标更细致地评估公平性，与人工标注的一致性更高（Cohen's Kappa分别为58.77%和18.51%）。

Conclusion: 通过LLM驱动的偏见检测和改进的公平性指标，为IR系统提供了更鲁棒的偏见分析和缓解框架。

Abstract: The presence of social biases in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
Information Retrieval (IR) systems is an ongoing challenge, which underlines
the importance of developing robust approaches to identifying and evaluating
such biases. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) to detect and measure gender bias in passage ranking.
Existing gender fairness metrics rely on lexical- and frequency-based measures,
leading to various limitations, e.g., missing subtle gender disparities.
Building on our LLM-based gender bias detection method, we introduce a novel
gender fairness metric, named Class-wise Weighted Exposure (CWEx), aiming to
address existing limitations. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed
metric and study LLMs' effectiveness in detecting gender bias, we annotate a
subset of the MS MARCO Passage Ranking collection and release our new gender
bias collection, called MSMGenderBias, to foster future research in this area.
Our extensive experimental results on various ranking models show that our
proposed metric offers a more detailed evaluation of fairness compared to
previous metrics, with improved alignment to human labels (58.77% for
Grep-BiasIR, and 18.51% for MSMGenderBias, measured using Cohen's Kappa
agreement), effectively distinguishing gender bias in ranking. By integrating
LLM-driven bias detection, an improved fairness metric, and gender bias
annotations for an established dataset, this work provides a more robust
framework for analyzing and mitigating bias in IR systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自主机器人在非结构化户外环境中检测可通行路径的难题，特别是在搜索救援和森林火灾等关键场景中的应用。

Method: 提出TOMD数据集，包含多模态传感器数据，并设计动态多尺度数据融合模型，分析不同融合策略和光照条件的影响。

Result: 结果表明该方法有效，且光照对分割性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: TOMD数据集和提出的模型为非结构化户外环境导航研究提供了支持，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: Detecting traversable pathways in unstructured outdoor environments remains a
significant challenge for autonomous robots, especially in critical
applications such as wide-area search and rescue, as well as incident
management scenarios like forest fires. Existing datasets and models primarily
target urban settings or wide, vehicle-traversable off-road tracks, leaving a
substantial gap in addressing the complexity of narrow, trail-like off-road
scenarios. To address this, we introduce the Trail-based Off-road Multimodal
Dataset (TOMD), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for such
environments. TOMD features high-fidelity multimodal sensor data -- including
128-channel LiDAR, stereo imagery, GNSS, IMU, and illumination measurements --
collected through repeated traversals under diverse conditions. We also propose
a dynamic multiscale data fusion model for accurate traversable pathway
prediction. The study analyzes the performance of early, cross, and mixed
fusion strategies under varying illumination levels. Results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach and the relevance of illumination in segmentation
performance. We publicly release TOMD at https://github.com/yyyxs1125/TMOD to
support future research in trail-based off-road navigation.

Method: 提出AeroLite-MDNet模型，结合多尺度融合模块和分割分支，用于偏差检测和方向估计；引入AWD指标和新数据集UAVLandData。

Result: 系统AWD为0.7秒，偏差检测准确率达98.6%，显著提升着陆可靠性。

Conclusion: AeroLite-MDNet系统有效解决了无人机着陆偏差问题，实验验证了其高性能和实用性。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly employed in diverse
applications such as land surveying, material transport, and environmental
monitoring. Following missions like data collection or inspection, UAVs must
land safely at docking stations for storage or recharging, which is an
essential requirement for ensuring operational continuity. However, accurate
landing remains challenging due to factors like GPS signal interference. To
address this issue, we propose a deviation warning system for UAV landings,
powered by a novel vision-based model called AeroLite-MDNet. This model
integrates a multiscale fusion module for robust cross-scale object detection
and incorporates a segmentation branch for efficient orientation estimation. We
introduce a new evaluation metric, Average Warning Delay (AWD), to quantify the
system's sensitivity to landing deviations. Furthermore, we contribute a new
dataset, UAVLandData, which captures real-world landing deviation scenarios to
support training and evaluation. Experimental results show that our system
achieves an AWD of 0.7 seconds with a deviation detection accuracy of 98.6\%,
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing UAV landing reliability. Code will

Result: 通过大量仿真和硬件评估，证明了该方法在性能上显著优于现有文献。

Conclusion: 该方法为滑移转向车辆的自动化提供了一种有效的解决方案，尤其在动态操作中表现优异。

Abstract: Vision-based lane keeping is a topic of significant interest in the robotics
and autonomous ground vehicles communities in various on-road and off-road
applications. The skid-steered vehicle architecture has served as a useful
vehicle platform for human controlled operations. However, systematic modeling,
especially of the skid-slip wheel terrain interactions (primarily in off-road
settings) has created bottlenecks for automation deployment. End-to-end
learning based methods such as imitation learning and deep reinforcement
learning, have gained prominence as a viable deployment option to counter the
lack of accurate analytical models. However, the systematic formulation and
subsequent verification/validation in dynamic operation regimes (particularly
for skid-steered vehicles) remains a work in progress. To this end, a novel
approach for structured formulation for learning visual navigation is proposed
and investigated in this work. Extensive software simulations, hardware
evaluations and ablation studies now highlight the significantly improved
performance of the proposed approach against contemporary literature.

Abstract: Mobile robots rely on object detectors for perception and object localization
in indoor environments. However, standard closed-set methods struggle to handle
the diverse objects and dynamic conditions encountered in real homes and labs.
Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), driven by Vision Language Models
(VLMs), extends beyond fixed labels but still struggles with domain shifts in
indoor environments. We introduce a Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA)
approach that adapts a pre-trained model without accessing source data. We
refine pseudo labels via temporal clustering, employ multi-scale threshold
fusion, and apply a Mean Teacher framework with contrastive learning. Our
Embodied Domain Adaptation for Object Detection (EDAOD) benchmark evaluates
adaptation under sequential changes in lighting, layout, and object diversity.
Our experiments show significant gains in zero-shot detection performance and
flexible adaptation to dynamic indoor conditions.

(DLO) knot tying that is robust to occlusion, repeatable for varying rope
initial configurations, interpretable for generating motion policies, and
requires no human demonstrations or training. Grasp and target waypoints for
future DLO states are planned from the current DLO shape. Grasp poses are
computed from indexing the tracked piecewise linear curve representing the DLO
state based on the current curve shape and are piecewise continuous. KnotDLO
computes intermediate waypoints from the geometry of the current DLO state and
the desired next state. The system decouples visual reasoning from control. In
16 trials of knot tying, KnotDLO achieves a 50% success rate in tying an
overhand knot from previously unseen configurations.

Result: 摘要可读性逐年下降，ChatGPT发布后2023年和2024年变化显著。

Conclusion: AI可能影响了科学写作的可读性，导致摘要变得更复杂。

Abstract: The rise and growing popularity of accessible large language models have
raised questions about their impact on various aspects of life, including how
scientists write and publish their research. The primary objective of this
paper is to analyze a dataset consisting of all abstracts posted on arXiv.org
between 2010 and June 7th, 2024, to assess the evolution of their readability
and determine whether significant shifts occurred following the release of
ChatGPT in November 2022. Four standard readability formulas are used to
calculate individual readability scores for each paper, classifying their level
of readability. These scores are then aggregated by year and across the eight
primary categories covered by the platform. The results show a steady annual
decrease in readability, suggesting that abstracts are likely becoming
increasingly complex. Additionally, following the release of ChatGPT, a
significant change in readability is observed for 2023 and the analyzed months
of 2024. Similar trends are found across categories, with most experiencing a
notable change in readability during 2023 and 2024. These findings offer
insights into the broader changes in readability and point to the likely

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态分块自回归合成框架（DCAR），通过动态调整预测范围，显著提升了语音合成的效率和清晰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归语音合成模型在处理长语音序列时存在注意力不稳定、延迟高和合成质量下降的问题，限制了实时应用的可行性。

Method: DCAR引入了分块到帧的注意力机制，通过多令牌预测训练，动态调整预测范围，减少序列长度依赖。

Result: 实验表明，DCAR在测试集上实现了72.27%的清晰度提升和2.61倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: DCAR为下一代语音合成系统提供了高效且鲁棒的基础框架。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) language models have emerged as a dominant
approach in speech synthesis, offering expressive generation and scalable
training. However, conventional AR speech synthesis models relying on the
next-token prediction paradigm often encounter significant challenges when
handling long speech sequences. These models often struggle to construct stable
frame-to-frame attention, leading to increased latency and degraded synthesis
quality, thereby limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we introduce a novel dynamic chunk-wise
autoregressive synthesis framework, termed DCAR, designed to enhance both
efficiency and intelligibility robustness in AR speech generation. DCAR
introduces a chunk-to-frame attention mechanism through training with
multi-token prediction, enabling dynamic chunk prediction in variable speech
contexts using a lightweight module trained on-policy. DCAR dynamically adjusts
the token prediction span, significantly reducing the sequence length
dependency while obtaining high synthesis quality. Comprehensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that DCAR substantially outperforms traditional
next-token prediction models, achieving up to 72.27% intelligibility
improvement and 2.61x inference speedup simultaneously on the test set.
Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive analysis to support it as a versatile
foundation for next-generation speech synthesis systems.

Result: 模型对齐准确率比DTW方法高20%，结合DTW后进一步提升了鲁棒性和一致性。

Conclusion: 神经网络在MIDI与音频对齐任务中具有潜力，可推动该领域的技术进步。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural network approach for synchronizing audio
recordings of human piano performances with their corresponding loosely aligned
MIDI files. The task is addressed using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural
Network (CRNN) architecture, which effectively captures spectral and temporal
features by processing an unaligned piano roll and a spectrogram as inputs to
estimate the aligned piano roll. To train the network, we create a dataset of
piano pieces with augmented MIDI files that simulate common human timing
errors. The proposed model achieves up to 20% higher alignment accuracy than
the industry-standard Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method across various
tolerance windows. Furthermore, integrating DTW with the CRNN yields additional
improvements, offering enhanced robustness and consistency. These findings
demonstrate the potential of neural networks in advancing state-of-the-art
MIDI-to-audio alignment.

Conclusion: CitySim是一个可扩展、灵活的测试平台，适用于理解和预测城市现象。

Abstract: Modeling human behavior in urban environments is fundamental for social
science, behavioral studies, and urban planning. Prior work often rely on
rigid, hand-crafted rules, limiting their ability to simulate nuanced
intentions, plans, and adaptive behaviors. Addressing these challenges, we
envision an urban simulator (CitySim), capitalizing on breakthroughs in
human-level intelligence exhibited by large language models. In CitySim, agents
generate realistic daily schedules using a recursive value-driven approach that
balances mandatory activities, personal habits, and situational factors. To
enable long-term, lifelike simulations, we endow agents with beliefs, long-term
goals, and spatial memory for navigation. CitySim exhibits closer alignment
with real humans than prior work, both at micro and macro levels. Additionally,
we conduct insightful experiments by modeling tens of thousands of agents and
evaluating their collective behaviors under various real-world scenarios,
including estimating crowd density, predicting place popularity, and assessing
well-being. Our results highlight CitySim as a scalable, flexible testbed for

Abstract: The vast growth of data has rendered traditional manual inspection
infeasible, necessitating the adoption of computational methods for efficient
data exploration. Topic modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing
large-scale textual datasets, enabling the extraction of latent semantic
structures. However, existing methods for topic modeling often struggle to
provide interpretable representations that facilitate deeper insights into data
structure and content. In this paper, we propose FAT-CAT, an approach based on
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to enhance meaningful topic aggregation and
visualization of discovered topics. Our approach can handle diverse topics and
file types -- grouped by directories -- to construct a concept lattice that
offers a structured, hierarchical representation of their topic distribution.
In a case study on the ETYNTKE dataset, we evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach against other representation methods to demonstrate that FCA-based
aggregation provides more meaningful and interpretable insights into dataset
composition than existing topic modeling techniques.

Method: 利用NanoGPT速度跑分竞赛的19个任务，提供不同格式的提示，测试LLM复现改进的能力。

Result: 前沿LLM结合先进脚手架仍难以复现已知创新，表明科学复现能力有限。

Conclusion: 该基准为衡量LLM自动化科学复现能力提供了简单且未饱和的评估工具。

Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to
assist in scientific progress. A critical capability toward this endeavor is
the ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to
reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM
Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the
NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time.
Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records
training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from
pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records
execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse
code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to
hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible
and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that
recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement
already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our
benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to
automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an
autonomous research agent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs在表达复杂函数方面表现出色，但其在量子机器学习中的应用尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM)实现了KAN的混合和全量子形式，利用预训练残差函数进行迁移。

Result: 展示了QuKAN的可行性、可解释性和性能。

Conclusion: QuKAN为量子机器学习提供了一种新的有效架构。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), built upon the Kolmogorov Arnold
representation theorem (KAR), have demonstrated promising capabilities in
expressing complex functions with fewer neurons. This is achieved by
implementing learnable parameters on the edges instead of on the nodes, unlike
traditional networks such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, KANs
potential in quantum machine learning has not yet been well explored. In this
work, we present an implementation of these KAN architectures in both hybrid
and fully quantum forms using a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM). We adapt
the KAN transfer using pre-trained residual functions, thereby exploiting the
representational power of parametrized quantum circuits. In the hybrid model we
combine classical KAN components with quantum subroutines, while the fully
quantum version the entire architecture of the residual function is translated
to a quantum model. We demonstrate the feasibility, interpretability and
performance of the proposed Quantum KAN (QuKAN) architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超表面的逆向设计因结构与光学特性之间的复杂非线性关系而具有挑战性，传统方法需要专家调参且易陷入局部最优。

Method: 通过结合扩散模型和RCWA模拟器生成训练数据，训练条件扩散模型以预测目标光学响应对应的超表面几何结构。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动的超表面设计提供了高效工具，并公开了代码和数据集以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Metasurfaces are ultra-thin optical elements composed of engineered
sub-wavelength structures that enable precise control of light. Their inverse
design - determining a geometry that yields a desired optical response - is
challenging due to the complex, nonlinear relationship between structure and
optical properties. This often requires expert tuning, is prone to local
minima, and involves significant computational overhead. In this work, we
address these challenges by integrating the generative capabilities of
diffusion models into computational design workflows. Using an RCWA simulator,
we generate training data consisting of metasurface geometries and their
corresponding far-field scattering patterns. We then train a conditional
diffusion model to predict meta-atom geometry and height from a target spatial
power distribution at a specified wavelength, sampled from a continuous
supported band. Once trained, the model can generate metasurfaces with low
error, either directly using RCWA-guided posterior sampling or by serving as an
initializer for traditional optimization methods. We demonstrate our approach
on the design of a spatially uniform intensity splitter and a polarization beam
splitter, both produced with low error in under 30 minutes. To support further
research in data-driven metasurface design, we publicly release our code and
datasets.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）为贝叶斯统计选择先验分布的方法，评估了Claude、Gemini和ChatGPT在真实数据集上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯统计中选择先验分布具有挑战性且主观性强，研究旨在利用LLMs提供高效、客观的先验建议。

Method: 通过设计详细的提示词，要求LLMs不仅建议先验分布，还验证和反思其选择，并在心脏疾病风险和混凝土强度数据集上评估模型表现。

Result: LLMs能正确识别关联方向，但中等信息先验常过于自信，Claude和Gemini表现优于ChatGPT。弱信息先验中，Claude避免了不必要的模糊性。

Conclusion: LLMs在高效、客观地生成信息性先验方面潜力巨大，但需校准先验宽度以避免过度自信或不足。

Abstract: Selecting prior distributions in Bayesian statistics is challenging,
resource-intensive, and subjective. We analyze using large-language models
(LLMs) to suggest suitable, knowledge-based informative priors. We developed an
extensive prompt asking LLMs not only to suggest priors but also to verify and
reflect on their choices.
  We evaluated Claude Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and ChatGPT-4o-mini on two real
datasets: heart disease risk and concrete strength. All LLMs correctly
identified the direction for all associations (e.g., that heart disease risk is
higher for males). The quality of suggested priors was measured by their
Kullback-Leibler divergence from the maximum likelihood estimator's
distribution.
  The LLMs suggested both moderately and weakly informative priors. The
moderate priors were often overconfident, resulting in distributions misaligned
with the data. In our experiments, Claude and Gemini provided better priors
than ChatGPT. For weakly informative priors, a key performance difference
emerged: ChatGPT and Gemini defaulted to an "unnecessarily vague" mean of 0,
while Claude did not, demonstrating a significant advantage.
  The ability of LLMs to identify correct associations shows their great
potential as an efficient, objective method for developing informative priors.
However, the primary challenge remains in calibrating the width of these priors
to avoid over- and under-confidence.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出PhotonSplat框架，利用SPAD阵列解决运动模糊问题，实现高质量3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染技术在输入图像因运动模糊而损坏时表现不佳，SPAD阵列虽能高速成像但面临二进制图像噪声问题。

Method: 引入PhotonSplat框架，结合3D空间滤波技术，支持无参考生成和有参考着色，适用于动态场景。

Result: 成功从SPAD二进制图像重建3D场景，并贡献了PhotonScenes数据集。

Conclusion: PhotonSplat有效解决了噪声与模糊的权衡问题，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction using neural rendering have enabled
high-quality 3D capture. However, they often fail when the input imagery is
corrupted by motion blur, due to fast motion of the camera or the objects in
the scene. This work advances neural rendering techniques in such scenarios by
using single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays, an emerging sensing
technology capable of sensing images at extremely high speeds. However, the use
of SPADs presents its own set of unique challenges in the form of binary
images, that are driven by stochastic photon arrivals. To address this, we
introduce PhotonSplat, a framework designed to reconstruct 3D scenes directly
from SPAD binary images, effectively navigating the noise vs. blur trade-off.
Our approach incorporates a novel 3D spatial filtering technique to reduce
noise in the renderings. The framework also supports both no-reference using
generative priors and reference-based colorization from a single blurry image,
enabling downstream applications such as segmentation, object detection and
appearance editing tasks. Additionally, we extend our method to incorporate
dynamic scene representations, making it suitable for scenes with moving
objects. We further contribute PhotonScenes, a real-world multi-view dataset
captured with the SPAD sensors.

Abstract: Trackerless freehand ultrasound reconstruction aims to reconstruct 3D volumes
from sequences of 2D ultrasound images without relying on external tracking
systems, offering a low-cost, portable, and widely deployable alternative for
volumetric imaging. However, it presents significant challenges, including
accurate inter-frame motion estimation, minimisation of drift accumulation over
long sequences, and generalisability across scanning protocols. The TUS-REC2024
Challenge was established to benchmark and accelerate progress in trackerless
3D ultrasound reconstruction by providing a publicly available dataset for the
first time, along with a baseline model and evaluation framework. The Challenge
attracted over 43 registered teams, of which 6 teams submitted 21 valid
dockerized solutions. Submitted methods spanned a wide range of algorithmic
approaches, including recurrent models, registration-driven volume refinement,
attention, and physics-informed models. This paper presents an overview of the
Challenge design, summarises the key characteristics of the dataset, provides a
concise literature review, introduces the technical details of the underlying
methodology working with tracked freehand ultrasound data, and offers a
comparative analysis of submitted methods across multiple evaluation metrics.
The results highlight both the progress and current limitations of
state-of-the-art approaches in this domain, and inform directions for future
research. The data, evaluation code, and baseline are publicly available to
facilitate ongoing development and reproducibility. As a live and evolving
benchmark, this Challenge is designed to be continuously developed and
improved. The Challenge was held at MICCAI 2024 and will be organised again at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理模型和深度学习的干涉高光谱成像（IHI）重建方法，解决了训练数据不足和IHI特有退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IHI在遥感任务中具有优势，但受限于成像误差和现有信号处理算法的性能。缺乏训练数据和难以消除IHI特有退化是主要挑战。

Method: 1) 基于成像物理和辐射校准数据建立IHI退化模型，合成训练数据；2) 设计IHRUT模型，通过条纹增强和空间-光谱变换器实现重建。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能和泛化能力上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了IHI重建中的关键问题，为深度学习在IHI中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Interferometric Hyperspectral Imaging (IHI) is a critical technique for
large-scale remote sensing tasks due to its advantages in flux and spectral
resolution. However, IHI is susceptible to complex errors arising from imaging
steps, and its quality is limited by existing signal processing-based
reconstruction algorithms. Two key challenges hinder performance enhancement:
1) the lack of training datasets. 2) the difficulty in eliminating IHI-specific
degradation components through learning-based methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel IHI reconstruction pipeline. First, based on
imaging physics and radiometric calibration data, we establish a simplified yet
accurate IHI degradation model and a parameter estimation method. This model
enables the synthesis of realistic IHI training datasets from hyperspectral
images (HSIs), bridging the gap between IHI reconstruction and deep learning.
Second, we design the Interferometric Hyperspectral Reconstruction Unfolding
Transformer (IHRUT), which achieves effective spectral correction and detail
restoration through a stripe-pattern enhancement mechanism and a
spatial-spectral transformer architecture. Experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance and generalization capability of our method.

TL;DR: UnMix-NeRF结合光谱解混技术，实现了基于NeRF的高光谱新视角合成和无监督材料分割，解决了现有方法缺乏材料属性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF分割方法仅依赖RGB数据，缺乏材料属性信息，限制了在机器人、增强现实等应用中的准确材料感知。

Method: 通过建模光谱反射率（漫反射和镜面反射），利用全局端元字典和逐点丰度分布，实现高光谱合成和无监督材料分割。

Result: 实验表明，UnMix-NeRF在光谱重建和材料分割上优于现有方法，并支持基于材料的场景编辑。

Conclusion: UnMix-NeRF为NeRF引入了材料感知能力，拓展了其在多领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object
semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties.
This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for
robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce
UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling
joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material
segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular
components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure
material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For
material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned
endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF
enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible
material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our
approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material
segmentation to existing methods. Project page:

TL;DR: StableCodec提出了一种一步扩散方法，用于超低比特率图像压缩，结合高效编码和双分支结构，显著提升了重建质量和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在超低比特率下需要大量去噪步骤，且难以保证像素级一致性，限制了实时应用。

Method: 开发了高效的深度压缩潜在编解码器，并采用双分支编码结构和端到端优化。

Result: 在多个数据集上，StableCodec在FID、KID和DISTS指标上显著优于现有方法，比特率低至0.005 bpp。

Conclusion: StableCodec在超低比特率下实现了高保真和高真实感，同时推理速度接近主流变换编码方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has shown remarkable potential for
achieving ultra-low bitrate coding (less than 0.05 bits per pixel) with high
realism, by leveraging the generative priors of large pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, current approaches require a large number of
denoising steps at the decoder to generate realistic results under extreme
bitrate constraints, limiting their application in real-time compression
scenarios. Additionally, these methods often sacrifice reconstruction fidelity,
as diffusion models typically fail to guarantee pixel-level consistency. To
address these challenges, we introduce StableCodec, which enables one-step
diffusion for high-fidelity and high-realism extreme image compression with
improved coding efficiency. To achieve ultra-low bitrates, we first develop an
efficient Deep Compression Latent Codec to transmit a noisy latent
representation for a single-step denoising process. We then propose a
Dual-Branch Coding Structure, consisting of a pair of auxiliary encoder and
decoder, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we adopt end-to-end
optimization with joint bitrate and pixel-level constraints. Extensive
experiments on the CLIC 2020, DIV2K, and Kodak dataset demonstrate that
StableCodec outperforms existing methods in terms of FID, KID and DISTS by a
significant margin, even at bitrates as low as 0.005 bits per pixel, while
maintaining strong fidelity. Additionally, StableCodec achieves inference
speeds comparable to mainstream transform coding schemes. All source code are

Result: NEED在重建和泛化性能上优于现有方法，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: NEED仅需正常剂量数据训练，可泛化至多种未见剂量水平，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The generalization of deep learning-based low-dose computed tomography (CT)
reconstruction models to doses unseen in the training data is important and
remains challenging. Previous efforts heavily rely on paired data to improve
the generalization performance and robustness through collecting either diverse
CT data for re-training or a few test data for fine-tuning. Recently, diffusion
models have shown promising and generalizable performance in low-dose CT (LDCT)
reconstruction, however, they may produce unrealistic structures due to the CT
image noise deviating from Gaussian distribution and imprecise prior
information from the guidance of noisy LDCT images. In this paper, we propose a
noise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable LDCT reconstruction, termed
NEED, which tailors diffusion models for noise characteristics of each domain.
First, we propose a novel shifted Poisson diffusion model to denoise projection
data, which aligns the diffusion process with the noise model in pre-log LDCT
projections. Second, we devise a doubly guided diffusion model to refine
reconstructed images, which leverages LDCT images and initial reconstructions
to more accurately locate prior information and enhance reconstruction
fidelity. By cascading these two diffusion models for dual-domain
reconstruction, our NEED requires only normal-dose data for training and can be
effectively extended to various unseen dose levels during testing via a time
step matching strategy. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and
segmentation-based evaluations on two datasets demonstrate that our NEED
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and
generalization performance. Source code is made available at

Motivation: 现有方法在处理缺失模态和整合解剖定位方面缺乏灵活性，因此需要一种更灵活且高效的方法。

Method: 使用深度学习框架，评估了四种输入配置（FLAIR-only、T1-only、FLAIR和T1拼接、模态可互换设置），并引入多任务模型联合预测病变和解剖区域掩码。

Result: 多模态输入显著提升了分割性能，而模态可互换设置牺牲了准确性但提高了鲁棒性。多任务学习效果不如单独模型。

Conclusion: 多模态融合对WMH分析具有重要价值，联合建模在集成预测方面具有潜力。

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are radiological markers of small vessel
disease and neurodegeneration, whose accurate segmentation and spatial
localization are crucial for diagnosis and monitoring. While multimodal MRI
offers complementary contrasts for detecting and contextualizing WM lesions,
existing approaches often lack flexibility in handling missing modalities and
fail to integrate anatomical localization efficiently. We propose a deep
learning framework for WM lesion segmentation and localization that operates
directly in native space using single- and multi-modal MRI inputs. Our study
evaluates four input configurations: FLAIR-only, T1-only, concatenated FLAIR
and T1, and a modality-interchangeable setup. It further introduces a
multi-task model for jointly predicting lesion and anatomical region masks to
estimate region-wise lesion burden. Experiments conducted on the MICCAI WMH
Segmentation Challenge dataset demonstrate that multimodal input significantly
improves the segmentation performance, outperforming unimodal models. While the
modality-interchangeable setting trades accuracy for robustness, it enables
inference in cases with missing modalities. Joint lesion-region segmentation
using multi-task learning was less effective than separate models, suggesting
representational conflict between tasks. Our findings highlight the utility of
multimodal fusion for accurate and robust WMH analysis, and the potential of
joint modeling for integrated predictions.

Result: 在ASOCA数据集上，该方法分类准确率达87.50%，优于直接使用原始CT图像的模型（67.50%）。

Conclusion: 通过分解流程并提取可解释特征，显著提升了CVD分类的准确性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Automatic detection and classification of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) from
Computed Tomography (CT) images play an important part in facilitating
better-informed clinical decisions. However, most of the recent deep learning
based methods either directly work on raw CT data or utilize it in pair with
anatomical cardiac structure segmentation by training an end-to-end classifier.
As such, these approaches become much more difficult to interpret from a
clinical perspective. To address this challenge, in this work, we break down
the CVD classification pipeline into three components: (i) image segmentation,
(ii) image registration, and (iii) downstream CVD classification. Specifically,
we utilize the Atlas-ISTN framework and recent segmentation foundational models
to generate anatomical structure segmentation and a normative healthy atlas.
These are further utilized to extract clinically interpretable radiomic
features as well as deformation field based geometric features (through atlas
registration) for CVD classification. Our experiments on the publicly available
ASOCA dataset show that utilizing these features leads to better CVD
classification accuracy (87.50\%) when compared against classification model
trained directly on raw CT images (67.50\%). Our code is publicly available:

Motivation: 动态CBCT重建中，现有4DGS方法计算成本高且缺乏运动一致性，需要改进。

Method: 引入FFD空间基函数和变形感知框架，统一变形场下耦合高斯均位、尺度和旋转的时序演化。

Result: 在六个CBCT数据集上验证，图像质量优于HexPlane，速度提升6倍。

Conclusion: 变形感知4DGS为高效、运动补偿的CBCT重建提供了潜力。

Abstract: 3D Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in radiotherapy but suffers from motion
artifacts due to breathing. A common clinical approach mitigates this by
sorting projections into respiratory phases and reconstructing images per
phase, but this does not account for breathing variability. Dynamic CBCT
instead reconstructs images at each projection, capturing continuous motion
without phase sorting. Recent advancements in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS)
offer powerful tools for modeling dynamic scenes, yet their application to
dynamic CBCT remains underexplored. Existing 4DGS methods, such as HexPlane,
use implicit motion representations, which are computationally expensive. While
explicit low-rank motion models have been proposed, they lack spatial
regularization, leading to inconsistencies in Gaussian motion. To address these
limitations, we introduce a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis
function and a deformation-informed framework that enforces consistency by
coupling the temporal evolution of Gaussian's mean position, scale, and
rotation under a unified deformation field. We evaluate our approach on six
CBCT datasets, demonstrating superior image quality with a 6x speedup over
HexPlane. These results highlight the potential of deformation-informed 4DGS
for efficient, motion-compensated CBCT reconstruction. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HazeMatching的新方法，用于平衡荧光显微镜图像去雾任务中的保真度和真实感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在去雾任务中无法同时兼顾数据保真度和视觉真实感的问题。

Method: 采用条件流匹配框架，通过引导生成过程实现平衡。

Result: 在5个数据集上优于7个基线方法，实现了保真度与真实感的平衡。

Conclusion: HazeMatching无需显式退化算子，适用于真实显微镜数据，且结果校准良好。

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life
sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering
out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as
widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.
Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to
cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off
tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high
PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.
Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or
produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In
this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light
microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to
find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the
realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the
conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a
hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on
5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion
and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a
consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with
calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated
predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation
operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All
data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available
under a permissive license.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于全局复位释放（GRR）快门模式的单次曝光HDR成像方法，通过光学随机排列和优化问题解决高光区域问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多曝光HDR方法在动态场景中易产生运动伪影，而现有单次曝光方法难以处理高光区域。

Method: 利用GRR快门模式和随机排列的光学系统，结合总变分图像先验，通过优化问题恢复HDR数据。

Result: 仿真中，该方法在高像素饱和（10%以上）时优于其他单次曝光方法，并在实际原型中实现73dB动态范围。

Conclusion: 该方法通过GRR快门和光学随机排列，有效解决了单次曝光HDR成像中的高光区域问题。

Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the
dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple
exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging
dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR
data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many
established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image
detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize
the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR
shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the
sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the
sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene.
The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization
problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we
demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many
sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest
saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an
off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle
is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our
prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with
48dB dynamic range.
