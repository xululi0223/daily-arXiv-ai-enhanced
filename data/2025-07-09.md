### [1] [TokenShapley: Token Level Context Attribution with Shapley Value](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05261)
*Yingtai Xiao,Yuqing Zhu,Sirat Samyoun,Wanrong Zhang,Jiachen T. Wang,Jian Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出TokenShapley方法，通过结合Shapley值和KNN检索技术，实现细粒度的token级数据归因，显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在句子级归因表现不足，无法满足用户对特定关键词（如数字、年份、名称）的归因需求。

Method: 结合Shapley值的数据归因和KNN检索技术，利用预计算的数据存储进行上下文检索，量化token重要性。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，TokenShapley在token级归因上优于现有方法，准确性提升11-23%。

Conclusion: TokenShapley为LLM生成内容的细粒度归因提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in in-context
learning, but verifying the correctness of their generated responses remains a
challenge. Prior work has explored attribution at the sentence level, but these
methods fall short when users seek attribution for specific keywords within the
response, such as numbers, years, or names. To address this limitation, we
propose TokenShapley, a novel token-level attribution method that combines
Shapley value-based data attribution with KNN-based retrieval techniques
inspired by recent advances in KNN-augmented LLMs. By leveraging a precomputed
datastore for contextual retrieval and computing Shapley values to quantify
token importance, TokenShapley provides a fine-grained data attribution
approach. Extensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that TokenShapley
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in token-level attribution, achieving an
11-23% improvement in accuracy.

### [2] [User Behavior Prediction as a Generic, Robust, Scalable, and Low-Cost Evaluation Strategy for Estimating Generalization in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05266)
*Sougata Saha,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出用用户行为预测替代知识检索和推理任务来评估大语言模型的泛化能力，并测试了三种模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据污染问题，传统任务难以衡量大语言模型的泛化能力，因此需要一种更可靠的方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于用户行为预测的新框架，并在电影和音乐推荐数据集上测试了GPT-4o、GPT-4o-mini和Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct。

Result: 结果显示GPT-4o表现优于其他模型，但所有模型仍有改进空间，尤其是Llama。

Conclusion: 用户行为预测是一种可行的替代方案，未来仍需进一步优化模型性能。

Abstract: Measuring the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
challenging due to data contamination. As models grow and computation becomes
cheaper, ensuring tasks and test cases are unseen during training phases will
become nearly impossible. We argue that knowledge-retrieval and reasoning tasks
are not ideal for measuring generalization, as LLMs are not trained for
specific tasks. Instead, we propose user behavior prediction, also a key aspect
of personalization, as a theoretically sound, scalable, and robust alternative.
We introduce a novel framework for this approach and test it on movie and music
recommendation datasets for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.
Results align with our framework's predictions, showing GPT-4o outperforms
GPT-4o-mini and Llama, though all models have much room for improvement,
especially Llama.

### [3] [An Adaptive Supervised Contrastive Learning Framework for Implicit Sexism Detection in Digital Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05271)
*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Aditya Shah,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASCEND框架通过自适应监督对比学习检测隐性性别歧视，结合阈值对比学习和多特征增强，显著提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上隐性性别歧视内容传播广泛，但传统检测方法难以捕捉其细微特征。

Method: 采用自适应监督对比学习框架（ASCEND），结合阈值对比学习、词级注意力模块及情感、情绪和毒性特征。

Result: 在EXIST2021和MLSC数据集上，ASCEND平均Macro F1提升9.86%、29.63%和32.51%。

Conclusion: ASCEND能有效捕捉隐性性别歧视的细微特征，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The global reach of social media has amplified the spread of hateful content,
including implicit sexism, which is often overlooked by conventional detection
methods. In this work, we introduce an Adaptive Supervised Contrastive lEarning
framework for implicit sexism detectioN (ASCEND). A key innovation of our
method is the incorporation of threshold-based contrastive learning: by
computing cosine similarities between embeddings, we selectively treat only
those sample pairs as positive if their similarity exceeds a learnable
threshold. This mechanism refines the embedding space by robustly pulling
together representations of semantically similar texts while pushing apart
dissimilar ones, thus reducing false positives and negatives. The final
classification is achieved by jointly optimizing a contrastive loss with a
cross-entropy loss. Textual features are enhanced through a word-level
attention module. Additionally, we employ sentiment, emotion, and toxicity
features. Evaluations on the EXIST2021 and MLSC datasets demonstrate that
ASCEND significantly outperforms existing methods, with average Macro F1
improvements of 9.86%, 29.63%, and 32.51% across multiple tasks, highlighting
its efficacy in capturing the subtle cues of implicit sexist language.

### [4] [Beyond classical and contemporary models: a transformative ai framework for student dropout prediction in distance learning using rag, prompt engineering, and cross-modal fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05285)
*Miloud Mihoubi,Meriem Zerkouk,Belkacem Chikhaoui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合RAG、提示工程和跨模态注意力融合的AI框架，用于预测学生辍学风险，准确率达89%，并生成可解释的干预措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程教育中的学生辍学问题对社会和经济有深远影响，传统机器学习模型难以捕捉非结构化交互中的情感和情境因素。

Method: 采用RAG增强的BERT模型进行情感分析，提示工程解码学术压力，跨模态注意力融合文本、行为和社会人口学数据。

Result: 在4,423名学生数据集上，准确率达89%，F1分数0.88，优于传统模型7%，减少假阴性21%。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了预测分析与可操作教学之间的鸿沟，为全球教育系统提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Student dropout in distance learning remains a critical challenge, with
profound societal and economic consequences. While classical machine learning
models leverage structured socio-demographic and behavioral data, they often
fail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors embedded in
unstructured student interactions. This paper introduces a transformative AI
framework that redefines dropout prediction through three synergistic
innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific sentiment
analysis, prompt engineering to decode academic stressors, and cross-modal
attention fusion to dynamically align textual, behavioral, and
socio-demographic insights. By grounding sentiment analysis in a curated
knowledge base of pedagogical content, our RAG-enhanced BERT model interprets
student comments with unprecedented contextual relevance, while optimized
prompts isolate indicators of academic distress (e.g., "isolation," "workload
anxiety"). A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with
temporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk profiles. Evaluated on a
longitudinal dataset of 4 423 students, the framework achieves 89% accuracy and
an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false
negatives by 21%. Beyond prediction, the system generates interpretable
interventions by retrieving contextually aligned strategies (e.g., mentorship
programs for isolated learners). This work bridges the gap between predictive
analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering a scalable solution to mitigate
dropout risks in global education systems

### [5] [LCDS: A Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary Generation System Supporting Source Attribution and Expert Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05319)
*Cheng Yuan,Xinkai Rui,Yongqi Fan,Yawei Fan,Boyang Zhong,Jiacheng Wang,Weiyan Zhang,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LCDS是一个逻辑控制的出院摘要生成系统，通过构建源映射表和逻辑规则，解决LLMs在生成出院摘要时的幻觉问题，并支持内容溯源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成出院摘要时存在幻觉问题，且难以将生成内容与电子病历（EMRs）关联。

Method: LCDS通过计算EMRs与出院摘要的文本相似性构建源映射表，并引入逻辑规则生成可靠的摘要。

Result: 系统能够生成更可靠的出院摘要，并支持内容溯源和专家反馈。

Conclusion: LCDS有效解决了LLMs的幻觉问题，并提供了可溯源的摘要生成方案。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
automated discharge summary generation, they still suffer from hallucination
issues, such as generating inaccurate content or fabricating information
without valid sources. In addition, electronic medical records (EMRs) typically
consist of long-form data, making it challenging for LLMs to attribute the
generated content to the sources. To address these challenges, we propose LCDS,
a Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary generation system. LCDS constructs a
source mapping table by calculating textual similarity between EMRs and
discharge summaries to constrain the scope of summarized content. Moreover,
LCDS incorporates a comprehensive set of logical rules, enabling it to generate
more reliable silver discharge summaries tailored to different clinical fields.
Furthermore, LCDS supports source attribution for generated content, allowing
experts to efficiently review, provide feedback, and rectify errors. The
resulting golden discharge summaries are subsequently recorded for incremental
fine-tuning of LLMs. Our project and demo video are in the GitHub repository
https://github.com/ycycyc02/LCDS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对特定任务和领域微调的语言模型专家库的增多，需要高效的选择和组合方法。

Method: 提出LoRA-Augmented Generation (LAG)，通过过滤、检索和应用专家，无需额外训练或数据访问。

Result: 在知识密集型任务中表现优于现有无数据方法，且与检索增强生成（RAG）兼容。

Abstract: The proliferation of fine-tuned language model experts for specific tasks and
domains signals the need for efficient selection and combination methods. We
propose LoRA-Augmented Generation (LAG) for leveraging large libraries of
knowledge and task-specific LoRA adapters. LAG requires no additional training

per-token and layer basis. We evaluate LAG on various knowledge-intensive
tasks, achieving superior performance over existing data-free methods. We
explore scenarios where additional data is available, demonstrating LAG's
compatibility with alternative solutions such as retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG).

### [8] [On the Bias of Next-Token Predictors Toward Systematically Inefficient Reasoning: A Shortest-Path Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05362)
*Riccardo Alberghi,Elizaveta Demyanenko,Luca Biggio,Luca Saglietti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在大型语言模型中，训练时使用低效但连贯的推理路径（而非最优路径）能提升泛化能力，这与模型的预测信心相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究推理路径效率与泛化能力的关系，特别是在动态规划任务中。

Method: 通过训练解码器变换器，比较最优动态规划路径与低效回溯路径的效果。

Result: 低效但连贯的路径训练模型泛化能力更强，与预测信心相关。

Conclusion: 连贯且逐步的推理路径更易优化，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing highlight two key factors for
improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs): (i) allocating more
test-time compute tends to help on harder problems but often introduces
redundancy in the reasoning trace, and (ii) compute is most effective when
reasoning is systematic and incremental, forming structured chains of thought
(CoTs) akin to human problem-solving. To study these factors in isolation, we
introduce a controlled setting based on shortest-path tasks in layered graphs.
We train decoder-only transformers on question-trace-answer triples using a
custom tokenizer, comparing models trained on optimal bottom-up dynamic
programming traces with those trained on longer, valid traces involving
backtracking. Surprisingly, with the same training-token budget, models trained
on inefficient traces generalize better to unseen graphs. This benefit is not
due to length alone-injecting arbitrary redundancy into reasoning traces fails
to help and can even hurt performance. Instead, we find that generalization
correlates with the model's confidence in next-token prediction, suggesting
that long, coherent, and locally incremental traces make the training signal
easier to optimize.

*Guanzhong Pan,Mei Tan,Hyunji Nam,Lucía Langlois,James Malamut,Liliana Deonizio,Dorottya Demszky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EduCoder是一个专为教育对话设计的标注工具，支持复杂教学特征的标注，解决现有工具在教育对话标注中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用文本标注工具难以应对教育对话的复杂性，如多样化的师生互动和教学特征标注。

Method: EduCoder提供协作定义复杂编码手册的功能，支持分类和开放式标注，并包含上下文材料和多标注者对比功能。

Result: EduCoder是一个开源工具，支持研究者高效标注教育对话，提升数据可靠性。

Conclusion: EduCoder填补了教育对话标注工具的空白，为研究者和教育专家提供了实用平台。

Abstract: We introduce EduCoder, a domain-specialized tool designed to support
utterance-level annotation of educational dialogue. While general-purpose text
annotation tools for NLP and qualitative research abound, few address the
complexities of coding education dialogue transcripts -- with diverse
teacher-student and peer interactions. Common challenges include defining
codebooks for complex pedagogical features, supporting both open-ended and
categorical coding, and contextualizing utterances with external features, such
as the lesson's purpose and the pedagogical value of the instruction. EduCoder
is designed to address these challenges by providing a platform for researchers
and domain experts to collaboratively define complex codebooks based on
observed data. It incorporates both categorical and open-ended annotation types
along with contextual materials. Additionally, it offers a side-by-side
comparison of multiple annotators' responses, allowing comparison and
calibration of annotations with others to improve data reliability. The system
is open-source, with a demo video available.

### [10] [The Generalization Ridge: Information Flow in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05387)
*Ruidi Chang,Chunyuan Deng,Hanjie Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出InfoRidge框架，通过信息论方法分析Transformer模型中任务相关信息在不同层间的流动，发现预测信息在中间层达到峰值（形成“泛化岭”），并揭示了中间层在泛化中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer模型在自然语言生成任务中表现优异，但其内部如何合成任务相关信息仍不清楚。研究旨在揭示模型训练过程中泛化能力如何在各层间形成和传播。

Method: 提出InfoRidge框架，通过估计隐藏表示与目标输出间的互信息，追踪任务相关信息在模型中的流动。引入残差缩放系数作为功能探针，评估各层重要性。

Result: 实验发现预测信息在中间层达到峰值（泛化岭），随后在最终层下降。在分布偏移下，模型更依赖中间层，表明其在泛化中的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer内部机制，强调了中间层在泛化中的关键作用，为模型设计和优化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in natural language generation (NLG) tasks, yet their internal mechanisms for
synthesizing task-relevant information remain insufficiently understood. While
prior studies suggest that intermediate layers often yield more generalizable
representations than final layers, how this generalization ability emerges and
propagates across layers during training remains unclear. To address this gap,
we propose InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to characterize how
predictive information-the mutual information between hidden representations
and target outputs-varies across depth. Estimating this quantity enables us to
trace the flow of task-relevant information throughout the model during
training. Our experiments across various models and datasets reveal a
consistent non-monotonic trend: predictive information peaks in upper-middle
layers-forming a generalization ridge-before declining in final layers,
reflecting a transition between generalization and memorization. To further
investigate this phenomenon, we introduce residual scaling
coefficients-trainable scalar parameters applied to each residual block-which
serve as functional probes for assessing the relative importance of individual
transformer layers. These coefficients reveal that, under distribution shift,
models downweight final layers and increasingly rely on ridge layers,
highlighting their role in generalization. Together, these findings offer new
insights into the internal mechanisms of transformers and underscore the
critical role of intermediate layers in supporting generalization.

### [11] [Controlling What You Share: Assessing Language Model Adherence to Privacy Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05391)
*Guillem Ramírez,Alexandra Birch,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过隐私配置文件（自然语言指令）保护用户数据隐私的方法，提出了一种本地模型框架，用于重写查询以隐藏敏感信息，同时引入了一个多语言数据集PEEP用于研究。实验表明轻量级LLM能部分遵循指令，但仍需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户在使用商业API时数据隐私暴露的问题，让用户通过自然语言指令控制数据共享。

Method: 构建本地模型框架，利用隐私配置文件重写查询，隐藏敏感信息后发送至外部模型；引入PEEP数据集支持研究。

Result: 轻量级LLM能部分遵循隐私指令，但存在一致性问题，需改进模型对用户隐私偏好的理解与遵从。

Conclusion: 隐私配置文件是一种有前景的方法，但需进一步优化模型以更好地满足用户隐私需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are primarily accessed via commercial APIs, but
this often requires users to expose their data to service providers. In this
paper, we explore how users can stay in control of their data by using privacy
profiles: simple natural language instructions that say what should and should
not be revealed. We build a framework where a local model uses these
instructions to rewrite queries, only hiding details deemed sensitive by the
user, before sending them to an external model, thus balancing privacy with
performance. To support this research, we introduce PEEP, a multilingual
dataset of real user queries annotated to mark private content and paired with
synthetic privacy profiles. Our experiments with lightweight LLMs show they can
follow these instructions to some extent, but also face consistent challenges,
highlighting the need for models that better understand and comply with
user-defined privacy preferences.

*Jaedong Hwang,Kumar Tanmay,Seok-Jin Lee,Ayush Agrawal,Hamid Palangi,Kumar Ayush,Ila Fiete,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了GeoFact-X基准和BRIDGE方法，以提升多语言大模型在低资源语言中的推理能力，并通过语言一致性奖励优化推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多语言任务中的推理能力不足，尤其是在低资源语言中容易产生偏差，影响准确性和可信度。

Method: 引入GeoFact-X基准，包含五种语言的标注推理轨迹；提出BRIDGE方法，结合监督微调和强化学习，通过语言一致性奖励优化推理。

Result: BRIDGE显著提升了多语言推理的准确性，证明了推理感知的强化学习对跨语言泛化的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多语言推理一致性的重要性，并为未来多语言模型优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like
mathematics, factual QA, and code generation, yet their multilingual reasoning
capabilities in these tasks remain underdeveloped. Especially for low-resource
languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or
default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource
languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. Current
multilingual benchmarks focus only on final answers, overlooking whether models
actually reason in the target language. To address this gap, we introduce
GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark with
annotated reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese,
Swahili, and Thai. We further propose BRIDGE, a novel training method that
guides supervised fine-tuning and test-time reinforcement learning with a
language-consistency reward to align reasoning with the input language.
Finally, we develop an automatic evaluation protocol using LLM-as-a-judge to
assess answer correctness and the quality and language consistency of reasoning
traces, enabling nuanced and scalable analysis beyond surface-level metrics.
Our results show that BRIDGE significantly enhances multilingual reasoning
fidelity, demonstrating that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement
learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization.

*Yufei Tao,Adam Hiatt,Rahul Seetharaman,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出CoPE框架，用于评估大语言模型如何整合上下文和参数知识，发现模型存在“lost-in-the-later”现象，即忽略后文信息。CoT提示会降低上下文利用效果，而CK-informed提示能改善事实依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型如何优先整合上下文和参数知识，填补研究空白。

Method: 引入CoPE评估框架和MultiWikiAtomic数据集，分析模型在开放问答中的表现。

Result: 发现模型存在位置偏见（lost-in-the-later），CoT提示降低上下文利用效果。

Conclusion: CK-informed提示能有效改善模型的事实依据和减少幻觉。

Abstract: Large language models are capable of leveraging both contextual and
parametric knowledge but how they prioritize and integrate these sources
remains underexplored. We introduce CoPE, a novel evaluation framework that
systematically measures contextual knowledge (CK) and parametric knowledge (PK)
across models and languages. Using our MultiWikiAtomic dataset in English,
Spanish, and Danish, we analyze how large language models (LLMs) integrate
context, prioritize information, and incorporate PK in open-ended question
answering. Our analysis uncovers a phenomenon we call lost-in-the-later, where
LLMs tend to overlook or deprioritize information that appears later in a given
context, revealing a strong positional bias that affects contextual grounding.
We further find that reasoning models, as well as non-reasoning models prompted
with chain-of-thought (CoT), use context even less than non-reasoning models
without CoT and fail to mitigate the lost-in-the-later effect. CoT prompting,
in particular, results in lower recall and shorter responses, leading to
degraded contextual grounding. Based on these insights, we design prompt-based
methods to effectively leverage input context. A case study applying CoPE to
summarization demonstrates that CK-informed prompting improves factual
grounding and reduces hallucination.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究分析了美国最高法院2022年Dobbs案裁决后，性别和地区政治背景如何影响公众对堕胎的讨论，发现性别在保守地区显著调节态度和情感表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨性别和地方政治背景如何交互影响公众对堕胎的讨论，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 基于近1000万条X（原Twitter）上带有性别、意识形态和地理位置信息的堕胎相关帖子进行分析。

Result: 性别显著调节堕胎态度和情感表达，尤其在保守地区；Dobbs案草案泄露后，支持堕胎的女性在受威胁地区更活跃。

Conclusion: 堕胎讨论不仅受意识形态极化影响，还深层次由性别和地区塑造，身份认同在制度动荡时对政治表达起核心作用。

Abstract: The U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
Organization marked a turning point in the national debate over reproductive
rights. While the ideological divide over abortion is well documented, less is
known about how gender and local sociopolitical contexts interact to shape
public discourse. Drawing on nearly 10 million abortion-related posts on X
(formerly Twitter) from users with inferred gender, ideology and location, we
show that gender significantly moderates abortion attitudes and emotional
expression, particularly in conservative regions, and independently of
ideology. This creates a gender gap in abortion attitudes that grows more
pronounced in conservative regions. The leak of the Dobbs draft opinion further
intensified online engagement, disproportionately mobilizing pro-abortion women
in areas where access was under threat. These findings reveal that abortion
discourse is not only ideologically polarized but also deeply structured by
gender and place, highlighting the central role of identity in shaping
political expression during moments of institutional disruption.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PhoniTale是一个基于LLM的跨语言助记系统，通过音素相似性生成L1关键词序列，帮助L2学习者记忆词汇。实验表明其效果接近人工助记，并指出了未来改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决L2学习者在学习远距离语言（如英语和韩语）时词汇记忆的困难，尤其是针对非英语母语者的需求。

Method: 开发PhoniTale系统，利用LLM基于音素相似性生成L1关键词序列，并通过自动指标和人工评估验证其效果。

Result: PhoniTale的表现与人工助记相当，短期记忆测试证实其有效性。

Conclusion: PhoniTale为L2词汇学习提供了有效工具，未来需进一步提升助记质量和研究方法。

Abstract: Vocabulary acquisition poses a significant challenge for second-language (L2)
learners, especially when learning typologically distant languages such as
English and Korean, where phonological and structural mismatches complicate
vocabulary learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
generate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's
first language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most of this
research has focused on native English speakers learning other languages,
rather than the reverse. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novel
cross-lingual mnemonic generation system that retrieves L1 keyword sequence
based on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics. We
evaluate PhoniTale using both automated metrics and human evaluations,
comparing its output to mnemonics created by humans and by previous automated
approaches. To assess practical effectiveness, we also conduct a short-term
recall test measuring mnemonic helpfulness. Our findings show that PhoniTale
performs comparably to human-authored mnemonics. We also highlight key areas
for future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.

Method: 通过分析LLMs的内部工作机制及其语言生成表示，并结合Frege和Russell的经典语义理论。

Result: 研究揭示了LLMs在语义能力上的潜在局限性及其与人类语言理解的差异。

Conclusion: LLMs在语义表现上具有潜力，但与人类语言理解仍有差距，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrated the potential to
replicate human language abilities through technology, ranging from text
generation to engaging in conversations. However, it remains controversial to
what extent these systems truly understand language. We examine this issue by
narrowing the question down to the semantics of LLMs at the word and sentence
level. By examining the inner workings of LLMs and their generated
representation of language and by drawing on classical semantic theories by
Frege and Russell, we get a more nuanced picture of the potential semantic
capabilities of LLMs.

Motivation: 现有毒性检测模型忽视多样化的标注者视角，导致对特定语境（如语言回收）的毒性识别不足。

Method: 构建包含6.8K社交媒体帖子和40K标注的MODELCITIZENS数据集，并利用LLM生成对话场景增强上下文。训练LLAMACITIZEN-8B和GEMMACITIZEN-12B模型。

Result: 现有工具在MODELCITIZENS上表现不佳，新模型比GPT-o4-mini提升5.5%。

Conclusion: 社区驱动的标注和建模对包容性内容审核至关重要。

Abstract: Automatic toxic language detection is critical for creating safe, inclusive
online spaces. However, it is a highly subjective task, with perceptions of
toxic language shaped by community norms and lived experience. Existing
toxicity detection models are typically trained on annotations that collapse
diverse annotator perspectives into a single ground truth, erasing important
context-specific notions of toxicity such as reclaimed language. To address
this, we introduce MODELCITIZENS, a dataset of 6.8K social media posts and 40K
toxicity annotations across diverse identity groups. To capture the role of
conversational context on toxicity, typical of social media posts, we augment
MODELCITIZENS posts with LLM-generated conversational scenarios.
State-of-the-art toxicity detection tools (e.g. OpenAI Moderation API,
GPT-o4-mini) underperform on MODELCITIZENS, with further degradation on
context-augmented posts. Finally, we release LLAMACITIZEN-8B and
GEMMACITIZEN-12B, LLaMA- and Gemma-based models finetuned on MODELCITIZENS,
which outperform GPT-o4-mini by 5.5% on in-distribution evaluations. Our
findings highlight the importance of community-informed annotation and modeling
for inclusive content moderation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and o1 have demonstrated strong
performance on clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks across multiple
medical benchmarks. Nonetheless, two high-impact NLP tasks - structured tabular
reporting from nurse dictations and medical order extraction from
doctor-patient consultations - remain underexplored due to data scarcity and
sensitivity, despite active industry efforts. Practical solutions to these
real-world clinical tasks can significantly reduce the documentation burden on
healthcare providers, allowing greater focus on patient care. In this paper, we
investigate these two challenging tasks using private and open-source clinical
datasets, evaluating the performance of both open- and closed-weight LLMs, and
analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we propose
an agentic pipeline for generating realistic, non-sensitive nurse dictations,
enabling structured extraction of clinical observations. To support further
research in both areas, we release SYNUR and SIMORD, the first open-source
datasets for nurse observation extraction and medical order extraction.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在推理时性能提升的问题，避免依赖高级模型的蒸馏数据获取链式思维训练数据。

Method: 采用双级检索增强上下文学习：粗粒度级别提取抽象模板，细粒度级别在蒙特卡洛树搜索中检索类似中间步骤，结合过程奖励模型优化推理。

Conclusion: R2-LLMs在复杂推理任务中表现出色，是一种高效的推理增强方法。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
leveraging additional computational resources at inference time to enhance
model performance. In this work, we introduce R2-LLMs, a novel and versatile
hierarchical retrieval-augmented reasoning framework designed to improve
test-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) without requiring
distillation from more advanced models to obtain chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data. R2-LLMs enhances inference-time generalization by integrating
dual-level retrieval-based in-context learning: (1) At the coarse level, our
approach extracts abstract templates from complex reasoning problems and
retrieves similar problem-answer pairs to facilitate high-level in-context
learning; (2) At the fine level, during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), R2-LLMs
efficiently retrieves analogous intermediate solution steps from reference
mathematical problem datasets, refining step-wise reasoning with the aid of a
process reward model (PRM) for scoring. R2-LLMs is a robust hierarchical
reasoning-augmentation method that enhances in-context-level reasoning while
seamlessly integrating with step-level tree search methods. Utilizing PRM, it
refines both candidate generation and decision-making for improved reasoning
accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the MATH500, GSM8K, and OlympiadBench-TO
datasets achieve substantial relative improvement with an increase of up to 16%
using LLaMA-3.1-8B compared to the baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of
our approach in complex reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂指令遵循和资源效率方面存在不足，Re5旨在解决这些问题。

Method: Re5通过提取任务和约束组件、结构评估和选择性修订来优化指令遵循。

Result: 实验显示Re5在少量数据下性能接近GPT-4o-mini，且64.24%的胜率优于未修订初始响应。

Conclusion: Re5是一种高效且资源节约的解决方案，可显著提升指令遵循能力。

Abstract: Various techniques have been proposed to improve large language models (LLMs)
adherence to formatting and instruction constraints. One of the most effective
approaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models.
However, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a
single generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have
been introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision
iterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a
resource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage
high-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation
capabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a
degradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed
to enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of
the generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user
instructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation,
and applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by
selective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving
improvements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning,
enabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative
refinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves
instruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data
generated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of
data while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the
non-revised initial responses. These results validate Re5 as an efficient and
effective solution for enhancing instruction adherence with minimal external
supervision.

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏中LLM向SLM传递知识，但在文本匹配等任务中，微调的小模型可能表现更好。本文旨在结合小模型的领域专长和LLM的语义理解能力。

Method: 通过LoRA将LLM重新解释为编码器-解码器结构，编码器生成压缩表示，解码器映射到输出空间。训练中使用MCL对齐SLM和LLM的相似性分数。

Result: 在金融和医疗领域的基准测试及实际应用中验证了方法的有效性，模型已在线部署。

Conclusion: 翻转知识蒸馏范式成功结合了LLM和SLM的优势，通过MCL优化相似性对齐，提升了性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation typically involves transferring knowledge from a Large
Language Model (LLM) to a Smaller Language Model (SLM). However, in tasks such
as text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective
domain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of
input pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the
rich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge
distillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the
architectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by
reinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder
generates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output
space. During training, the encoder produces representations and their
similarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the
teacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.
The MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and
adaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative
samples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing
the LLM to achieve improved performance. Experiments on financial and
healthcare benchmarks, as well as real-world applications, confirm its
effectiveness, and the model has been fully deployed in an online environment.

Motivation: 解决RAG中有效上下文长度受限和检索文档冗余的问题，同时避免压缩方法丢失关键细节。

Method: SARA结合自然语言片段和语义压缩向量，采用双层次上下文表示和动态重排模块。

Result: 在9个数据集和5个开源LLM上，SARA显著提升了答案相关性（+17.71）、正确性（+13.72）和语义相似性（+15.53）。

Conclusion: SARA证明了结合文本和压缩表示对高效上下文RAG的重要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but faces key challenges: restricted effective context
length and redundancy in retrieved documents. Pure compression-based approaches
reduce input size but often discard fine-grained details essential for factual
accuracy. We propose SARA, a unified RAG framework that balances local
precision and global knowledge coverage under tight context budgets. SARA
combines natural-language text snippets with semantic compression vectors to
jointly enhance context efficiency and answer correctness. It represents
contexts at two complementary levels: 1) fine-grained natural-language spans
that preserve critical entities and numerical values, and 2) compact,
interpretable vectors that summarize high-level semantics. An iterative
evidence-selection module employs the compression vectors for dynamic reranking
of contexts. Across 9 datasets and 5 open-source LLMs spanning 3 model families
(Mistral, Llama, and Gemma), SARA consistently improves answer relevance
(+17.71), answer correctness (+13.72), and semantic similarity (+15.53),
demonstrating the importance of integrating textual and compressed
representations for robust, context-efficient RAG.

Russian, remain scarce and static, failing to capture the dynamic nature of
real-world deployments.
  In this work, we present DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), the first
dynamic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in Russian on a changing news
corpora. DRAGON is built upon a regularly updated corpus of Russian news and
public documents and supports comprehensive evaluation of both the retriever
and generator components. Question generation is performed automatically with
the use of Knowledge Graph constructed from the corpus and enables the
extraction of four core question types aligned with distinct subgraph patterns.
We release a complete evaluation framework comprising the pipeline for
automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, which are potentially
reusable for other languages and multilingual settings, and benchmark data. We

Method: 提出HIRAG方法，包含三个渐进层次能力：信息筛选、语义信息跨段落组合、RAG特定推理，并采用“先思考后回答”策略。

Result: 实验表明，HIRAG在RGB、PopQA、MuSiQue、HotpotQA和PubmedQA等数据集上显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: HIRAG通过分层思维指令微调有效解决了传统RAG系统的局限性，提升了模型处理外部知识的能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a fundamental paradigm for
addressing the challenges faced by large language models in handling real-time
information and domain-specific problems. Traditional RAG systems primarily
rely on the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of the large language model
itself. Still, in-depth research on the specific capabilities needed by the RAG
generation model is lacking, leading to challenges with inconsistent document
quality and retrieval system imperfections. Even the limited studies that
fine-tune RAG generative models often \textit{lack a granular focus on RAG
task} or \textit{a deeper utilization of chain-of-thought processes}. To
address this, we propose that RAG models should possess three progressively
hierarchical abilities (1) Filtering: the ability to select relevant
information; (2) Combination: the ability to combine semantic information
across paragraphs; and (3) RAG-specific reasoning: the ability to further
process external knowledge using internal knowledge. Thus, we introduce our new
RAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a "think before answering"
strategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by
utilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought. Experiments show that the
HIRAG training strategy significantly improves the model's performance on
datasets such as RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE方法中，各层的路由器独立选择专家，缺乏层间协作，限制了专家的专业化。

Method: 采用共享路由器策略，增强不同MoE层专家的协作与专业化。

Result: 在10个多样化ASR基准测试中，Omni-router Transformer平均词错误率分别比密集模型和Switch Transformer降低11.2%和8.2%。

Conclusion: 共享路由器策略有效提升了专家协作和模型性能，同时增强了数据多样性下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling
to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the
Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis
reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly
correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the
cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater
specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call
this model \emph{Omni-router Transformer}. Extensive experiments on a
large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse,
out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is
able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and
Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%,
respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness
to diverse data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in multi-turn
conversational tasks, yet their pre-training data predominantly consists of
continuous prose, creating a potential mismatch between required capabilities

discrepancy by synthesizing conversational data from existing text corpora. We
present a pipeline that transforms a cluster of multiple related documents into
an extended multi-turn, multi-topic information-seeking dialogue. Applying our
pipeline to Wikipedia articles, we curate DocTalk, a multi-turn pre-training
dialogue corpus consisting of over 730k long conversations. We hypothesize that
exposure to such synthesized conversational structures during pre-training can
enhance the fundamental multi-turn capabilities of LLMs, such as context memory
and understanding. Empirically, we show that incorporating DocTalk during
pre-training results in up to 40% gain in context memory and understanding,
without compromising base performance. DocTalk is available at

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在涉及模态补全文本任务中的推理能力，发现某些模型在特定对象类别上表现不佳，尤其是在日语提示下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LVLMs在模态补全文本任务中的表现，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 基于基本形式本体论构建基准，系统分类模态补全任务，评估多种LVLMs的表现。

Result: 部分LVLMs在特定对象类别上表现较差，日语提示下尤其明显。

Conclusion: LVLMs在模态补全任务中表现参差不齐，日语能力存在缺陷。

Abstract: One of the main objectives in developing large vision-language models (LVLMs)
is to engineer systems that can assist humans with multimodal tasks, including
interpreting descriptions of perceptual experiences. A central phenomenon in
this context is amodal completion, in which people perceive objects even when
parts of those objects are hidden. Although numerous studies have assessed
whether computer-vision algorithms can detect or reconstruct occluded regions,
the inferential abilities of LVLMs on texts related to amodal completion remain
unexplored. To address this gap, we constructed a benchmark grounded in Basic
Formal Ontology to achieve a systematic classification of amodal completion.
Our results indicate that while many LVLMs achieve human-comparable performance
overall, their accuracy diverges for certain types of objects being completed.
Notably, in certain categories, some LLaVA-NeXT variants and Claude 3.5 Sonnet
exhibit lower accuracy on original images compared to blank stimuli lacking
visual content. Intriguingly, this disparity emerges only under Japanese
prompting, suggesting a deficiency in Japanese-specific linguistic competence
among these models.

TL;DR: 研究比较了不同性能与偏见度量方法，评估荷兰语端到端ASR系统，发现平均错误率不足，需补充其他度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统对不同说话者群体存在偏见，现有研究多关注检测与量化偏见，但如何衡量系统性能与偏见仍是开放问题。

Method: 比较文献与提出的性能及偏见度量方法，评估荷兰语端到端ASR系统，并应用多种偏见缓解策略。

Result: 平均错误率不足以全面衡量系统性能与偏见，需补充其他度量方法。

Conclusion: 建议报告ASR性能与偏见时采用更全面的度量方法，以更好反映系统对不同说话者群体的表现与整体偏见。

Abstract: There is increasingly more evidence that automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems are biased against different speakers and speaker groups, e.g., due to
gender, age, or accent. Research on bias in ASR has so far primarily focused on
detecting and quantifying bias, and developing mitigation approaches. Despite
this progress, the open question is how to measure the performance and bias of
a system. In this study, we compare different performance and bias measures,
from literature and proposed, to evaluate state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR
systems for Dutch. Our experiments use several bias mitigation strategies to
address bias against different speaker groups. The findings reveal that
averaged error rates, a standard in ASR research, alone is not sufficient and
should be supplemented by other measures. The paper ends with recommendations
for reporting ASR performance and bias to better represent a system's
performance for diverse speaker groups, and overall system bias.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的虚拟受访者模拟框架，用于高效生成具有构念效度的心理测量调查项。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要昂贵的大规模人类数据收集，而LLM的普及使得需要一种更高效的调查项生成方法。

Method: 通过模拟具有多样化中介因素的虚拟受访者，识别能够稳健测量目标特质的调查项。

Result: 在三种心理特质理论（Big5、Schwartz、VIA）上的实验表明，该方法能有效识别高效度的调查项。

Conclusion: 该框架为低成本调查开发开辟了新方向，并有助于理解LLM如何模拟人类行为。

Abstract: As psychometric surveys are increasingly used to assess the traits of large
language models (LLMs), the need for scalable survey item generation suited for
LLMs has also grown. A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct
validity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended
trait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection.
To make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation
using LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which
the same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By
simulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that
robustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait
theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and
simulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate
the ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to
simulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation,
metrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective
survey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like
behavior. We will publicly release our dataset and code to support future work.

Motivation: 研究知识编辑评估方法的稳健性及其对模型整体能力的影响，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过选择不同指标、评估方法和编辑批量大小，分析其对知识编辑器排名的影响，并手动评估字符串匹配方法的准确性。

Result: 不同指标和方法会导致编辑器排名变化，字符串匹配方法容易产生假阳性匹配。

Conclusion: 知识编辑评估方法需要更稳健的设计，以避免偏差和对模型能力的负面影响。

Abstract: Model editing has been gaining increasing attention over the past few years.
For Knowledge Editing in particular, more challenging evaluation datasets have
recently been released. These datasets use different methodologies to score the
success of editors. Yet, it remains under-explored how robust these
methodologies are and whether they unfairly favor some editors. Moreover, the
disruptive impact of these editors on overall model capabilities remains a
constant blind spot.
  We address both of these problems and show that choosing different metrics
and evaluation methodologies as well as different edit batch sizes can lead to
a different ranking of knowledge editors. Crucially we demonstrate this effect
also on general language understanding tasks evaluated alongside the knowledge
editing tasks. Further we include a manual assessment of the string matching
based evaluation method for knowledge editing that is favored by recently
released datasets, revealing a tendency to produce false positive matches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DAEDCMD的新方法，用于解决持续多模态虚假信息检测（MMD）中的知识遗忘和未来数据泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上多模态虚假信息的广泛传播带来了严重的负面影响，而现有的MMD方法因依赖离线数据而无法适应新事件的持续出现。

Method: 通过基于Dirichlet过程的混合专家结构隔离事件特定参数的干扰以记忆过去知识，并通过学习连续时间动态模型预测未来环境分布。

Result: 实验表明，DAEDCMD在性能上显著优于六种MMD基线和三种持续学习方法。

Conclusion: DAEDCMD能有效解决持续MMD中的知识遗忘和未来泛化问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Nowadays, misinformation articles, especially multimodal ones, are widely
spread on social media platforms and cause serious negative effects. To control
their propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active
topic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD
methods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in
real-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models
trained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this
issue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,
inducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by
two major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the
detection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second,
the social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the
generalization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to
remember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific
parameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and
anticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time
dynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and
significantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and
three continual learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ghosting在聊天系统中越来越重要，但缺乏标准化基准和性能分析，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用四种公开对话数据集，实验了多种自动补全方法（如tries、n-gram和深度学习），并提出了一种基于熵的动态停止策略。

Result: n-gram和tries在已知前缀上表现优于深度学习模型，而神经模型（如T5和Phi-2）在未知查询上表现更好。对话上下文显著提升了补全质量。

Conclusion: 研究为Ghosting提供了基准和分析，并公开了代码和数据，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ghosting, the ability to predict a user's intended text input for inline
query auto-completion, is an invaluable feature for modern search engines and
chat interfaces, greatly enhancing user experience. By suggesting completions
to incomplete queries (or prefixes), ghosting aids users with slow typing
speeds, disabilities, or limited language proficiency. Ghosting is a
challenging problem and has become more important with the ubiquitousness of
chat-based systems like ChatGPT, Copilot, etc. Despite the increasing
prominence of chat-based systems utilizing ghosting, this challenging problem
of Chat-Ghosting has received little attention from the NLP/ML research
community. There is a lack of standardized benchmarks and relative performance
analysis of deep learning and non-deep learning methods. We address this
through an open and thorough study of this problem using four publicly
available dialog datasets: two human-human (DailyDialog and DSTC7-Ubuntu) and
two human-bot (Open Assistant and ShareGPT). We experiment with various
existing query auto-completion methods (using tries), n-gram methods and deep
learning methods, with and without dialog context. We also propose a novel
entropy-based dynamic early stopping strategy. Our analysis finds that
statistical n-gram models and tries outperform deep learning based models in
terms of both model performance and inference efficiency for seen prefixes. For
unseen queries, neural models like T5 and Phi-2 lead to better results. Adding
conversational context leads to significant improvements in ghosting quality,
especially for Open-Assistant and ShareGPT. We make code and data publicly
available

TL;DR: OpenFActScore是一个开源实现，用于评估大语言模型生成文本的事实性，支持开放模型，性能接近闭源系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提供透明、可复现且成本效益高的事实性评估工具，替代依赖闭源商业模型的FActScore。

Method: 使用Atomic Fact Generation (AFG)提取事实声明，Atomic Fact Validation (AFV)验证声明，支持Hugging Face兼容模型。

Result: 开源模型性能接近闭源系统，Gemma表现最佳，Pearson相关性达0.99。

Conclusion: OpenFActScore推动了透明度和可复现性，为事实性评估提供了高效开源解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce OpenFActScore, an open-source implementation of the FActScore
framework for evaluating the factuality of text generated by large language
models (LLMs). FActScore evaluates the factual accuracy of long-form text by
using Atomic Fact Generation (AFG) to extract individual factual claims and
Atomic Fact Validation (AFV) to verify each claim against a trusted knowledge
source. While the original FActScore relies on closed-source and commercial
models such as InstructGPT and ChatGPT, OpenFActScore enables the use of any
Hugging Face-compatible model for both AFG and AFV. We provide a detailed
technical overview of our implementation, highlighting design choices and
modifications made to support open models. We evaluate multiple open-source
LLMs on both AFG and AFV using the original FActScore benchmark, reporting
BERTScore-F1 for AFG and Error Rate relative to human annotations for AFV. Our
results show that open models can approximate the performance of closed-source
systems, with Gemma achieving the best overall performance, and our final setup
obtains a 0.99 Pearson correlation with the original FActScore experiments.
OpenFActScore promotes transparency, reproducibility, and cost-effective
evaluation, and is available at: https://github.com/lflage/OpenFActScore.

Result: 构建了包含5,000多个安全标注示例的数据集，评估显示现有分类器性能显著下降。

Conclusion: RabakBench为东南亚多语言环境提供了稳健的安全评估工具，并提供了构建本地化安全数据集的框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their safety classifiers often perform
poorly on low-resource languages due to limited training data and evaluation
benchmarks. This paper introduces RabakBench, a new multilingual safety
benchmark localized to Singapore's unique linguistic context, covering
Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. RabakBench is constructed through a
scalable three-stage pipeline: (i) Generate - adversarial example generation by
augmenting real Singlish web content with LLM-driven red teaming; (ii) Label -
semi-automated multi-label safety annotation using majority-voted LLM labelers
aligned with human judgments; and (iii) Translate - high-fidelity translation
preserving linguistic nuance and toxicity across languages. The final dataset
comprises over 5,000 safety-labeled examples across four languages and six
fine-grained safety categories with severity levels. Evaluations of 11 popular
open-source and closed-source guardrail classifiers reveal significant
performance degradation. RabakBench not only enables robust safety evaluation
in Southeast Asian multilingual settings but also offers a reproducible
framework for building localized safety datasets in low-resource environments.
The benchmark dataset, including the human-verified translations, and
evaluation code are publicly available.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升模型性能，并大幅减少碳排放。

Conclusion: 自进化方法有效解决了传统方法的挑战，同时优化了性能和可持续性。

Abstract: A common training approach for language models involves using a large-scale
language model to expand a human-provided dataset, which is subsequently used
for model training.This method significantly reduces training costs by
eliminating the need for extensive human data annotation. However, it still
faces challenges such as high carbon emissions during data augmentation and the
risk of data leakage when we use closed-source LLMs. To address these issues,
we propose a self-evolution method for language models. First, we introduce the
Multi-level Principle Generation, which enables a large-scale model to
summarize task-completion principles based on a small amount of task data.
Then, we propose the Principle-based Instance Generation, in which a
smaller-scale language model uses these task principles to generate a large
amount of data. This data is then used for model training. Experimental results
show that our proposed method significantly improves model performance compared
to directly using a smaller-scale language model to generate data.
Additionally, since we only use the large-scale language model to generate the
task-completion principles, the carbon emissions associated with training the
model are greatly reduced.

Motivation: 解决文档级实体和关系提取中高质量标注数据稀缺的问题，特别是在零样本或少样本场景下。

Method: 结合合成数据生成与基于检索的上下文学习，使用推理优化的语言模型，动态检索相关示例。

Result: 生成了包含5k+维基百科摘要、59k实体和30k关系三元组的合成数据集，并在DocIE共享任务中评估了零样本性能。

Conclusion: 文档级实体和关系提取对最先进的大语言模型仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Large, high-quality annotated corpora remain scarce in document-level entity
and relation extraction in zero-shot or few-shot settings. In this paper, we
present a fully automatic, LLM-based pipeline for synthetic data generation and
in-context learning for document-level entity and relation extraction. In
contrast to existing approaches that rely on manually annotated demonstrations
or direct zero-shot inference, our method combines synthetic data generation
with retrieval-based in-context learning, using a reasoning-optimized language
model. This allows us to build a high-quality demonstration database without
manual annotation and to dynamically retrieve relevant examples at inference
time. Based on our approach we produce a synthetic dataset of over $5k$
Wikipedia abstracts with approximately $59k$ entities and $30k$ relation
triples. Finally, we evaluate in-context learning performance on the DocIE
shared task, extracting entities and relations from long documents in a
zero-shot setting. We find that in-context joint entity and relation extraction
at document-level remains a challenging task, even for state-of-the-art large
language models.

this work, we introduce a conditional multistage failure recovery framework

error-handling stages, with three operating during task execution and one
functioning as a post-execution reflection phase. Our approach utilises the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to analyse execution challenges within their

performance, outperforming a baseline without error recovery by 11.5% and
surpassing the strongest existing model by 19%.

Conclusion: 熵是表征记忆难度的有效指标，随机字符串的低熵现象为数据推断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize portions of their training
data, sometimes reproducing content verbatim when prompted appropriately. In
this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the
domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training
data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models,
we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is
linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of
memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such
sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low
empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same
strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective
approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference
(DI).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到图像生成系统以英语为中心的问题，减少语义漂移、计算开销和文化偏差。

Result: 在m-GenEval和m-DPG上表现优异，同时保持强大的英语能力，模型更小且性能优越。

Conclusion: 多语言能力不是妥协，而是提升生成AI鲁棒性、效率和文化保真度的催化剂。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation advancements have been predominantly
English-centric, creating barriers for non-English speakers and perpetuating
digital inequities. While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these
introduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We
introduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a
new Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six
languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is
trained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and
high-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two
English-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG.
NeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining
strong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG.
Notably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while
outperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though
these models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the
effectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending
crosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously
assess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably,
NeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We
release an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated
dataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual
evaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates
that multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved
robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在代码生成中的真实能力，填补其与人类程序员之间的认知差距。

Method: 引入Code Triangle框架，从编辑分析、代码实现和测试用例生成三个维度系统评估LLM，并结合人类生成内容和模型混合进行改进。

Result: LLM能形成自洽系统，但解决方案缺乏多样性和鲁棒性；结合人类内容可显著提升性能。

Conclusion: LLM的认知一致性或不一致性为开发更强编码模型提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code
generation, yet their true programming competence remains underexplored. We
introduce the Code Triangle framework, which systematically evaluates LLMs
across three fundamental dimensions: editorial analysis, code implementation,
and test case generation. Through extensive experiments on competitive
programming benchmarks, we reveal that while LLMs can form a self-consistent
system across these dimensions, their solutions often lack the diversity and
robustness of human programmers. We identify a significant distribution shift
between model cognition and human expertise, with model errors tending to
cluster due to training data biases and limited reasoning transfer. Our study
demonstrates that incorporating human-generated editorials, solutions, and
diverse test cases, as well as leveraging model mixtures, can substantially
enhance both the performance and robustness of LLMs. Furthermore, we reveal
both the consistency and inconsistency in the cognition of LLMs that may
facilitate self-reflection and self-improvement, providing a potential
direction for developing more powerful coding models.

TL;DR: Skywork-R1V3是一种先进的视觉语言模型，通过强化学习框架提升推理能力，无需额外预训练，在MMMU上达到76.0%的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何将文本大语言模型的推理能力迁移到视觉任务中，并研究跨模态对齐的关键因素。

Method: 采用精心设计的强化学习后训练框架，激活模型推理能力，并引入关键推理标记熵作为检查点选择指标。

Result: Skywork-R1V3在MMMU上性能从64.3%提升至76.0%，匹配人类入门水平，38B参数模型媲美闭源VLM。

Conclusion: 强化学习是提升开源视觉语言模型能力的强大工具，Skywork-R1V3在多模态推理领域取得显著突破。

Abstract: We introduce Skywork-R1V3, an advanced, open-source vision-language model
(VLM) that pioneers a new approach to visual reasoning. Its key innovation lies
in effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language
Models (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily
stems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively
activates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for
additional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover
the fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal
alignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique
indicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens,
which has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training.
Skywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving
from 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities.
Remarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B
parameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation
successfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related
reasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and
reinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on
multimodal reasoning. Skywork-R1V3 represents a significant leap in multimodal
reasoning, showcasing RL as a powerful engine for advancing open-source VLM
capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出CriticLean框架，通过强化学习提升批评环节在数学形式化中的作用，并展示了CriticLeanGPT和CriticLeanBench的性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言数学语句形式化过程中批评环节的不足，确保生成的形式化代码准确反映原问题的语义意图。

Method: 提出CriticLeanGPT（监督微调与强化学习结合）和CriticLeanBench基准，构建FineLeanCorpus数据集。

Result: CriticLeanGPT显著优于基线模型，FineLeanCorpus包含28.5万问题，覆盖广且正确性高。

Conclusion: 优化批评环节对可靠形式化至关重要，CriticLean为形式化数学推理提供新思路。

Abstract: Translating natural language mathematical statements into formal, executable
code is a fundamental challenge in automated theorem proving. While prior work
has focused on generation and compilation success, little attention has been
paid to the critic phase-the evaluation of whether generated formalizations
truly capture the semantic intent of the original problem. In this paper, we
introduce CriticLean, a novel critic-guided reinforcement learning framework
that elevates the role of the critic from a passive validator to an active
learning component. Specifically, first, we propose the CriticLeanGPT, trained
via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to rigorously assess the
semantic fidelity of Lean 4 formalizations. Then, we introduce CriticLeanBench,
a benchmark designed to measure models' ability to distinguish semantically
correct from incorrect formalizations, and demonstrate that our trained
CriticLeanGPT models can significantly outperform strong open- and
closed-source baselines. Building on the CriticLean framework, we construct
FineLeanCorpus, a dataset comprising over 285K problems that exhibits rich
domain diversity, broad difficulty coverage, and high correctness based on
human evaluation. Overall, our findings highlight that optimizing the critic
phase is essential for producing reliable formalizations, and we hope our
CriticLean will provide valuable insights for future advances in formal
mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents our submission to Task 1, Subjectivity Detection, of the
CheckThat! Lab at CLEF 2025. We investigate the effectiveness of
transfer-learning and stylistic data augmentation to improve classification of
subjective and objective sentences in English news text. Our approach contrasts
fine-tuning of pre-trained encoders and transfer-learning of fine-tuned
transformer on related tasks. We also introduce a controlled augmentation
pipeline using GPT-4o to generate paraphrases in predefined subjectivity
styles. To ensure label and style consistency, we employ the same model to
correct and refine the generated samples. Results show that transfer-learning
of specified encoders outperforms fine-tuning general-purpose ones, and that
carefully curated augmentation significantly enhances model robustness,
especially in detecting subjective content. Our official submission placed us
$16^{th}$ of 24 participants. Overall, our findings underscore the value of
combining encoder specialization with label-consistent augmentation for
improved subjectivity detection. Our code is available at

Motivation: 数值声明在自动事实核查中具有独特挑战，需探索建模策略以提升准确性。

Method: 使用QuanTemp数据集和自建证据检索管道，评估ModernBERT的长上下文窗口、右到左标记化及其组合对分类性能的影响。

Result: 右到左标记化和长上下文窗口未显著提升性能，证据质量是主要瓶颈。最佳系统F1得分为0.57，排名前四。

Conclusion: 证据质量是数值声明事实核查的关键限制因素，未来研究应聚焦于此。

Abstract: Numerical claims, statements involving quantities, comparisons, and temporal
references, pose unique challenges for automated fact-checking systems. In this
study, we evaluate modeling strategies for veracity prediction of such claims
using the QuanTemp dataset and building our own evidence retrieval pipeline. We
investigate three key factors: (1) the impact of more evidences with longer
input context windows using ModernBERT, (2) the effect of right-to-left (R2L)
tokenization, and (3) their combined influence on classification performance.
Contrary to prior findings in arithmetic reasoning tasks, R2L tokenization does
not boost natural language inference (NLI) of numerical tasks. A longer context
window does also not enhance veracity performance either, highlighting evidence
quality as the dominant bottleneck. Our best-performing system achieves
competitive macro-average F1 score of 0.57 and places us among the Top-4
submissions in Task 3 of CheckThat! 2025. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文综述了潜在推理（latent reasoning）这一新兴领域，探讨了其在大型语言模型（LLMs）中的应用，旨在解决显式思维链（CoT）推理的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式思维链推理虽然提高了模型的可解释性和准确性，但其依赖自然语言限制了模型的表达能力。潜在推理通过完全在模型的连续隐藏状态中进行多步推理，解决了这一瓶颈。

Method: 论文首先探讨了神经网络层作为推理计算基础的作用，随后分析了多种潜在推理方法，包括基于激活的递归、隐藏状态传播以及微调策略，最后讨论了无限深度潜在推理等先进范式。

Result: 通过统一这些视角，论文澄清了潜在推理的概念框架，并为其未来研究方向提供了指导。

Conclusion: 潜在推理为LLM认知前沿研究提供了新的方向，有望进一步提升模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps. While CoT improves both
interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning
limits the model's expressive bandwidth. Latent reasoning tackles this
bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's
continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent
reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
emerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role
of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning,
highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations.
Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including
activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning
strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we
discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked
diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning
processes. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual
landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the
frontier of LLM cognition. An associated GitHub repository collecting the

TL;DR: 论文提出E²R-FLOPs指标，用于评估基于大语言模型（LLM）的重新排序任务的效率与效果权衡，解决了现有代理指标的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM重新排序任务效率的代理指标（如延迟、前向传递次数等）受硬件和运行时选择影响，难以准确衡量效率与效果的权衡。

Method: 提出E²R-FLOPs指标（RPP和QPP），并构建可解释的FLOPs估计器，无需实验即可估算FLOPs。

Result: 通过广泛实验评估不同架构的LLM重新排序器，研究了效率与效果的权衡。

Conclusion: E²R-FLOPs为研究社区提供了更准确的评估工具，推动了LLM重新排序任务的效率优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in
information retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high
computational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies
evaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as
latency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens.
However, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\eg
parallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size,
making it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the
efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose
E\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per
PetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for
hardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable
FLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even
without running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct
comprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with
different architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and
bringing this issue to the attention of the research community.

Motivation: 语言代理在复杂任务中难以有效修正错误和跨领域复用经验。

Method: 采用Reason-Retrieve-Refine管道，构建共享知识库，支持跨代理知识转移。

Result: 在GAIA基准上，成功率提升16.28个百分点；Claude-3和GPT-4在挑战性任务中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: Agent KB为代理提供了模块化、框架无关的基础设施，支持从历史经验中学习并推广成功策略。

Abstract: As language agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, they struggle with
effective error correction and experience reuse across domains. We introduce
Agent KB, a hierarchical experience framework that enables complex agentic
problem solving via a novel Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline. Agent KB addresses
a core limitation: agents traditionally cannot learn from each other's
experiences. By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution
logs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent
knowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success
rates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3
improves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on
intermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to
improve from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a
modular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from
past experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过结构化标注改进文本到图像生成模型的提示对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模数据集（如LAION-5B）的噪声和非结构化特性导致生成模型在提示对齐上表现不佳，用户需依赖复杂的提示工程。

Method: 提出Re-LAION-Caption 19M数据集，包含19M高质量图像及其结构化标注（主题、场景、美学、相机细节），并基于此微调PixArt-Σ和Stable Diffusion 2。

Result: 结构化标注显著提升了文本-图像对齐分数（通过VQA模型评估）。

Conclusion: 结构化标注是提升生成模型可控性和对齐能力的有效方法。

Abstract: We argue that generative text-to-image models often struggle with prompt
adherence due to the noisy and unstructured nature of large-scale datasets like
LAION-5B. This forces users to rely heavily on prompt engineering to elicit
desirable outputs. In this work, we propose that enforcing a consistent caption
structure during training can significantly improve model controllability and
alignment. We introduce Re-LAION-Caption 19M, a high-quality subset of
Re-LAION-5B, comprising 19 million 1024x1024 images with captions generated by
a Mistral 7B Instruct-based LLaVA-Next model. Each caption follows a four-part
template: subject, setting, aesthetics, and camera details. We fine-tune
PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Stable Diffusion 2 using both structured and randomly
shuffled captions, and show that structured versions consistently yield higher
text-image alignment scores using visual question answering (VQA) models. The
dataset is publicly available at

Motivation: 随着图像生成技术的快速发展，人脸深度伪造对安全领域构成重大挑战，亟需有效的检测方法。现有方法在伪造细节解释和幻觉问题上存在不足。

Method: 设计了CorrDetail框架，通过错误引导的问题校正真实伪造细节，并引入视觉细粒度细节增强模块以提高检测可靠性。采用融合决策策略增强模型对极端样本的判别能力。

Result: 实验表明，CorrDetail在性能上优于最新方法，能准确识别伪造细节，并具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CorrDetail为解决深度伪造检测中的解释性和幻觉问题提供了有效方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the swift progression of image generation technology, the widespread
emergence of facial deepfakes poses significant challenges to the field of
security, thus amplifying the urgent need for effective deepfake
detection.Existing techniques for face forgery detection can broadly be
categorized into two primary groups: visual-based methods and multimodal
approaches. The former often lacks clear explanations for forgery details,
while the latter, which merges visual and linguistic modalities, is more prone
to the issue of hallucinations.To address these shortcomings, we introduce a
visual detail enhanced self-correction framework, designated CorrDetail, for
interpretable face forgery detection. CorrDetail is meticulously designed to
rectify authentic forgery details when provided with error-guided questioning,
with the aim of fostering the ability to uncover forgery details rather than
yielding hallucinated responses. Additionally, to bolster the reliability of
its findings, a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module is incorporated,
supplying CorrDetail with more precise visual forgery details. Ultimately, a
fusion decision strategy is devised to further augment the model's
discriminative capacity in handling extreme samples, through the integration of
visual information compensation and model bias reduction.Experimental results
demonstrate that CorrDetail not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the latest methodologies but also excels in accurately identifying
forged details, all while exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception systems require robust pedestrian detection,
particularly on geometrically complex roadways like Type-S curved surfaces,
where standard RGB camera-based methods face limitations. This paper introduces
YOLO-APD, a novel deep learning architecture enhancing the YOLOv8 framework
specifically for this challenge. YOLO-APD integrates several key architectural
modifications: a parameter-free SimAM attention mechanism, computationally
efficient C3Ghost modules, a novel SimSPPF module for enhanced multi-scale
feature pooling, the Mish activation function for improved optimization, and an
Intelligent Gather & Distribute (IGD) module for superior feature fusion in the
network's neck. The concept of leveraging vehicle steering dynamics for
adaptive region-of-interest processing is also presented. Comprehensive
evaluations on a custom CARLA dataset simulating complex scenarios demonstrate
that YOLO-APD achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy, reaching 77.7%
mAP@0.5:0.95 and exceptional pedestrian recall exceeding 96%, significantly
outperforming baseline models, including YOLOv8. Furthermore, it maintains
real-time processing capabilities at 100 FPS, showcasing a superior balance
between accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies validate the synergistic
contribution of each integrated component. Evaluation on the KITTI dataset
confirms the architecture's potential while highlighting the need for domain
adaptation. This research advances the development of highly accurate,
efficient, and adaptable perception systems based on cost-effective sensors,
contributing to enhanced safety and reliability for autonomous navigation in
challenging, less-structured driving environments.

TL;DR: Spotlight是一种新的虚拟染色方法，通过引导模型关注细胞结构，改进了现有方法的背景噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟染色方法在训练时对所有像素平等处理，导致背景噪声和伪影被复制，而非关注生物信号。

Method: Spotlight使用基于直方图的前景估计来掩蔽像素级损失，并通过软阈值预测计算Dice损失以实现形状感知学习。

Result: 在3D基准数据集上，Spotlight改善了形态表示，同时保持了像素级精度，更适合下游任务。

Conclusion: Spotlight提供了一种更有效的虚拟染色方法，适用于分割和分析等任务。

Abstract: Microscopy enables direct observation of cellular morphology in 3D, with
transmitted-light methods offering low-cost, minimally invasive imaging and
fluorescence microscopy providing specificity and contrast. Virtual staining
combines these strengths by using machine learning to predict fluorescence
images from label-free inputs. However, training of existing methods typically
relies on loss functions that treat all pixels equally, thus reproducing
background noise and artifacts instead of focusing on biologically meaningful
signals. We introduce Spotlight, a simple yet powerful virtual staining
approach that guides the model to focus on relevant cellular structures.
Spotlight uses histogram-based foreground estimation to mask pixel-wise loss
and to calculate a Dice loss on soft-thresholded predictions for shape-aware
learning. Applied to a 3D benchmark dataset, Spotlight improves morphological
representation while preserving pixel-level accuracy, resulting in virtual
stains better suited for downstream tasks such as segmentation and profiling.

Motivation: 随着人口增长和气候变化加剧，粮食安全问题日益突出，需要创新解决方案提升农业可持续生产力。

Method: 定量评估现有基础模型在农业任务中的表现，提出农业专用基础模型（CropFM）的需求框架，并比较和评估两种代表性模型。

Result: 研究发现现有通用基础模型在农业任务中表现有限，凸显了开发农业专用基础模型的必要性。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁开发专门针对农业的基础模型，以更好地满足农业监测需求。

Abstract: Food security remains a global concern as population grows and climate change
intensifies, demanding innovative solutions for sustainable agricultural
productivity. Recent advances in foundation models have demonstrated remarkable
performance in remote sensing and climate sciences, and therefore offer new
opportunities for agricultural monitoring. However, their application in
challenges related to agriculture-such as crop type mapping, crop phenology
estimation, and crop yield estimation-remains under-explored. In this work, we
quantitatively evaluate existing foundational models to assess their
effectivity for a representative set of agricultural tasks. From an
agricultural domain perspective, we describe a requirements framework for an

existing general-purpose foundational models in this framework and empirically
evaluate two exemplary of them in three representative agriculture specific
tasks. Finally, we highlight the need for a dedicated foundational model
tailored specifically to agriculture.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning, particularly neural networks, have
significantly impacted a wide range of fields, including the automatic
enhancement of underwater images. This paper presents a deep learning-based
approach to improving underwater image quality by integrating human subjective
assessments into the training process. To this end, we utilize publicly
available datasets containing underwater images labeled by experts as either
high or low quality. Our method involves first training a classifier network to
distinguish between high- and low-quality images. Subsequently, generative
adversarial networks (GANs) are trained using various enhancement criteria to
refine the low-quality images. The performance of the GAN models is evaluated
using quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and UIQM, as well as through
qualitative analysis. Results demonstrate that the proposed model --
particularly when incorporating criteria such as color fidelity and image
sharpness -- achieves substantial improvements in both perceived and measured
image quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的个性化联邦学习方法在泛化能力上表现不足，尤其是在未见过的类别或领域上。

Method: pFedMMA通过多模态适配器（包含模态特定的上下投影层和全局共享投影层）和非对称优化策略，实现本地个性化与全局泛化的协同优化。

Result: 在11个数据集上的实验表明，pFedMMA在个性化和泛化之间取得了最佳平衡，优于现有联邦提示调优方法。

Conclusion: pFedMMA为视觉语言任务提供了一种高效、个性化的联邦学习解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to
decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has
emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated
learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of
personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this
work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework
that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter
contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally
shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our asymmetric optimization
strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions
while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global
generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared
component is exchanged during rounds. Through extensive experiments across
eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that
pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and
generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods. The code
is available at https://github.com/sajjad-ucsb/pFedMMA.

TL;DR: LoongX提出了一种基于多模态神经生理信号的无手图像编辑方法，利用扩散模型和脑机接口技术，性能接近文本驱动方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像编辑依赖手动提示，对运动或语言能力受限的用户不友好。LoongX旨在通过神经信号实现无障碍编辑。

Method: 结合EEG、fNIRS、PPG和头部运动信号，使用CS3模块编码特征，DGF模块融合特征，并通过DiT对齐编辑语义。

Result: LoongX性能接近文本驱动方法（CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558），结合语音时表现更优（CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549）。

Conclusion: 神经驱动生成模型为无障碍图像编辑提供了新方向，推动了认知驱动创意技术的发展。

Abstract: Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it
labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or
language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing
approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes
state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928
image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography
(EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography
(PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address
the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The
cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific
features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these
features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics
via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train
the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic
intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I:
0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural
signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results
highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling
accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for
cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to
support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.

Abstract: Motion generation, the task of synthesizing realistic motion sequences from
various conditioning inputs, has become a central problem in computer vision,
computer graphics, and robotics, with applications ranging from animation and
virtual agents to human-robot interaction. As the field has rapidly progressed
with the introduction of diverse modeling paradigms including GANs,
autoencoders, autoregressive models, and diffusion-based techniques, each
approach brings its own advantages and limitations. This growing diversity has
created a need for a comprehensive and structured review that specifically
examines recent developments from the perspective of the generative approach
employed.
  In this survey, we provide an in-depth categorization of motion generation
methods based on their underlying generative strategies. Our main focus is on
papers published in top-tier venues since 2023, reflecting the most recent
advancements in the field. In addition, we analyze architectural principles,
conditioning mechanisms, and generation settings, and compile a detailed
overview of the evaluation metrics and datasets used across the literature. Our
objective is to enable clearer comparisons and identify open challenges,
thereby offering a timely and foundational reference for researchers and
practitioners navigating the rapidly evolving landscape of motion generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D语义解析在局部编辑中表现不佳，限制了编辑的精确性和保真度，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 结合2D扩散编辑识别修改区域，逆渲染进行3D定位，并通过迭代优化逐步增强结构和纹理一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能上达到最优，并实现了4倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D场景局部编辑提供了更高效和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Many 3D scene editing tasks focus on modifying local regions rather than the
entire scene, except for some global applications like style transfer, and in
the context of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), where scenes are represented by a
series of Gaussians, this structure allows for precise regional edits, offering
enhanced control over specific areas of the scene; however, the challenge lies
in the fact that 3D semantic parsing often underperforms compared to its 2D
counterpart, making targeted manipulations within 3D spaces more difficult and
limiting the fidelity of edits, which we address by leveraging 2D diffusion
editing to accurately identify modification regions in each view, followed by
inverse rendering for 3D localization, then refining the frontal view and
initializing a coarse 3DGS with consistent views and approximate shapes derived
from depth maps predicted by a 2D foundation model, thereby supporting an
iterative, view-consistent editing process that gradually enhances structural
details and textures to ensure coherence across perspectives. Experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering up to a $4\times$ speedup, providing a more efficient and effective
approach to 3D scene local editing.

Abstract: The ability to segment objects based on open-ended language prompts remains a
critical challenge, requiring models to ground textual semantics into precise
spatial masks while handling diverse and unseen categories. We present
OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model
v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings
extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is
guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a
diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language
descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks.
ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we
train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving
remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's
spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and
cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances.
iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities,
generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts
without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic,
instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks, including
ADE20k, PASCAL, ScanNet, and SUN-RGBD.

Abstract: Uniform and excessive herbicide application in modern agriculture contributes
to increased input costs, environmental pollution, and the emergence of
herbicide resistant weeds. To address these challenges, we developed a vision
guided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system capable of detecting weed
presence, estimating canopy size, and dynamically adjusting nozzle activation
in real time. The system integrates lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep
learning models, deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for onboard inference,
and uses an Arduino Uno-based relay interface to control solenoid actuated
nozzles based on canopy segmentation results. Indoor trials were conducted
using 15 potted Hibiscus rosa sinensis plants of varying canopy sizes to
simulate a range of weed patch scenarios. The YOLO11n model achieved a mean
average precision (mAP@50) of 0.98, with a precision of 0.99 and a recall close
to 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision
of 0.55, and recall of 0.52. System performance was validated using water
sensitive paper, which showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones
where canopy was present. An upward trend in mean spray coverage from 16.22%
for small canopies to 21.46% and 21.65% for medium and large canopies,
respectively, demonstrated the system's capability to adjust spray output based
on canopy size in real time. These results highlight the potential of combining
real time deep learning with low-cost embedded hardware for selective herbicide
application. Future work will focus on expanding the detection capabilities to
include three common weed species in South Dakota: water hemp (Amaranthus
tuberculatus), kochia (Bassia scoparia), and foxtail (Setaria spp.), followed
by further validation in both indoor and field trials within soybean and corn
production systems.

Conclusion: 该研究为开发可扩展、非侵入性的监测系统提供了基础，有助于减轻老龄化社会中认知衰退的社会和经济负担。

Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers
from Naturalistic driving videos and large vision models. In recent times,
cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly
nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior
captured through in-vehicle systems, this research aims to extract "digital
fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of
MCI and AD. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights
from everyday driving patterns of older patients to early detect cognitive
decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic
driving videos to analyze driver behavior, classify cognitive status and
predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between
real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status
of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our
method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to
proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and
supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to
mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the
aging population.

Motivation: 自然图像的统计特性具有尺度不变性，而传统扩散模型使用的白噪声与自然图像特性不符，因此提出使用尺度不变噪声以更好地匹配自然图像。

Method: 在扩散模型中引入尺度不变噪声（而非白噪声），构建Cloud Diffusion Model，强调大尺度相关性并弱化小尺度相关性。

Result: 预计Cloud Diffusion Model能实现更快的推理速度、更优的高频细节和更高的可控性。

Conclusion: 通过使用尺度不变噪声，Cloud Diffusion Model有望在图像生成任务中超越传统白噪声扩散模型。

Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation function by progressively adding noise
to an image set and training a model to separate out the signal from the noise.
The noise profile used by these models is white noise -- that is, noise based
on independent normal distributions at each point whose mean and variance is
independent of the scale. By contrast, most natural image sets exhibit a type
of scale invariance in their low-order statistical properties characterized by
a power-law scaling. Consequently, natural images are closer (in a quantifiable
sense) to a different probability distribution that emphasizes large scale
correlations and de-emphasizes small scale correlations. These scale invariant
noise profiles can be incorporated into diffusion models in place of white
noise to form what we will call a ``Cloud Diffusion Model". We argue that these
models can lead to faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and
greater controllability. In a follow-up paper, we will build and train a Cloud
Diffusion Model that uses scale invariance at a fundamental level and compare
it to classic, white noise diffusion models.

Result: 在15秒内生成16个高质量一致视图，图像质量和重建指标优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LoomNet在多视图生成和3D重建中表现出色，具有创造性和高效性。

Abstract: Generating consistent multi-view images from a single image remains
challenging. Lack of spatial consistency often degrades 3D mesh quality in
surface reconstruction. To address this, we propose LoomNet, a novel multi-view
diffusion architecture that produces coherent images by applying the same
diffusion model multiple times in parallel to collaboratively build and
leverage a shared latent space for view consistency. Each viewpoint-specific
inference generates an encoding representing its own hypothesis of the novel
view from a given camera pose, which is projected onto three orthogonal planes.
For each plane, encodings from all views are fused into a single aggregated
plane. These aggregated planes are then processed to propagate information and
interpolate missing regions, combining the hypotheses into a unified, coherent
interpretation. The final latent space is then used to render consistent
multi-view images. LoomNet generates 16 high-quality and coherent views in just
15 seconds. In our experiments, LoomNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
both image quality and reconstruction metrics, also showing creativity by
producing diverse, plausible novel views from the same input.

Conclusion: ReLayout通过关系定义和原型重平衡，显著提升了布局生成的结构合理性和多样性。

Abstract: Content-aware layout aims to arrange design elements appropriately on a given
canvas to convey information effectively. Recently, the trend for this task has
been to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts
automatically, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based
methods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes
and design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout
generation. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that
leverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent
layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we
enhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such
as region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing
the layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling
the generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined
relationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines
layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct
layout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that
arise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive
experimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can
generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human
aesthetics and more explainable.

Motivation: 多模态FAS面临训练与测试域分布差异大及模态缺失的挑战，而真实人脸的特征差异较小且跨模态转换更一致。

Method: 通过一致跨模态特征转换构建通用特征空间，并学习不一致转换以检测OOD攻击；同时从RGB模态学习补充IR和深度特征。

Result: CTNet在大多数协议中优于之前的两类多模态FAS方法。

Conclusion: CTNet有效解决了多模态FAS中的分布差异和模态缺失问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to detect genuine human presence by
extracting discriminative liveness cues from multiple modalities, such as RGB,
infrared (IR), and depth images, to enhance the robustness of biometric
authentication systems. However, because data from different modalities are
typically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental
conditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution
discrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS.
Furthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater
challenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this
paper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to
tackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from
that, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are
typically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature
transitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared
to those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose
learning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to
construct a generalized feature space. Next, we introduce learning the
inconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to
effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks during inference. To
further address the issue of missing modalities, we propose learning
complementary infrared (IR) and depth features from the RGB modality as
auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CTNet
outperforms previous two-class multi-modal FAS methods across most protocols.

Abstract: In the realm of industrial quality inspection, defect detection stands as a
critical component, particularly in high-precision, safety-critical sectors
such as automotive components aerospace, and medical devices. Traditional
methods, reliant on manual inspection or early image processing algorithms,
suffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and limited robustness. This paper
introduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional
diffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a
staged joint optimization strategy. The framework utilizes labeled data for
initial training and subsequently incorporates unlabeled data through the
generation of pseudo-labels. A conditional diffusion model synthesizes
multi-scale pseudo-defect samples, while a CLIP cross-modal feature-based noise
filtering mechanism mitigates label contamination. Experimental results on the
NEU-DET dataset demonstrate a 78.4% mAP@0.5 with the same amount of labeled
data as traditional supervised methods, and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% of the
labeled data required by the original supervised model, showcasing significant
advantages in data efficiency. This research provides a high-precision,
low-labeling-dependent solution for defect detection in industrial quality
inspection scenarios. The work of this article has been open-sourced at

TL;DR: GSVR是一种基于2D高斯的新型视频表示方法，通过混合变形场和动态感知时间切片策略，显著提升了视频解码速度和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频表示方法在解码速度和训练时间上表现不佳，GSVR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出混合变形场建模视频动态，动态感知时间切片策略自适应划分视频，量化感知微调避免性能下降。

Result: 在Bunny和UVG数据集上，GSVR解码速度提升10倍，训练时间大幅缩短，视频压缩性能优于NeRV。

Conclusion: GSVR在视频表示和解码速度上具有显著优势，适用于视频压缩和插值任务。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations for video have been recognized as a novel and
promising form of video representation. Existing works pay more attention to
improving video reconstruction quality but little attention to the decoding
speed. However, the high computation of convolutional network used in existing
methods leads to low decoding speed. Moreover, these convolution-based video
representation methods also suffer from long training time, about 14 seconds
per frame to achieve 35+ PSNR on Bunny. To solve the above problems, we propose
GSVR, a novel 2D Gaussian-based video representation, which achieves 800+ FPS
and 35+ PSNR on Bunny, only needing a training time of $2$ seconds per frame.
Specifically, we propose a hybrid deformation field to model the dynamics of
the video, which combines two motion patterns, namely the tri-plane motion and
the polynomial motion, to deal with the coupling of camera motion and object
motion in the video. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing
strategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP)
based on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion
and non-rigid movements. Finally, we propose quantization-aware fine-tuning to
avoid performance reduction after quantization and utilize image codecs to
compress Gaussians to achieve a compact representation. Experiments on the
Bunny and UVG datasets confirm that our method converges much faster than
existing methods and also has 10x faster decoding speed compared to other
methods. Our method has comparable performance in the video interpolation task
to SOTA and attains better video compression performance than NeRV.

TL;DR: Accordion是一个图形设计生成框架，首次尝试将AI生成的设计转换为可编辑的分层设计，并通过用户提示优化无意义的AI生成文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的设计缺乏可编辑性，但能启发设计师的布局和文本风格选择，因此需要一种方法将其转换为可编辑的分层设计。

Method: 采用视觉语言模型（VLM）分三个阶段执行任务，结合SAM和元素移除模型等视觉专家，以自上而下的方式分解图层。

Result: 在DesignIntention基准测试中表现优异，包括文本到模板、背景添加文本和文本去渲染等任务，并能生成设计变体。

Conclusion: Accordion成功将AI生成的设计转换为可编辑的分层设计，并通过用户提示优化文本，为设计师提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Graphic design is crucial for conveying ideas and messages. Designers usually
organize their work into objects, backgrounds, and vectorized text layers to
simplify editing. However, this workflow demands considerable expertise. With
the rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in
pixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack
editability. Despite this, non-layered designs still inspire human designers,
influencing their choices in layouts and text styles, ultimately guiding the
creation of layered designs. Motivated by this observation, we propose
Accordion, a graphic design generation framework taking the first attempt to
convert AI-generated designs into editable layered designs, meanwhile refining
nonsensical AI-generated text with meaningful alternatives guided by user
prompts. It is built around a vision language model (VLM) playing distinct
roles in three curated stages. For each stage, we design prompts to guide the
VLM in executing different tasks. Distinct from existing bottom-up methods
(e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered
designs, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually
harmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer.
Additionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element
removal models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers. We train our
method using the in-house graphic design dataset Design39K, augmented with
AI-generated design images coupled with refined ground truth created by a
customized inpainting model. Experimental results and user studies by designers
show that Accordion generates favorable results on the DesignIntention
benchmark, including tasks such as text-to-template, adding text to background,
and text de-rendering, and also excels in creating design variations.

TL;DR: Kernel Density Steering (KDS) 是一种新型推理框架，通过显式局部模式搜索提升扩散模型的图像恢复质量，减少伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像恢复中常出现不一致的保真度和不良伪影，KDS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: KDS使用N粒子扩散样本集合，通过核密度估计梯度引导样本向高密度区域移动，避免伪影。

Result: KDS显著提升了超分辨率和图像修复任务的定量和定性性能。

Conclusion: KDS是一种无需重新训练或外部验证的即插即用框架，能有效提升扩散模型的输出质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for image restoration, but existing methods
often struggle with inconsistent fidelity and undesirable artifacts. To address
this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time
framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local
mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples,
computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective
outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared,
higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local
mode-seeking mechanism, acting as "collective wisdom", steers samples away from
spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model
imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows
us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by
simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS
requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with
various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS
substantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on
challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.

Motivation: 在VR/AR中，由于难以获取面部状态的真实数据，现有方法依赖昂贵的配对数据收集，且无法复用。

Method: 提出GenHMC方法，利用未配对的HMC数据生成合成图像，解耦面部表情和外观。

Result: 方法能生成更准确的真实数据，并泛化到未见过的身份，提高了数据效率和准确性。

Conclusion: GenHMC通过解耦和泛化能力，为VR/AR头像动画提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Enabling photorealistic avatar animations in virtual and augmented reality
(VR/AR) has been challenging because of the difficulty of obtaining ground
truth state of faces. It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images
from head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations
in infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full
observations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on
analysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer
from imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their
personalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome)
for the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale
datasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In
this work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC),
that leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect,
to directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning
avatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly
disentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and
viewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth.
Furthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the
reliance on the paired captures. We demonstrate these breakthroughs by both
evaluating synthetic HMC images and universal face encoders trained from these
new HMC-avatar correspondences, which achieve better data efficiency and
state-of-the-art accuracy.

Motivation: 现有方法在领域特定图像生成中存在语义理解与视觉表示分离、语义约束不足的问题，导致生成结果出现幻觉和语义偏差。

Method: 结合矩阵提示优化与多视角理解，设计跨模态适应机制和两阶段标题语义转换，确保语义一致性和视觉多样性。

Result: 在40个类别上仅需每类16张图像即实现显著改进，图像质量、多样性和语义一致性均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AdaptaGen框架有效解决了领域特定图像生成中的关键问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Domain-specific image generation aims to produce high-quality visual content
for specialized fields while ensuring semantic accuracy and detail fidelity.
However, existing methods exhibit two critical limitations: First, current
approaches address prompt engineering and model adaptation separately,
overlooking the inherent dependence between semantic understanding and visual
representation in specialized domains. Second, these techniques inadequately
incorporate domain-specific semantic constraints during content synthesis,
resulting in generation outcomes that exhibit hallucinations and semantic
deviations. To tackle these issues, we propose AdaptaGen, a hierarchical
semantic optimization framework that integrates matrix-based prompt
optimization with multi-perspective understanding, capturing comprehensive
semantic relationships from both global and local perspectives. To mitigate
hallucinations in specialized domains, we design a cross-modal adaptation
mechanism, which, when combined with intelligent content synthesis, enables
preserving core thematic elements while incorporating diverse details across
images. Additionally, we introduce a two-phase caption semantic transformation
during the generation phase. This approach maintains semantic coherence while
enhancing visual diversity, ensuring the generated images adhere to
domain-specific constraints. Experimental results confirm our approach's
effectiveness, with our framework achieving superior performance across 40
categories from diverse datasets using only 16 images per category,
demonstrating significant improvements in image quality, diversity, and
semantic consistency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于焦点映射的特征提取器（OFFSET），用于解决组合图像检索中的视觉数据不均匀性和文本数据优先级问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合图像检索（CIR）能灵活表达用户需求，但现有方法因忽略视觉数据的不均匀性和文本数据的优先级，导致查询特征退化和视觉焦点偏差。

Method: 设计了主导部分分割和双焦点映射模块，以减少噪声干扰；并提出文本引导的焦点修正模块，增强对修改焦点的感知。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验验证了OFFSET的优越性。

Conclusion: OFFSET通过改进特征提取和焦点修正，显著提升了组合图像检索的性能。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) represents a novel retrieval paradigm that is
capable of expressing users' intricate retrieval requirements flexibly. It
enables the user to give a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a
modification text, and subsequently retrieve the target image. Notwithstanding
the considerable advances made by prevailing methodologies, CIR remains in its
nascent stages due to two limitations: 1) inhomogeneity between dominant and
noisy portions in visual data is ignored, leading to query feature degradation,
and 2) the priority of textual data in the image modification process is
overlooked, which leads to a visual focus bias. To address these two
limitations, this work presents a focus mapping-based feature extractor, which
consists of two modules: dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping.
It is designed to identify significant dominant portions in images and guide
the extraction of visual and textual data features, thereby reducing the impact
of noise interference. Subsequently, we propose a textually guided focus
revision module, which can utilize the modification requirements implied in the
text to perform adaptive focus revision on the reference image, thereby
enhancing the perception of the modification focus on the composed features.
The aforementioned modules collectively constitute the segmentatiOn-based Focus
shiFt reviSion nETwork (\mbox{OFFSET}), and comprehensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets substantiate the superiority of our proposed method. The
codes and data are available on https://zivchen-ty.github.io/OFFSET.github.io/

Motivation: 传统实值扩散模型在PolSAR数据中难以捕获复相位信息且细节结构保留不足，需要改进。

Method: 利用Contourlet变换分解数据为低频和高频子带，设计知识引导的复扩散网络建模低频统计特性，并用高频结构信息指导扩散过程。

Result: 在三个真实PolSAR数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在边缘细节保留和复杂地形区域同质性维持方面。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合Contourlet变换和知识引导的复扩散模型，显著提升了PolSAR图像分类性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performance across various
domains due to their ability to model and generate complicated data
distributions. However, when applied to PolSAR data, traditional real-valued
diffusion models face challenges in capturing complex-valued phase
information.Moreover, these models often struggle to preserve fine structural
details. To address these limitations, we leverage the Contourlet transform,
which provides rich multiscale and multidirectional representations well-suited
for PolSAR imagery. We propose a structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion
model for PolSAR image classification in the Contourlet domain. Specifically,
the complex Contourlet transform is first applied to decompose the data into
low- and high-frequency subbands, enabling the extraction of statistical and
boundary features. A knowledge-guided complex diffusion network is then
designed to model the statistical properties of the low-frequency components.
During the process, structural information from high-frequency coefficients is
utilized to guide the diffusion process, improving edge preservation.
Furthermore, multiscale and multidirectional high-frequency features are
jointly learned to further boost classification accuracy. Experimental results
on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving edge details and
maintaining region homogeneity in complex terrain.

Motivation: 现有基于提示和适配器的方法在微调视觉语言模型时难以保持对新类别的泛化能力，原因是平等处理所有特征导致过拟合。

Result: 实验表明DRA在多个基准测试中显著提升新类别性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DRA有效解决了新类别泛化问题，为视觉语言模型微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP demonstrate
impressive generalization ability. Existing prompt-based and adapter-based
works have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the
challenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards
unseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating
all tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting
on less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and
degrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept
recognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a
novel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class
generalization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the
importance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first
employs token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and
group tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to
the importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature
ranks to the more important tokens. Also, we design a new channel response
mechanism to prioritize the preservation and adaptation of feature channels
identified as the most informative for each instance. In addition, a L1
regularization term is introduced to stabilize the training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DRA
over existing works, especially on enhancing the performance of new classes on
various benchmarks, including base-new classes, cross-datasets evaluation and
domain generalization. The source code will be published after the paper is
received.

Abstract: Brain lesions are abnormalities or injuries in brain tissue that are often
detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which reveals structural
changes in the affected areas. This broad definition of brain lesions includes
areas of the brain that are irreversibly damaged, as well as areas of brain
tissue that are deformed as a result of lesion growth or swelling. Despite the
importance of differentiating between damaged and deformed tissue, existing
lesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as
a single anomaly. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model-based framework
for analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process. Our pipeline first
segments abnormal regions in the brain, then estimates and reverses tissue
deformations by restoring displaced tissue to its original position, isolating
the core lesion area representing the initial damage. Finally, we inpaint the
core lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain.
This proposed framework reverses a forward lesion growth process model that is
well-established in biomechanical studies that model brain lesions. Our results
demonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and
brain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for
clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis. Since pre-lesion
healthy versions of abnormal brains are not available in any public dataset for
validation of the reverse process, we simulate a forward model to synthesize
multiple lesioned brain images.

Abstract: Visual agent models for automating human activities on Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs) have emerged as a promising research direction, driven by
advances in large Vision Language Models (VLMs). A critical challenge in GUI
automation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse
platforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large
and cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant
information that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches
typically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives,
which fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established
object detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these
issues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages
zoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization. We also propose an
IoU-aware objective function that facilitates model convergence toward high IoU
predictions. Our approach bridges the gap between VLMs and conventional object
detection techniques, improving the state-of-the-art grounding accuracy by 13%
across diverse GUI platforms on the GUI grounding benchmarks ScreenSpot and
AgentStudio. In addition, our R-VLM approach shows 3.2-9.7% absolute accuracy
improvements in GUI navigation tasks on the AITW and Mind2Web benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in
open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely
underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical
training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity
but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce
unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due
to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical
domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first
large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It
comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios,
providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation
models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading
performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across
multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our
dataset and model can serve as a valuable resource and help catalyze further
research in medical video generation. Our code and data is available at

Conclusion: ISP通过结构建模和动态损失调整，显著提升了VLM的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Prompt learning methods have significantly extended the transferability of
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream
tasks. These methods adopt handcraft templates or learnable vectors to provide
text or image instructions in fine-tuning VLMs. However, most existing works
ignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within
and between modalities. Moreover, balancing the performance of base and new
classes remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an
Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of
information representations between the text and image branches. ISP introduces
self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural
relationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across
modalities. This enables efficient information transfer while preserving
feature stability. Additionally, we propose a sample probing module that
dynamically adjusts loss coefficients based on sample difficulty, preventing
the mode from overfitting to simple samples and improving generalization
ability to new classes. Extensive experiments on three widely used settings:
base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization
demonstrate that the proposed ISP achieves competitive performance against
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LiON-LoRA为视频扩散模型提供了更精确和稳定的控制方法。

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
synthesizing realistic videos by learning from large-scale data. Although
vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal
movement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over
both camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the
unstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose
LiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core
principles: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we
analyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling
decoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced
across layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations.
Third, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT)
to linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a
modified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we
extend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos,
unifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that
LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy
and motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal
training data. Project Page: https://fuchengsu.github.io/lionlora.github.io/

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合RGB和事件传感器的融合方法，用于航天器姿态估计，解决了单一传感器在极端光照条件下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航天器姿态估计对自主在轨操作至关重要，但传统RGB传感器在极端光照条件下表现不佳，而事件传感器虽动态范围高，但空间分辨率低。

Method: 使用光束分离棱镜实现光学和时间对齐，开发基于RANSAC的融合技术，结合RGB和事件数据，并引入dropout不确定性估计。

Result: 在实验室收集的多样化光照条件下数据集上验证了方法的有效性，支持事件传感器在姿态估计中的应用。

Conclusion: 事件-RGB融合方法有效解决了极端光照问题，数据集将公开以促进社区研究。

Abstract: Spacecraft pose estimation is crucial for autonomous in-space operations,
such as rendezvous, docking and on-orbit servicing. Vision-based pose
estimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling
solution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting
conditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure,
blooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic
or event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However,
event sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced
signal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work
addresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion
approach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to
achieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique
was developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to
achieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The
pipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme
conditions that affect either channel. To benchmark the performance of the
proposed event-RGB fusion method, we collected a comprehensive real dataset of
RGB and event data for satellite pose estimation in a laboratory setting under
a variety of challenging illumination conditions. Encouraging results on the
dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our event-RGB fusion approach and further
supports the usage of event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation. To support
community research on this topic, our dataset will be released publicly.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images are high-dimensional datasets consisting of hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling detailed material and surface analysis.
Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) refers to the technique of identifying
and locating anomalous targets in such data without prior information about a
hyperspectral scene or target spectrum. This technology has seen rapid
advancements in recent years, with applications in agriculture, defence,
military surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Despite this significant
progress, existing HAD methods continue to face challenges such as high
computational complexity, sensitivity to noise, and limited generalisation
across diverse datasets. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of
various HAD techniques, categorising them into statistical models,
representation-based methods, classical machine learning approaches, and deep
learning models. We evaluated these methods across 17 benchmarking datasets
using different performance metrics, such as ROC, AUC, and separability map to
analyse detection accuracy, computational efficiency, their strengths,
limitations, and directions for future research.The research shows that deep
learning models achieved the highest detection accuracy, while statistical
models demonstrated exceptional speed across all datasets. This study aims to
provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working to advance
the field of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods.

TL;DR: SenseShift6D是一个新的RGB-D数据集，用于研究传感器控制和光照变化对6D物体姿态估计的影响，实验表明传感器控制能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集在固定光照和相机设置下采集，未考虑真实世界中的变化，SenseShift6D填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过物理调整13种RGB曝光、9种RGB增益、自动曝光、4种深度模式和5种光照水平，生成多样化的数据。

Result: 测试时传感器控制比数据增强更有效，多模态RGB-D配置联合调整效果最佳。

Conclusion: SenseShift6D为自适应感知系统提供了基础，扩展了6D姿态估计的评估范式。

Abstract: Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation has achieved high performance on
representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these
datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving
the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or
depth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate
such variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,
9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.
For three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire
101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting
permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our
dataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater
performance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance
comparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data
quantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is
effective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even
greater improvements. SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from
data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive,
self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain
real-world environments. Our dataset is available at:

Abstract: The acquisition of accurately coloured, balanced images in an optical
microscope can be a challenge even for experienced microscope operators. This
article presents an entirely automatic mechanism for balancing the white level
that allows the correction of the microscopic colour images adequately. The
results of the algorithm have been confirmed experimentally on a set of two
hundred microscopic images. The images contained scans of three microscopic
specimens commonly used in pathomorphology. Also, the results achieved were
compared with other commonly used white balance algorithms in digital
photography. The algorithm applied in this work is more effective than the
classical algorithms used in colour photography for microscopic images stained
with hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron and for immunohistochemical staining images.

Abstract: Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial
yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR.
Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture,
neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural
reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense
multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we
introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity,
interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a
three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D
object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D
segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video
diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable
part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by
occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by
a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to
ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results
demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated
objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and
plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated
asset generation. Our project page is available at

Abstract: Virtual try-on has made significant progress in recent years. This paper
addresses how to achieve multifunctional virtual try-on guided solely by text
instructions, including full outfit change and local editing. Previous methods
primarily relied on end-to-end networks to perform single try-on tasks, lacking
versatility and flexibility. We propose TalkFashion, an intelligent try-on
assistant that leverages the powerful comprehension capabilities of large
language models to analyze user instructions and determine which task to
execute, thereby activating different processing pipelines accordingly.
Additionally, we introduce an instruction-based local repainting model that
eliminates the need for users to manually provide masks. With the help of
multi-modal models, this approach achieves fully automated local editings,
enhancing the flexibility of editing tasks. The experimental results
demonstrate better semantic consistency and visual quality compared to the
current methods.

TL;DR: SPADE框架通过空间感知去噪网络改进开放词汇全景场景图生成，解决了预训练视觉语言模型在空间关系推理中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在开放词汇设置中依赖预训练视觉语言模型，但忽视了其在空间关系推理中的不足，如难以区分物体相对位置。

Method: SPADE框架包括两个关键步骤：(1) 基于反演引导的UNet校准，(2) 空间感知上下文推理。

Result: 在PSG和Visual Genome数据集上，SPADE在封闭和开放场景中均优于现有方法，尤其在空间关系预测上表现突出。

Conclusion: SPADE通过空间感知和上下文推理显著提升了全景场景图生成的性能。

Abstract: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) integrates instance segmentation with
relation understanding to capture pixel-level structural relationships in
complex scenes. Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the
open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs
in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object
relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated
by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial
structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork)
framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two
key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2)
spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general
pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with
cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based
fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation
graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual
information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries.
Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate
that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set
scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.

Abstract: Document reconstruction constitutes a significant facet of document analysis
and recognition, a field that has been progressively accruing interest within
the scholarly community. A multitude of these researchers employ an array of
document understanding models to generate predictions on distinct subtasks,
subsequently integrating their results into a holistic document reconstruction
format via heuristic principles. Nevertheless, these multi-stage methodologies
are hindered by the phenomenon of error propagation, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Furthermore, contemporary studies utilize generative models to
extract the logical sequence of plain text, tables and mathematical expressions
in an end-to-end process. However, this approach is deficient in preserving the
information related to element layouts, which are vital for document
reconstruction. To surmount these aforementioned limitations, we in this paper
present an innovative autoregressive model specifically designed for document
reconstruction, referred to as Document Reconstruction via End-to-end
Autoregressive Model (DREAM). DREAM transmutes the text image into a sequence
of document reconstruction in a comprehensive, end-to-end process,
encapsulating a broader spectrum of document element information. In addition,
we establish a standardized definition of the document reconstruction task, and
introduce a novel Document Similarity Metric (DSM) and DocRec1K dataset for
assessing the performance of the task. Empirical results substantiate that our
methodology attains unparalleled performance in the realm of document
reconstruction. Furthermore, the results on a variety of subtasks, encompassing
document layout analysis, text recognition, table structure recognition,
formula recognition and reading order detection, indicate that our model is
competitive and compatible with various tasks.

Abstract: The development of safe and robust autonomous driving functions is heavily
dependent on large-scale, high-quality sensor data. However, real-word data
acquisition demands intensive human labor and is strongly limited by factors
such as labeling cost, driver safety protocols and diverse scenario coverage.
Thus, multiple lines of work focus on the conditional generation of synthetic
camera sensor data. We identify a significant gap in research regarding daytime
variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels. Consequently,
we present the solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily
computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the
need for extensive manual labeling. Our work is complemented by a tailored
normalization approach, targeting the sensitivity of daylight towards small
numeric changes in altitude. We demonstrate its ability to accurately capture
lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context
of diffusion models.

Abstract: As critical transportation infrastructure, bridges face escalating challenges
from aging and deterioration, while traditional manual inspection methods
suffer from low efficiency. Although 3D point cloud technology provides a new
data-driven paradigm, its application potential is often constrained by the
incompleteness of real-world data, which results from missing labels and
scanning occlusions. To overcome the bottleneck of insufficient generalization
in existing synthetic data methods, this paper proposes a systematic framework
for generating 3D bridge data.
  This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring
component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal
vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and
physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training
of segmentation and completion networks, respectively. Experiments demonstrate
that a PointNet++ model trained with our synthetic data achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.2% in real-world bridge semantic
segmentation. Concurrently, a fine-tuned KT-Net exhibits superior performance
on the component completion task.
  This research offers an innovative methodology and a foundational dataset for
the 3D visual analysis of bridge structures, holding significant implications
for advancing the automated management and maintenance of infrastructure.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved significant progress in advancing 2D image
editing, demonstrating exceptional precision and realism. However, they often
struggle with consistency and object identity preservation due to their
inherent pixel-manipulation nature. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel "2D-3D-2D" framework. Our approach begins by lifting 2D objects into 3D
representation, enabling edits within a physically plausible,
rigidity-constrained 3D environment. The edited 3D objects are then reprojected
and seamlessly inpainted back into the original 2D image. In contrast to
existing 2D editing methods, such as DragGAN and DragDiffusion, our method
directly manipulates objects in a 3D environment. Extensive experiments
highlight that our framework surpasses previous methods in general performance,
delivering highly consistent edits while robustly preserving object identity.

Abstract: Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening
but fall short in high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future
prediction, a limitation rooted in their lack of commonsense world knowledge.
To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically
fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with
a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our
key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the
Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric
visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables
the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual
evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with
large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted
instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced
reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks.
Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning
tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of
each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine
perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding,
paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics,
human-computer interaction, and beyond.

Abstract: The annotation bottleneck in semantic segmentation has driven significant
interest in few-shot segmentation, which aims to develop segmentation models
capable of generalizing rapidly to novel classes using minimal exemplars.
Conventional training paradigms typically generate query prior maps by
extracting masked-area features from support images, followed by making
predictions guided by these prior maps. However, current approaches remain
constrained by two critical limitations stemming from inter- and intra-image
discrepancies, both of which significantly degrade segmentation performance: 1)
The semantic gap between support and query images results in mismatched
features and inaccurate prior maps; 2) Visually similar yet semantically
distinct regions within support or query images lead to false negative or false
positive predictions. We propose a novel FSS method called \textbf{I$^2$R}: 1)
Using category-specific high level representations which aggregate global
semantic cues from support and query images, enabling more precise inter-image
region localization and address the first limitation. 2) Directional masking
strategy that suppresses inconsistent support-query pixel pairs, which exhibit
high feature similarity but conflicting mask, to mitigate the second issue.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving improvements of 1.9\% and 2.1\% in mIoU under the 1-shot
setting on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ benchmarks, respectively.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) virtual staining is a task that generates virtual
IHC images from H\&E images while maintaining pathological semantic consistency
with adjacent slices. This task aims to achieve cross-domain mapping between
morphological structures and staining patterns through generative models,
providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for pathological analysis.
However, under weakly paired conditions, spatial heterogeneity between adjacent
slices presents significant challenges. This can lead to inaccurate one-to-many
mappings and generate results that are inconsistent with the pathological
semantics of adjacent slices. To address this issue, we propose a novel
unbalanced self-information feature transport for IHC virtual staining, named
USIGAN, which extracts global morphological semantics without relying on
positional correspondence.By removing weakly paired terms in the joint marginal
distribution, we effectively mitigate the impact of weak pairing on joint
distributions, thereby significantly improving the content consistency and
pathological semantic consistency of the generated results. Moreover, we design
the Unbalanced Optimal Transport Consistency (UOT-CTM) mechanism and the
Pathology Self-Correspondence (PC-SCM) mechanism to construct correlation
matrices between H\&E and generated IHC in image-level and real IHC and
generated IHC image sets in intra-group level.. Experiments conducted on two
publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance across multiple clinically significant metrics, such as IoD and
Pearson-R correlation, demonstrating better clinical relevance.

*Juli Zhang,Zeyu Yan,Jing Zhang,Qiguang Miao,Quan Wang*

TL;DR: DFYP是一种动态融合框架，通过光谱通道注意力、边缘自适应空间建模和学习融合机制，提升作物产量预测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在空间建模能力、跨作物和年份泛化性上的不足。

Method: 结合分辨率感知通道注意力模块（RCA）、自适应算子学习网络（AOL-Net）和双分支架构，动态优化特征提取与融合。

Result: 在MODIS和Sentinel-2数据集上，DFYP在RMSE、MAE和R2指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DFYP在多样化农业场景中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，适用于实际农业监测。

Abstract: Accurate remote sensing-based crop yield prediction remains a fundamental
challenging task due to complex spatial patterns, heterogeneous spectral
characteristics, and dynamic agricultural conditions. Existing methods often
suffer from limited spatial modeling capacity, weak generalization across crop
types and years. To address these challenges, we propose DFYP, a novel Dynamic
Fusion framework for crop Yield Prediction, which combines spectral channel
attention, edge-adaptive spatial modeling and a learnable fusion mechanism to
improve robustness across diverse agricultural scenarios. Specifically, DFYP
introduces three key components: (1) a Resolution-aware Channel Attention (RCA)
module that enhances spectral representation by adaptively reweighting input
channels based on resolution-specific characteristics; (2) an Adaptive Operator
Learning Network (AOL-Net) that dynamically selects operators for convolutional
kernels to improve edge-sensitive spatial feature extraction under varying crop
and temporal conditions; and (3) a dual-branch architecture with a learnable
fusion mechanism, which jointly models local spatial details and global
contextual information to support cross-resolution and cross-crop
generalization. Extensive experiments on multi-year datasets MODIS and
multi-crop dataset Sentinel-2 demonstrate that DFYP consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and R2 across different
spatial resolutions, crop types, and time periods, showcasing its effectiveness
and robustness for real-world agricultural monitoring.

Result: 实验表明，D-FCGS在保持视觉质量的同时，实现了超过40倍的压缩，且无需逐场景优化。

Conclusion: D-FCGS为动态3D高斯点云的前馈压缩提供了新思路，推动了FVV在沉浸式应用中的可扩展传输与存储。

Abstract: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive 3D experiences, but efficient
compression of dynamic 3D representations remains a major challenge. Recent
advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its dynamic extensions have
enabled high-fidelity scene modeling. However, existing methods often couple
scene reconstruction with optimization-dependent coding, which limits
generalizability. This paper presents Feedforward Compression of Dynamic
Gaussian Splatting (D-FCGS), a novel feedforward framework for compressing
temporally correlated Gaussian point cloud sequences. Our approach introduces a
Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P frame coding, where inter-frame
motions are extracted via sparse control points. The resulting motion tensors
are compressed in a feedforward manner using a dual prior-aware entropy model
that combines hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate
estimation. For reconstruction, we perform control-point-guided motion
compensation and employ a refinement network to enhance view-consistent
fidelity. Trained on multi-view video-derived Gaussian frames, D-FCGS
generalizes across scenes without per-scene optimization. Experiments show that
it matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods,
achieving over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds while preserving visual
quality across viewpoints. This work advances feedforward compression for
dynamic 3DGS, paving the way for scalable FVV transmission and storage in
immersive applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感视觉语言模型（RS-VLMs）局限于图像和区域级任务，缺乏像素级处理能力，且计算资源消耗高，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出GeoMag框架，采用任务驱动的多粒度分辨率调整（TMRA）和提示引导的语义感知裁剪（PSC），动态优化任务相关区域的视觉表示。

Result: 在10个基准测试中，GeoMag在像素级任务表现出色，同时在其他粒度任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: GeoMag通过动态注意力机制和语义裁剪，显著提升了遥感图像解析的效率和性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) image
understanding has achieved notable progress, demonstrating the basic ability to
recognize and describe geographical entities. However, existing RS-VLMs are
mostly limited to image-level and region-level tasks, lacking the capability to
handle pixel-level tasks and performing poorly in small-object recognition
scenarios. Moreover, RS-VLMs consume significant computational resources when
processing high-resolution RS images, further restricting their practical
applicability. In this context, we propose GeoMag (Geographical Magnifier), an
end-to-end general-purpose large model framework for RS. GeoMag dynamically
focuses the attention scope based on prompt semantics to effectively perform
remote sensing image parsing across multiple levels of granularity. This method
introduces Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and
Prompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC), which adaptively reduce the
spatial resolution of task-irrelevant regions while enhancing the visual
representation of task-relevant areas. This approach improves the model's
perception of critical target regions, suppresses background redundancy, and
reduces the computational cost of interpreting high-resolution RS imagery.
Extensive comparative experiments on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that GeoMag not
only excels in handling pixel-level tasks but also maintains competitive
performance across tasks of other granularities compared to existing RS-VLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅解决了多模态数据缺失问题，还提升了跟踪性能，代码和基准将公开。

Abstract: Multimodal data is known to be helpful for visual tracking by improving
robustness to appearance variations. However, sensor synchronization challenges
often compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where
shortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on
tracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly,
under such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance
degradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to
effectively handle missing modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker
should dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates.
This is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion
mechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy
that ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness which is
critical for effective video tracking. Surprisingly, our model not only adapts
to varying missing rates but also adjusts to scene complexity. Extensive
experiments show that our model achieves SOTA performance across 9 benchmarks,
excelling in both conventional complete and missing modality settings. The code
and benchmark will be publicly available at

Motivation: 现有可解释人工智能（xAI）方法和评估指标最初为计算机视觉（CV）设计，直接用于遥感可能不适用，因此需要研究其在RS中的有效性。

Method: 方法学和实验分析了十种解释指标（涵盖五类）和五种特征归因方法（Occlusion、LIME、GradCAM、LRP、DeepLIFT），应用于三个RS数据集。

Conclusion: 提供了在RS图像场景分类中选择解释方法、指标和超参数的指南。

Abstract: The development of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for
scene classification problems has attracted great attention in remote sensing
(RS). Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially
developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their
direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper,
we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the
context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and
experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories
(faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to
five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP,
and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies
key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of
perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on
perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based
approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same
image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance
disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we
find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same
problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity
metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast,
robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater
stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings.
Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods,
metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型在处理高分辨率图像时面临视觉标记过多且无关的问题，需要一种无需额外标注的方法来提升定位能力。

Method: 采用多轮对话框架和强化学习，通过自动裁剪关键子图像来优化模型定位能力，仅使用二元奖励函数。

Result: MGPO在标准数据集上表现优于GRPO，并在OOD基准测试中超越OpenAI的o1和GPT-4o模型。

Conclusion: MGPO展示了强化学习在提升模型视觉定位能力方面的潜力，尤其在无标注数据的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: State-of-the-art large multi-modal models (LMMs) face challenges when
processing high-resolution images, as these inputs are converted into enormous
visual tokens, many of which are irrelevant to the downstream task. In this
paper, we propose Multi-turn Grounding-based Policy Optimization (MGPO), an
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables LMMs to
iteratively focus on key visual regions by automatically cropping sub-images,
based on model-predicted grounding coordinates within a multi-turn conversation
framework. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which requires costly
additional grounding annotations, our approach highlights that LMMs can emerge
robust grounding abilities during the RL training process, leveraging only a
binary reward function derived from the correctness of the final answer.
Additionally, we observe that LMMs struggle to autonomously trigger visual
grounding during the rollout process. To address this cold start problem, we
design a multi-turn conversational template and restrict policy loss
computation to model outputs generated across multiple dialogue rounds, thereby
promoting stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when
trained on standard visual-question-short answering data without grounding
annotations, MGPO effectively elicits stronger grounding capabilities compared
to GRPO, leading to 5.4\% improvement on in-distribution MME-Realworld and
5.2\% improvement on the challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) V* Bench.
Notably, MGPO post-training on Qwen2.5-VL-7B with 21K samples surpasses
OpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models on the OOD V* Bench. Codes are available at

Motivation: 视频实例分割（VIS）面临遮挡、运动模糊和外观变化等挑战，需增强鲁棒性。

Method: 提出三种集成深度估计的方法：EDC（扩展深度通道）、SV（共享ViT）和DS（深度监督）。

Result: EDC和SV显著提升了VIS性能，EDC在Swin-L骨干下达到56.2 AP，创下OVIS基准新纪录。

Conclusion: 深度信息是增强视频理解鲁棒性的关键因素。

Abstract: Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) fundamentally struggles with pervasive
challenges including object occlusions, motion blur, and appearance variations
during temporal association. To overcome these limitations, this work
introduces geometric awareness to enhance VIS robustness by strategically
leveraging monocular depth estimation. We systematically investigate three
distinct integration paradigms. Expanding Depth Channel (EDC) method
concatenates the depth map as input channel to segmentation networks; Sharing
ViT (SV) designs a uniform ViT backbone, shared between depth estimation and
segmentation branches; Depth Supervision (DS) makes use of depth prediction as
an auxiliary training guide for feature learning. Though DS exhibits limited
effectiveness, benchmark evaluations demonstrate that EDC and SV significantly
enhance the robustness of VIS. When with Swin-L backbone, our EDC method gets
56.2 AP, which sets a new state-of-the-art result on OVIS benchmark. This work
conclusively establishes depth cues as critical enablers for robust video
understanding.

Motivation: 密集3D特征体积在提高分辨率时效率低下，限制了重建质量，因此需要一种更高效的表示方法。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先生成体素占用预测，然后在高占用体素中进行特征计算和体积渲染，并开发了高效的稀疏体积算法。

Result: 存储需求减少50倍以上，支持512^3分辨率（通常为128^3），重建精度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 稀疏表示方法显著提升了神经表面重建的分辨率和效率，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Generalizable neural surface reconstruction has become a compelling technique
to reconstruct from few images without per-scene optimization, where dense 3D
feature volume has proven effective as a global representation of scenes.
However, the dense representation does not scale well to increasing voxel
resolutions, severely limiting the reconstruction quality. We thus present a
sparse representation method, that maximizes memory efficiency and enables
significantly higher resolution reconstructions on standard hardware. We
implement this through a two-stage approach: First training a network to
predict voxel occupancies from posed images and associated depth maps, then
computing features and performing volume rendering only in voxels with
sufficiently high occupancy estimates. To support this sparse representation,
we developed custom algorithms for efficient sampling, feature aggregation, and
querying from sparse volumes-overcoming the dense-volume assumptions inherent
in existing works. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach
reduces storage requirements by more than 50 times without performance
degradation, enabling reconstructions at $512^3$ resolution compared to the
typical $128^3$ on similar hardware, and achieving superior reconstruction
accuracy over current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformer models for motion-guided video
generation, such as Tora, have shown significant progress. In this paper, we
present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design
improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion
customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor
that generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set
entities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous
methods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to
integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each
entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal
conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that
jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit
mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best
knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization
of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate
that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization
methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a
critical advancement in multi-condition video generation. Project page:

Conclusion: T-LoRA为扩散模型个性化提供了高效解决方案，特别适合单图像定制任务。

Abstract: While diffusion model fine-tuning offers a powerful approach for customizing
pre-trained models to generate specific objects, it frequently suffers from
overfitting when training samples are limited, compromising both generalization
capability and output diversity. This paper tackles the challenging yet most
impactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image,
as single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We
introduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework
specifically designed for diffusion model personalization. In our work we show
that higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones,
necessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates
two key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts
rank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight
parametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components
through orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments show that T-LoRA and
its individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model
personalization techniques. They achieve a superior balance between concept
fidelity and text alignment, highlighting the potential of T-LoRA in
data-limited and resource-constrained scenarios. Code is available at

Conclusion: 证明了完全合成数据集训练CIR模型的可行性，并验证了CoAlign框架的有效性。

Abstract: As a challenging vision-language (VL) task, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR)
aims to retrieve target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. Although
many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance
on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot
capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic
triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image
Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a
large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a
text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements
in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS
dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a
novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning
within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and
informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign
achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks,
demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a
fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method
outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the
effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework. The code and the CIRHS
dataset will be released soon.

Conclusion: SCINet通过语义共现洞察和跨模态融合，有效解决了部分多标签学习中的模糊关系问题。

Abstract: Partial multi-label learning aims to extract knowledge from incompletely
annotated data, which includes known correct labels, known incorrect labels,
and unknown labels. The core challenge lies in accurately identifying the
ambiguous relationships between labels and instances. In this paper, we
emphasize that matching co-occurrence patterns between labels and instances is
key to addressing this challenge. To this end, we propose Semantic
Co-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for
partial multi-label learning. Specifically, SCINet introduces a bi-dominant
prompter module, which leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal model to capture
text-image correlations and enhance semantic alignment. To reinforce
instance-label interdependencies, we develop a cross-modality fusion module
that jointly models inter-label correlations, inter-instance relationships, and
co-occurrence patterns across instance-label assignments. Moreover, we propose
an intrinsic semantic augmentation strategy that enhances the model's
understanding of intrinsic data semantics by applying diverse image
transformations, thereby fostering a synergistic relationship between label
confidence and sample difficulty. Extensive experiments on four widely-used
benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCINet surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

two distinct out-of-domain datasets and demonstrate that no single model
consistently outperforms others across settings. In contrast, ensemble-based
predictions provide more stable and reliable performance in all scenarios. Our
results suggest that asymmetric ensembling offers a robust and scalable
solution for real-world deepfake detection where prior knowledge of forgery

Motivation: 在GNSS信号缺失的密集城区，现有依赖GNSS和IMU的方法因信号不稳定导致定位误差，亟需不依赖先验定位的解决方案。

Method: 使用预训练的点变换模型分割道路点，提取道路骨架和交叉点进行全局刚性对齐，再通过RBF插值局部优化，并结合SRTM数据进行高程校正。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了GNSS缺失区域的点云配准问题，显著提升了定位精度和高程一致性。

Abstract: Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds presents significant
challenges in GNSS signal denied urban areas with high-rise buildings and
bridges. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that
require pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection.
However, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in
localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration
and spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite
images, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of
city scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach
employs a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and
then extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as
well as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is
performed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using
radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied
to the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve
vertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新框架GCDA，通过改进扩散模型，解决了现有文本到图像生成模型中无法生成可读文本的问题，显著提升了文本渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型虽然能生成逼真多样的图像，但无法生成可读且拼写正确的文本，限制了其实际应用。

Method: GCDA框架通过双流文本编码器、字符感知注意力机制和OCR微调阶段，优化文本渲染能力。

Result: 实验表明GCDA在文本渲染（字符错误率0.08）、人类感知和图像合成质量（FID 14.3）上均达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: GCDA显著提升了文本到图像生成中文本的可读性和准确性，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The modern text-to-image diffusion models boom has opened a new era in
digital content production as it has proven the previously unseen ability to
produce photorealistic and stylistically diverse imagery based on the semantics
of natural-language descriptions. However, the consistent disadvantage of these
models is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled
text in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical
purposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces
a new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware
Attention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three
well-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder
that encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph
representations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input
text that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of
the character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to
limit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to
avoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning
phase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be
legible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets,
such as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new
state-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text
rendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error
Rate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality
on high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).

TL;DR: VisualSpeaker提出了一种基于光真实感可微分渲染的新方法，通过视觉语音识别监督，显著提升了3D面部动画的质量和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖网格域，无法充分利用2D计算机视觉和图形学的快速视觉创新，因此需要一种新方法来弥补这一差距。

Method: 使用光真实感可微分渲染，结合视觉语音识别监督，提出感知唇读损失函数，通过预训练的视觉自动语音识别模型优化3D高斯点云渲染的虚拟形象。

Result: 在MEAD数据集上评估，Lip Vertex Error指标提升了56.1%，同时保持了网格驱动动画的可控性。

Conclusion: VisualSpeaker在提升动画质量的同时，支持准确的嘴部动作，对消除手语虚拟形象中相似手势的歧义至关重要。

Abstract: Realistic, high-fidelity 3D facial animations are crucial for expressive
avatar systems in human-computer interaction and accessibility. Although prior
methods show promising quality, their reliance on the mesh domain limits their
ability to fully leverage the rapid visual innovations seen in 2D computer
vision and graphics. We propose VisualSpeaker, a novel method that bridges this
gap using photorealistic differentiable rendering, supervised by visual speech
recognition, for improved 3D facial animation. Our contribution is a perceptual
lip-reading loss, derived by passing photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting
avatar renders through a pre-trained Visual Automatic Speech Recognition model
during training. Evaluation on the MEAD dataset demonstrates that VisualSpeaker
improves both the standard Lip Vertex Error metric by 56.1% and the perceptual
quality of the generated animations, while retaining the controllability of
mesh-driven animation. This perceptual focus naturally supports accurate
mouthings, essential cues that disambiguate similar manual signs in sign
language avatars.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation aims to generate synchronized lip
movements and vivid facial expressions. However, most existing approaches focus
on static and predefined emotion labels, limiting their diversity and
naturalness. To address these challenges, we propose MEDTalk, a novel framework
for fine-grained and dynamic emotional talking head generation. Our approach
first disentangles content and emotion embedding spaces from motion sequences
using a carefully designed cross-reconstruction process, enabling independent
control over lip movements and facial expressions. Beyond conventional
audio-driven lip synchronization, we integrate audio and speech text,
predicting frame-wise intensity variations and dynamically adjusting static
emotion features to generate realistic emotional expressions. Furthermore, to
enhance control and personalization, we incorporate multimodal inputs-including
text descriptions and reference expression images-to guide the generation of
user-specified facial expressions. With MetaHuman as the priority, our
generated results can be conveniently integrated into the industrial production
pipeline.

Motivation: 现有方法在自动驾驶视频理解中往往只能挖掘浅层因果关系，无法处理跨模态的伪相关性，且忽略了自车层面的因果建模，因此需要一种更有效的模型。

Method: 设计了多级特征提取器捕捉长程依赖，因果分析模块动态建模驾驶场景（使用DAG），并利用视觉-语言Transformer对齐关键视觉特征与语言表达。

Result: 在BDD-X和CoVLA数据集上，MCAM在视觉-语言因果关系学习中实现了SOTA性能，并能有效捕捉视频序列中的因果特征。

Conclusion: MCAM在自动驾驶应用中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate driving behavior recognition and reasoning are critical for
autonomous driving video understanding. However, existing methods often tend to
dig out the shallow causal, fail to address spurious correlations across
modalities, and ignore the ego-vehicle level causality modeling. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Causal Analysis Model (MCAM)
that constructs latent causal structures between visual and language
modalities. Firstly, we design a multi-level feature extractor to capture
long-range dependencies. Secondly, we design a causal analysis module that
dynamically models driving scenarios using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of
driving states. Thirdly, we utilize a vision-language transformer to align
critical visual features with their corresponding linguistic expressions.
Extensive experiments on the BDD-X, and CoVLA datasets demonstrate that MCAM
achieves SOTA performance in visual-language causal relationship learning.
Furthermore, the model exhibits superior capability in capturing causal
characteristics within video sequences, showcasing its effectiveness for
autonomous driving applications. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了法线积分的准确性和适用性。

Abstract: Recovering a 3D surface from its surface normal map, a problem known as
normal integration, is a key component for photometric shape reconstruction
techniques such as shape-from-shading and photometric stereo. The vast majority
of existing approaches for normal integration handle only implicitly the
presence of depth discontinuities and are limited to orthographic or ideal
pinhole cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation that allows
modeling discontinuities explicitly and handling generic central cameras. Our
key idea is based on a local planarity assumption, that we model through
constraints between surface normals and ray directions. Compared to existing
methods, our approach more accurately approximates the relation between depth
and surface normals, achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard normal
integration benchmark, and is the first to directly handle generic central
camera models.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack
methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm
perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual
capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward
generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based
approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to
instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed
for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation
injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In
this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on
diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable
adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution
towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map
to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated
samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of
natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but
also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA
datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in
both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore,
the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables
ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感计算研究中，缺乏高质量的多模态数据集，且接触式设备可能干扰真实情绪反应，因此需要非接触式方法提取情感线索。

Result: 研究表明生理信号在真实场景中对情绪识别至关重要，多模态融合显著提升了非接触式情绪识别的效果。

Conclusion: CAST-Phys数据集为远程生理情绪识别提供了重要资源，推动了非接触式情感识别技术的发展。

Abstract: In recent years, affective computing and its applications have become a
fast-growing research topic. Despite significant advancements, the lack of
affective multi-modal datasets remains a major bottleneck in developing
accurate emotion recognition systems. Furthermore, the use of contact-based
devices during emotion elicitation often unintentionally influences the
emotional experience, reducing or altering the genuine spontaneous emotional
response. This limitation highlights the need for methods capable of extracting
affective cues from multiple modalities without physical contact, such as
remote physiological emotion recognition. To address this, we present the
Contactless Affective States Through Physiological Signals Database
(CAST-Phys), a novel high-quality dataset explicitly designed for multi-modal
remote physiological emotion recognition using facial and physiological cues.
The dataset includes diverse physiological signals, such as
photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiration rate
(RR), alongside high-resolution uncompressed facial video recordings, enabling
the potential for remote signal recovery. Our analysis highlights the crucial
role of physiological signals in realistic scenarios where facial expressions
alone may not provide sufficient emotional information. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the potential of remote multi-modal emotion recognition by
evaluating the impact of individual and fused modalities, showcasing its
effectiveness in advancing contactless emotion recognition technologies.

TL;DR: Ref-Unlock是一种基于3D高斯溅射的几何感知反射建模框架，通过显式分离透射和反射成分，提升复杂反射场景的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如NeRF和3DGS）在处理反射表面时，常将反射误认为物理几何，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 采用双分支表示和高阶球谐函数捕捉高频反射细节，结合反射移除模块和几何感知的双边平滑约束。

Result: 实验表明，Ref-Unlock显著优于传统GS方法，并与NeRF模型竞争，同时支持灵活的反射编辑。

Conclusion: Ref-Unlock为反射场景的逼真渲染提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately rendering scenes with reflective surfaces remains a significant
challenge in novel view synthesis, as existing methods like Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often misinterpret reflections
as physical geometry, resulting in degraded reconstructions. Previous methods
rely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to
misalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene
geometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the
accumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in
blurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose
Ref-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D
Gaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected
components to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric
consistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch
representation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency
reflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo
reflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we
incorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness
constraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms
classical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with
NeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs)
driven reflection editing. Our method thus offers an efficient and
generalizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes. Our code
is available at https://ref-unlock.github.io/.

Conclusion: Omni-Video为视频建模提供了一个高效统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Notable breakthroughs in unified understanding and generation modeling have
led to remarkable advancements in image understanding, reasoning, production
and editing, yet current foundational models predominantly focus on processing
images, creating a gap in the development of unified models for video
understanding and generation. This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and
effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as
instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used
as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos
conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system
for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a
lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on
the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the
former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens
to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage
training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion
decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically
demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities
across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models has underpinned much recent advances of dataset augmentation
in various computer vision tasks. However, when involving generating
multi-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely
entirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated
objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images,
resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited
help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose
a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image
augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion
strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge
into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation
between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a
reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss
for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead
of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the
generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the
generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and
showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization
capabilities. Code is available at

achieved a minimum loss (3.14e-8) and a validation accuracy (99.41%),

Conclusion: 该方法为不规则数据提供了类似Laplacian的平滑和处理能力，扩展了形状分析和匹配的应用。

Abstract: Smoothing a signal based on local neighborhoods is a core operation in
machine learning and geometry processing. On well-structured domains such as
vector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential
geometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with
strong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a
carefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most
practitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing
layers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain. We bridge this
gap by introducing a broad class of smoothing operators, derived from general
similarity or adjacency matrices, and demonstrate that they can be normalized
into diffusion-like operators that inherit desirable properties from
Laplacians. Our approach relies on a symmetric variant of the Sinkhorn
algorithm, which rescales positive smoothing operators to match the structural
behavior of heat diffusion. This construction enables Laplacian-like smoothing
and processing of irregular data such as point clouds, sparse voxel grids or
mixture of Gaussians. We show that the resulting operators not only approximate
heat diffusion but also retain spectral information from the Laplacian itself,
with applications to shape analysis and matching.

Abstract: The creation of 3D assets with explicit, editable part structures is crucial
for advancing interactive applications, yet most generative methods produce
only monolithic shapes, limiting their utility. We introduce OmniPart, a novel
framework for part-aware 3D object generation designed to achieve high semantic
decoupling among components while maintaining robust structural cohesion.
OmniPart uniquely decouples this complex task into two synergistic stages: (1)
an autoregressive structure planning module generates a controllable,
variable-length sequence of 3D part bounding boxes, critically guided by
flexible 2D part masks that allow for intuitive control over part decomposition
without requiring direct correspondences or semantic labels; and (2) a
spatially-conditioned rectified flow model, efficiently adapted from a
pre-trained holistic 3D generator, synthesizes all 3D parts simultaneously and
consistently within the planned layout. Our approach supports user-defined part
granularity, precise localization, and enables diverse downstream applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPart achieves state-of-the-art
performance, paving the way for more interpretable, editable, and versatile 3D
content.

Abstract: Technical reports and articles often contain valuable information in the form
of semi-structured data like charts, and figures. Interpreting these and using
the information from them is essential for downstream tasks such as question
answering (QA). Current approaches to visual question answering often struggle
with the precision required for scientific data interpretation, particularly in
handling numerical values, multi-step reasoning over visual elements, and
maintaining consistency between visual observation and textual reasoning. We
present our approach to the SciVQA 2025 shared task, focusing on answering
visual and non-visual questions grounded in scientific figures from scholarly
articles.
  We conducted a series of experiments using models with 5B to 8B parameters.
Our strongest individual model, InternVL3, achieved ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L F1
scores of \textbf{0.740} and a BERTScore of \textbf{0.983} on the SciVQA test
split. We also developed an ensemble model with multiple vision language models
(VLMs). Through error analysis on the validation split, our ensemble approach
improved performance compared to most individual models, though InternVL3
remained the strongest standalone performer. Our findings underscore the
effectiveness of prompt optimization, chain-of-thought reasoning and ensemble
modeling in improving the model's ability in visual question answering.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种方法，通过合成文化数据集CulTwin和定制对比学习，改进了预训练视觉语言模型CLIP在文化相关任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在多模态理解方面表现优异，但在区分视觉相似但文化背景不同的概念时存在困难。

Method: 设计了数据合成流程构建CulTwin数据集，并通过定制对比学习微调CLIP，创建CultureCLIP。

Result: CultureCLIP在文化相关任务中表现优于基础CLIP，某些任务中识别精度提高了5.49%。

Conclusion: 数据合成和模型微调方法有效捕捉了文化差异，同时保持了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in multimodal
understanding but struggle with contextually relevant fine-grained visual
features, making it difficult to distinguish visually similar yet culturally
distinct concepts. This limitation stems from the scarcity of high-quality
culture-specific datasets, the lack of integrated contextual knowledge, and the
absence of hard negatives highlighting subtle distinctions. To address these
challenges, we first design a data curation pipeline that leverages
open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models to construct CulTwin, a
synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired
concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but
represent different cultural contexts. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to
create CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced
captions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling
finer cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities.
Experiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms
the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained
concept recognition on certain tasks, while preserving CLIP's original
generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and
VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.

TL;DR: SceneDINO提出了一种无监督的语义场景补全方法，利用自监督学习和多视角一致性，无需标注数据即可推断3D几何和语义信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对昂贵标注数据的依赖，探索无监督学习在3D场景理解中的应用。

Method: 结合自监督表示学习和2D无监督场景理解技术，通过多视角一致性自监督训练，提出3D特征蒸馏方法。

Result: 在3D和2D无监督场景理解中达到最先进的分割精度，线性探测3D特征与当前监督方法相当。

Conclusion: SceneDINO为单图像3D场景理解提供了强大的基础，展示了领域泛化和多视角一致性。

Abstract: Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to infer both the 3D geometry and
semantics of a scene from single images. In contrast to prior work on SSC that
heavily relies on expensive ground-truth annotations, we approach SSC in an
unsupervised setting. Our novel method, SceneDINO, adapts techniques from
self-supervised representation learning and 2D unsupervised scene understanding
to SSC. Our training exclusively utilizes multi-view consistency
self-supervision without any form of semantic or geometric ground truth. Given
a single input image, SceneDINO infers the 3D geometry and expressive 3D DINO
features in a feed-forward manner. Through a novel 3D feature distillation
approach, we obtain unsupervised 3D semantics. In both 3D and 2D unsupervised
scene understanding, SceneDINO reaches state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.
Linear probing our 3D features matches the segmentation accuracy of a current
supervised SSC approach. Additionally, we showcase the domain generalization
and multi-view consistency of SceneDINO, taking the first steps towards a
strong foundation for single image 3D scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSRefSeg 2提出了一种解耦的双阶段框架，通过粗定位和精细分割改进遥感图像分割，结合CLIP和SAM的优势，提升了分割精度和语义解释能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理复杂语义关系和跨模态对齐时存在局限性，主要由于目标定位与边界划分的耦合处理机制导致错误传播和模型泛化性不足。

Method: 采用双阶段框架：粗定位（利用CLIP激活目标特征并生成定位提示）和精细分割（通过优化的语义提示指导SAM生成像素级掩码）。为解决多实体场景中的误激活问题，设计了级联二阶提示器。

Result: 在多个数据集上（RefSegRS、RRSIS-D、RISBench）表现优于现有方法，分割精度提升约3% gIoU。

Conclusion: RSRefSeg 2通过解耦设计和基础模型协作，显著提升了遥感图像分割的精度和语义解释能力。

Abstract: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation provides a flexible and
fine-grained framework for remote sensing scene analysis via vision-language
collaborative interpretation. Current approaches predominantly utilize a
three-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction,
and pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in
managing complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal
alignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates
target localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling
amplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model
generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose
RSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow
into a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine
segmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with
SAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model
collaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to
activate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate
localization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in
multi-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order
prompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via
decomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These
optimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level
refined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive
experiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2
surpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex
semantic interpretation. Code is available at:

TL;DR: AnthroTAP提出了一种自动化生成伪标记训练数据的流程，利用SMPL模型解决点跟踪任务中数据标注困难的问题，并在TAP-Vid基准测试中取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类运动数据标注困难，但适合训练鲁棒的点跟踪器。

Method: 使用SMPL模型拟合视频中的人体，生成伪轨迹，处理遮挡并过滤不可靠轨迹。

Result: 在TAP-Vid基准测试中表现最佳，数据量和计算资源需求大幅减少。

Conclusion: AnthroTAP提供了一种高效的点跟踪数据生成方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Human motion, with its inherent complexities, such as non-rigid deformations,
articulated movements, clothing distortions, and frequent occlusions caused by
limbs or other individuals, provides a rich and challenging source of
supervision that is crucial for training robust and generalizable point
trackers. Despite the suitability of human motion, acquiring extensive training
data for point tracking remains difficult due to laborious manual annotation.
Our proposed pipeline, AnthroTAP, addresses this by proposing an automated
pipeline to generate pseudo-labeled training data, leveraging the Skinned
Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model. We first fit the SMPL model to detected
humans in video frames, project the resulting 3D mesh vertices onto 2D image
planes to generate pseudo-trajectories, handle occlusions using ray-casting,
and filter out unreliable tracks based on optical flow consistency. A point
tracking model trained on AnthroTAP annotated dataset achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the TAP-Vid benchmark, surpassing other models trained on real
videos while using 10,000 times less data and only 1 day in 4 GPUs, compared to
256 GPUs used in recent state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有FGNN方法未能利用隐式用户交互，影响预测准确性。

Method: 提出HC-FGNN，通过注意力机制扩展显式用户-服务图以捕捉隐式交互，并采用轻量级消息聚合提高效率。

Result: 在两个真实QoS数据集上实验表明，HC-FGNN预测准确且保护隐私。

Conclusion: HC-FGNN在QoS预测和隐私保护方面表现优异。

Abstract: Predicting Quality of Service (QoS) data crucial for cloud service selection,
where user privacy is a critical concern. Federated Graph Neural Networks
(FGNNs) can perform QoS data prediction as well as maintaining user privacy.
However, existing FGNN-based QoS predictors commonly implement on-device
training on scattered explicit user-service graphs, thereby failing to utilize
the implicit user-user interactions. To address this issue, this study proposes
a high order collaboration-oriented federated graph neural network (HC-FGNN) to
obtain accurate QoS prediction with privacy preservation. Concretely, it
magnifies the explicit user-service graphs following the principle of attention
mechanism to obtain the high order collaboration, which reflects the implicit
user-user interactions. Moreover, it utilizes a lightweight-based message
aggregation way to improve the computational efficiency. The extensive
experiments on two QoS datasets from real application indicate that the
proposed HC-FGNN possesses the advantages of high prediction accurate and
privacy protection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于AirComp的分组异步联邦学习机制（Air-FedGA），结合AirComp和异步FL的优势，解决通信和异构性挑战，实验显示训练速度提升29.9%-71.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在分布式边缘设备上训练AI模型时面临通信资源限制、设备异构性和数据非独立同分布（Non-IID）等挑战。AirComp技术虽能高效利用通信资源，但对设备同步要求严格。

Method: 提出Air-FedGA机制，将设备分组并在组内进行AirComp聚合，组间异步与参数服务器通信更新全局模型，同时优化功率控制和分组策略。

Result: 理论证明Air-FedGA的收敛性，实验结果显示其训练速度比现有方案快29.9%-71.6%。

Conclusion: Air-FedGA有效解决了FL中的通信和异构性问题，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a new paradigm to train AI models over distributed
edge devices (i.e., workers) using their local data, while confronting various
challenges including communication resource constraints, edge heterogeneity and
data Non-IID. Over-the-air computation (AirComp) is a promising technique to
achieve efficient utilization of communication resource for model aggregation
by leveraging the superposition property of a wireless multiple access channel
(MAC). However, AirComp requires strict synchronization among edge devices,
which is hard to achieve in heterogeneous scenarios. In this paper, we propose
an AirComp-based grouping asynchronous federated learning mechanism
(Air-FedGA), which combines the advantages of AirComp and asynchronous FL to
address the communication and heterogeneity challenges. Specifically, Air-FedGA
organizes workers into groups and performs over-the-air aggregation within each
group, while groups asynchronously communicate with the parameter server to
update the global model. In this way, Air-FedGA accelerates the FL model
training by over-the-air aggregation, while relaxing the synchronization
requirement of this aggregation technology. We theoretically prove the
convergence of Air-FedGA. We formulate a training time minimization problem for
Air-FedGA and propose the power control and worker grouping algorithm to solve
it, which jointly optimizes the power scaling factors at edge devices, the
denoising factors at the parameter server, as well as the worker grouping
strategy. We conduct experiments on classical models and datasets, and the
results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism and algorithm can speed up FL
model training by 29.9%-71.6% compared with the state-of-the-art solutions.

Conclusion: ECORE有效平衡边缘计算中的能耗与性能，适用于实时视觉分析。

Abstract: Edge computing enables data processing closer to the source, significantly
reducing latency an essential requirement for real-time vision-based analytics
such as object detection in surveillance and smart city environments. However,
these tasks place substantial demands on resource constrained edge devices,
making the joint optimization of energy consumption and detection accuracy
critical. To address this challenge, we propose ECORE, a framework that
integrates multiple dynamic routing strategies including estimation based
techniques and a greedy selection algorithm to direct image processing requests
to the most suitable edge device-model pair. ECORE dynamically balances energy
efficiency and detection performance based on object characteristics. We
evaluate our approach through extensive experiments on real-world datasets,
comparing the proposed routers against widely used baseline techniques. The
evaluation leverages established object detection models (YOLO, SSD,
EfficientDet) and diverse edge platforms, including Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry
Pi 4 and 5, and TPU accelerators. Results demonstrate that our proposed
context-aware routing strategies can reduce energy consumption and latency by
45% and 49%, respectively, while incurring only a 2% loss in detection accuracy
compared to accuracy-centric methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a compelling methodology for the
management of distributed data, marked by significant advancements in recent
years. In this paper, we propose an efficient FL approach that capitalizes on
additional downlink bandwidth resources to ensure timely update dissemination.
Initially, we implement this strategy within an asynchronous framework,
introducing the Asynchronous Staleness-aware Model Update (FedASMU), which
integrates both server-side and device-side methodologies. On the server side,
we present an asynchronous FL system model that employs a dynamic model
aggregation technique, which harmonizes local model updates with the global
model to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. Concurrently, on the device
side, we propose an adaptive model adjustment mechanism that integrates the
latest global model with local models during training to further elevate
accuracy. Subsequently, we extend this approach to a synchronous context,
referred to as FedSSMU. Theoretical analyses substantiate the convergence of
our proposed methodologies. Extensive experiments, encompassing six models and
five public datasets, demonstrate that FedASMU and FedSSMU significantly
surpass baseline methods in terms of both accuracy (up to 145.87%) and
efficiency (up to 97.59%).

Method: 设计统一本体，基于M100和F-DATA数据集建模，通过36个能力问题验证，并优化存储开销。

Result: 存储开销减少38.84%，部署配置下额外减少26.82%，支持跨系统分析。

Conclusion: 该本体为可扩展的ODA知识图谱奠定基础，支持异构HPC系统的跨系统分析。

Abstract: Modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems generate massive volumes of
heterogeneous telemetry data from millions of sensors monitoring compute,
memory, power, cooling, and storage subsystems. As HPC infrastructures scale to
support increasingly complex workloads-including generative AI-the need for
efficient, reliable, and interoperable telemetry analysis becomes critical.
Operational Data Analytics (ODA) has emerged to address these demands; however,
the reliance on schema-less storage solutions limits data accessibility and
semantic integration. Ontologies and knowledge graphs (KG) provide an effective
way to enable efficient and expressive data querying by capturing domain
semantics, but they face challenges such as significant storage overhead and
the limited applicability of existing ontologies, which are often tailored to
specific HPC systems only. In this paper, we present the first unified ontology
for ODA in HPC systems, designed to enable semantic interoperability across
heterogeneous data centers. Our ontology models telemetry data from the two
largest publicly available ODA datasets-M100 (Cineca, Italy) and F-DATA
(Fugaku, Japan)-within a single data model. The ontology is validated through
36 competency questions reflecting real-world stakeholder requirements, and we
introduce modeling optimizations that reduce knowledge graph (KG) storage
overhead by up to 38.84% compared to a previous approach, with an additional
26.82% reduction depending on the desired deployment configuration. This work
paves the way for scalable ODA KGs and supports not only analysis within
individual systems, but also cross-system analysis across heterogeneous HPC
systems.

Conclusion: PRAC的实际性能开销较低，且通过关闭页面策略可进一步减少开销。

Abstract: Per-Row Activation Counting (PRAC), a DRAM read disturbance mitigation
method, modifies key DRAM timing parameters, reportedly causing significant
performance overheads in simulator-based studies. However, given known
discrepancies between simulators and real hardware, real-machine experiments
are vital for accurate PRAC performance estimation. We present the first
real-machine performance analysis of PRAC. After verifying timing modifications
on the latest CPUs using microbenchmarks, our analysis shows that PRAC's
average and maximum overheads are just 1.06% and 3.28% for the SPEC CPU2017
workloads -- up to 9.15x lower than simulator-based reports. Further, we show
that the close page policy minimizes this overhead by effectively hiding the
elongated DRAM row precharge operations due to PRAC from the critical path.

Abstract: Prefix adders are fundamental arithmetic circuits, but their design space
grows exponentially with bit-width, posing significant optimization challenges.
Previous works face limitations in performance, generalization, and
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose PrefixAgent, a large
language model (LLM)-powered framework that enables efficient prefix adder
optimization. Specifically, PrefixAgent reformulates the problem into subtasks
including backbone synthesis and structure refinement, which effectively
reduces the search space. More importantly, this new design perspective enables
us to efficiently collect enormous high-quality data and reasoning traces with
E-graph, which further results in an effective fine-tuning of LLM. Experimental
results show that PrefixAgent synthesizes prefix adders with consistently
smaller areas compared to baseline methods, while maintaining scalability and

Abstract: Spatiotemporal data are being produced in continuously growing volumes by a

characteristics. As a consequence, big spatiotemporal data scenarios still have
limited support even though many query types can easily be parallelized. In
this paper, we propose our vision of a native serverless data processing
approach for spatiotemporal data: We break down queries into small subqueries
which then leverage the near-instant scaling of Function-as-a-Service platforms
to execute them in parallel. With this, we partially solve the scalability
needs of big spatiotemporal data processing.

(LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i)
eliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while
providing the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to
constrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of
queries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and
execution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift
and Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost
distributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber
introduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate
customized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a
self-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based
on query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different
predicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost
distribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty
levels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from
Snowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show
that SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates.
It reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and
significantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared
with existing methods.

### [151] [Chat2SPaT: A Large Language Model Based Tool for Automating Traffic Signal Control Plan Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05283)
*Yue Wang,Miao Zhou,Guijing Huang,Rui Zhuo,Chao Yi,Zhenliang Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chat2SPaT利用大型语言模型（LLM）将用户对交通信号控制计划的半结构化描述转换为精确的信号相位与时间（SPaT）结果，准确率超过94%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统定时交通信号控制需要繁琐的手动操作，且一个交叉口常关联多个计划，导致重复输入。Chat2SPaT旨在简化这一过程。

Method: 通过LLM理解用户描述并生成JSON格式的相位序列和属性，再用Python脚本处理细节并组装完整计划。

Result: 实验显示，Chat2SPaT在300多个测试案例中准确率超过94%。

Conclusion: Chat2SPaT为交通从业者提供了易用的计划管理工具，并为LLM在智能交通系统中的应用提供了新范例。

Abstract: Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized
intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for
signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans
are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading
to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a
user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study
proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous
descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)
results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or
ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)
software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first
leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan
descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and
phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python
scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic
signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.
Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan
editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of
over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300
plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of
understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an
easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,
serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile
application of LLMs in the field of ITS. The source codes, prompts and test
dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/yuewangits/Chat2SPaT.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在AR训练中的应用，填补研究空白，并为视障用户提供平等的AI学习机会。

Method: 构建了系统化的视觉语言任务数据集，并评估了九种先进VLM模型的表现。

Result: 即使是GPT-4o等先进模型在细粒度任务（如状态检测）上表现不佳，最高F1分数仅为40.54%。

Conclusion: 需改进数据集和基准测试以提升视觉语言对齐能力，研究对AR训练和视障用户有重要社会意义。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for enabling AI-powered smart
assistants to interpret and reason in multimodal environments. However, their
application in augmented reality (AR) training remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we introduce a comprehensive dataset tailored for AR training,
featuring systematized vision-language tasks, and evaluate nine
state-of-the-art VLMs on it. Our results reveal that even advanced models,
including GPT-4o, struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, achieving a
maximum F1 score of just 40.54% on state detection. These findings highlight
the demand for enhanced datasets, benchmarks, and further research to improve
fine-grained vision-language alignment. Beyond technical contributions, our
work has broader social implications, particularly in empowering blind and
visually impaired users with equitable access to AI-driven learning
opportunities. We provide all related resources, including the dataset, source
code, and evaluation results, to support the research community.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在预测早产儿视网膜病变（ROP）风险中的能力，提出了CROP数据集和Affective-ROPTester评估框架，发现外部知识增强和情感提示对模型性能有显著影响。


<details>

Motivation: 探索LLM在ROP风险预测中的潜力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用CROP数据集（993条记录），提出Affective-ROPTester框架，结合指令、思维链和上下文学习三种提示策略，并引入情感元素。

Result: LLM仅依赖内部知识时效果有限，但结合外部知识后性能提升；情感偏见明显，积极情感提示能减少偏见。

Conclusion: 情感敏感的提示工程对提升诊断可靠性至关重要，Affective-ROPTester是评估和减轻临床语言模型中情感偏见的有效工具。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across
various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)
risk remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel
Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records
annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the
predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk
stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation
framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme
assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and
ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.
Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate
how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP
and its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield
two principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP
risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit
marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.
Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent
inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared
to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating
predictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of
affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and
emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and
mitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems.

Motivation: 现有音乐描述模型仅关注音乐元素，缺乏对场景的想象能力。本文旨在通过跨模态训练提升模型在音乐场景想象（MSI）任务中的表现。

Method: 1. 构建包含3,371对视频-音频描述的大规模数据集；2. 微调Music Understanding LLaMA以创建MusiScene模型；3. 进行综合评估。

Result: MusiScene在生成上下文相关描述方面优于MU-LLaMA，并利用MSI描述提升了文本驱动的视频背景音乐生成（VBMG）。

Conclusion: MusiScene通过跨模态训练有效提升了音乐场景想象能力，为音乐与视频的结合应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans can imagine various atmospheres and settings when listening to music,
envisioning movie scenes that complement each piece. For example, slow,
melancholic music might evoke scenes of heartbreak, while upbeat melodies
suggest celebration. This paper explores whether a Music Language Model, e.g.
MU-LLaMA, can perform a similar task, called Music Scene Imagination (MSI),
which requires cross-modal information from video and music to train. To
improve upon existing music captioning models which focusing solely on musical
elements, we introduce MusiScene, a music captioning model designed to imagine
scenes that complement each music. In this paper, (1) we construct a
large-scale video-audio caption dataset with 3,371 pairs, (2) we finetune Music
Understanding LLaMA for the MSI task to create MusiScene, and (3) we conduct
comprehensive evaluations and prove that our MusiScene is more capable of
generating contextually relevant captions compared to MU-LLaMA. We leverage the
generated MSI captions to enhance Video Background Music Generation (VBMG) from
text.

Motivation: 传统PHQ-9问卷缺乏互动性和适应性，HopeBot旨在通过聊天机器人提供更清晰的结构、解释性指导和支持性语气。

Method: 开发了HopeBot，采用检索增强生成和实时澄清技术，并在英国和中国的132名成年人中进行自填和聊天机器人版本的对比研究。

Result: HopeBot与自填问卷得分高度一致（ICC=0.91），71%用户更信任聊天机器人，87.1%愿意重复使用或推荐。

Conclusion: 语音驱动的LLM聊天机器人可作为抑郁症筛查的可扩展、低负担辅助工具。

Abstract: Static tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) effectively
screen depression but lack interactivity and adaptability. We developed
HopeBot, a chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM) that administers the
PHQ-9 using retrieval-augmented generation and real-time clarification. In a
within-subject study, 132 adults in the United Kingdom and China completed both
self-administered and chatbot versions. Scores demonstrated strong agreement
(ICC = 0.91; 45% identical). Among 75 participants providing comparative
feedback, 71% reported greater trust in the chatbot, highlighting clearer
structure, interpretive guidance, and a supportive tone. Mean ratings (0-10)
were 8.4 for comfort, 7.7 for voice clarity, 7.6 for handling sensitive topics,
and 7.4 for recommendation helpfulness; the latter varied significantly by
employment status and prior mental-health service use (p < 0.05). Overall,
87.1% expressed willingness to reuse or recommend HopeBot. These findings
demonstrate voice-based LLM chatbots can feasibly serve as scalable, low-burden
adjuncts for routine depression screening.

Motivation: 解决在遮挡、杂乱的真实场景中，现有方法无法泛化的部分视图3D识别问题。

Method: 结合粗粒度3D重建、对比学习的实例分割和文本引导的实例级细化。

Result: 实验表明DreamGrasp能准确恢复物体几何，并支持下游任务如顺序清理和目标检索。

Conclusion: DreamGrasp在复杂多对象环境中表现出色，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Partial-view 3D recognition -- reconstructing 3D geometry and identifying
object instances from a few sparse RGB images -- is an exceptionally
challenging yet practically essential task, particularly in cluttered, occluded
real-world settings where full-view or reliable depth data are often
unavailable. Existing methods, whether based on strong symmetry priors or
supervised learning on curated datasets, fail to generalize to such scenarios.
In this work, we introduce DreamGrasp, a framework that leverages the
imagination capability of large-scale pre-trained image generative models to
infer the unobserved parts of a scene. By combining coarse 3D reconstruction,
instance segmentation via contrastive learning, and text-guided instance-wise
refinement, DreamGrasp circumvents limitations of prior methods and enables
robust 3D reconstruction in complex, multi-object environments. Our experiments
show that DreamGrasp not only recovers accurate object geometry but also
supports downstream tasks like sequential decluttering and target retrieval
with high success rates.

Motivation: 解决复杂城市环境中GNSS定位不可靠及传统地图方法存储和计算效率低的问题。

Method: 结合多传感器数据构建高精度3DGS地图，利用SuperPoint和SuperGlue进行特征提取与匹配，采用迭代优化策略逐步优化定位结果。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，平均定位精度分别为0.026m（城镇道路）、0.029m（林荫道）和0.081m（交通密集高速公路），显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 3DGS-LSR为自主机器人在GNSS失效的复杂环境中提供了可靠的定位能力。

Abstract: In autonomous robotic systems, precise localization is a prerequisite for
safe navigation. However, in complex urban environments, GNSS positioning often
suffers from signal occlusion and multipath effects, leading to unreliable
absolute positioning. Traditional mapping approaches are constrained by storage
requirements and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability to
resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address these challenges, we propose
3DGS-LSR: a large-scale relocalization framework leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling centimeter-level positioning using only a single
monocular RGB image on the client side. We combine multi-sensor data to
construct high-accuracy 3DGS maps in large outdoor scenes, while the robot-side
localization requires just a standard camera input. Using SuperPoint and
SuperGlue for feature extraction and matching, our core innovation is an
iterative optimization strategy that refines localization results through
step-by-step rendering, making it suitable for real-time autonomous navigation.
Experimental validation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates our 3DGS-LSR achieves
average positioning accuracies of 0.026m, 0.029m, and 0.081m in town roads,
boulevard roads, and traffic-dense highways respectively, significantly
outperforming other representative methods while requiring only monocular RGB
input. This approach provides autonomous robots with reliable localization
capabilities even in challenging urban environments where GNSS fails.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于先验信息嵌入和小波特征融合的快速采样扩散模型（PWD），用于有限角度CT重建，显著减少了采样步骤并保持了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准扩散模型在有限角度CT重建中需要大量采样步骤，计算开销大；现有跳过采样策略虽提高效率但损失细节。

Method: PWD在训练阶段学习LACT图像与目标图像的分布映射，推理阶段利用LACT图像作为先验指导采样，并结合小波域多尺度特征融合增强细节。

Result: 在临床数据集上，PWD仅需50步采样，PSNR提升至少1.7 dB，SSIM提升10%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PWD通过先验信息嵌入和小波特征融合，实现了高效且高质量的有限角度CT重建。

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have received increasing attention in medical
imaging, particularly in limited-angle computed tomography (LACT). Standard
diffusion models achieve high-quality image reconstruction but require a large
number of sampling steps during inference, resulting in substantial
computational overhead. Although skip-sampling strategies have been proposed to
improve efficiency, they often lead to loss of fine structural details. To
address this issue, we propose a prior information embedding and wavelet
feature fusion fast sampling diffusion model for LACT reconstruction. The PWD
enables efficient sampling while preserving reconstruction fidelity in LACT,
and effectively mitigates the degradation typically introduced by
skip-sampling. Specifically, during the training phase, PWD maps the
distribution of LACT images to that of fully sampled target images, enabling
the model to learn structural correspondences between them. During inference,
the LACT image serves as an explicit prior to guide the sampling trajectory,
allowing for high-quality reconstruction with significantly fewer steps. In
addition, PWD performs multi-scale feature fusion in the wavelet domain,
effectively enhancing the reconstruction of fine details by leveraging both
low-frequency and high-frequency information. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations on clinical dental arch CBCT and periapical datasets demonstrate
that PWD outperforms existing methods under the same sampling condition. Using
only 50 sampling steps, PWD achieves at least 1.7 dB improvement in PSNR and
10% gain in SSIM.

Motivation: UMI在无对比剂或深部组织场景中常因低SNR影响血管定量和疾病诊断，需一种有效去噪方法。

Method: HA2HA利用互补角度的射频血流数据构建训练对，血管信号一致而噪声变化，实现自监督去噪。

Result: 在多种数据集上验证，SNR和CNR提升超过15 dB，显著改善图像质量，并提升下游处理如彩色多普勒成像（CDI）的效果。

Conclusion: HA2HA是一种无需标记、通用且临床适用的解决方案，适用于无对比剂和增强UMI中的稳健血管成像。

Abstract: Ultrasound microvascular imaging (UMI) is often hindered by low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), especially in contrast-free or deep tissue
scenarios, which impairs subsequent vascular quantification and reliable
disease diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose
Half-Angle-to-Half-Angle (HA2HA), a self-supervised denoising framework
specifically designed for UMI. HA2HA constructs training pairs from
complementary angular subsets of beamformed radio-frequency (RF) blood flow
data, across which vascular signals remain consistent while noise varies. HA2HA
was trained using in-vivo contrast-free pig kidney data and validated across
diverse datasets, including contrast-free and contrast-enhanced data from pig
kidneys, as well as human liver and kidney. An improvement exceeding 15 dB in
both contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and SNR was observed, indicating a
substantial enhancement in image quality. In addition to power Doppler imaging,
denoising directly in the RF domain is also beneficial for other downstream
processing such as color Doppler imaging (CDI). CDI results of human liver
derived from the HA2HA-denoised signals exhibited improved microvascular flow
visualization, with a suppressed noisy background. HA2HA offers a label-free,
generalizable, and clinically applicable solution for robust vascular imaging
in both contrast-free and contrast-enhanced UMI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肿瘤分割在CT扫描中至关重要，但分割掩码稀缺且制作耗时。利用大量现成的放射学报告补充稀缺的分割掩码，是提升分割模型性能的关键。

Method: 提出了一种报告监督损失（R-Super），将放射学报告转化为体素级监督信号，结合公开数据集（AbdomenAtlas 2.0）和自建数据集（6,718对CT-报告）训练模型。

Result: 在内部和外部验证中，R-Super显著提高了肿瘤分割性能，F1分数最高提升16%。在少量（如50）或大量（如1.7K）掩码情况下均有效。

Conclusion: R-Super通过利用现成的放射学报告，显著提升了肿瘤分割AI的性能，为稀缺掩码情况下的模型训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Tumor segmentation in CT scans is key for diagnosis, surgery, and prognosis,
yet segmentation masks are scarce because their creation requires time and
expertise. Public abdominal CT datasets have from dozens to a couple thousand
tumor masks, but hospitals have hundreds of thousands of tumor CTs with
radiology reports. Thus, leveraging reports to improve segmentation is key for
scaling. In this paper, we propose a report-supervision loss (R-Super) that
converts radiology reports into voxel-wise supervision for tumor segmentation
AI. We created a dataset with 6,718 CT-Report pairs (from the UCSF Hospital),
and merged it with public CT-Mask datasets (from AbdomenAtlas 2.0). We used our
R-Super to train with these masks and reports, and strongly improved tumor
segmentation in internal and external validation--F1 Score increased by up to
16% with respect to training with masks only. By leveraging readily available
radiology reports to supplement scarce segmentation masks, R-Super strongly
improves AI performance both when very few training masks are available (e.g.,
50), and when many masks were available (e.g., 1.7K).

### [165] [Diffusion-Based Limited-Angle CT Reconstruction under Noisy Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05647)
*Jiaqi Guo,Santiago López-Tapia*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的框架，通过MR-SDE公式完成缺失的角投影，并引入RNSD$^+$机制处理噪声，提升了有限角度CT重建的鲁棒性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限角度CT（LACT）因缺失角投影导致重建图像存在严重伪影，现有方法多假设理想无噪声测量，未考虑实际噪声影响。

Method: 将LACT视为正弦图修复任务，采用扩散模型和MR-SDE公式补全缺失角投影，并提出噪声感知的RNSD$^+$机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在数据一致性和感知质量上优于基线模型，且对不同噪声强度和采集场景具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 所提框架有效解决了LACT中的噪声问题，实现了可靠且鲁棒的重建。

Abstract: Limited-Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) is a challenging inverse problem
where missing angular projections lead to incomplete sinograms and severe
artifacts in the reconstructed images. While recent learning-based methods have
demonstrated effectiveness, most of them assume ideal, noise-free measurements
and fail to address the impact of measurement noise. To overcome this
limitation, we treat LACT as a sinogram inpainting task and propose a
diffusion-based framework that completes missing angular views using a
Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equation (MR-SDE) formulation. To
improve robustness under realistic noise, we propose RNSD$^+$, a novel
noise-aware rectification mechanism that explicitly models inference-time
uncertainty, enabling reliable and robust reconstruction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses baseline models in data
consistency and perceptual quality, and generalizes well across varying noise
intensity and acquisition scenarios.

TL;DR: ADPv2是一个专注于胃肠道组织病理学的新数据集，包含20,004个图像块，标注了32种不同的组织类型。通过VMamba架构训练的多标签分类模型达到了0.88的mAP，并揭示了结肠癌发展的两种病理途径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集如ADP虽然提供了多样化的组织类型标注，但缺乏针对特定器官疾病的深入研究能力。ADPv2旨在填补这一空白，专注于胃肠道组织病理学。

Method: 使用ADPv2数据集，采用两阶段训练流程训练了一个多标签表示学习模型，基于VMamba架构。

Result: 模型在结肠组织类型的多标签分类中达到了0.88的mAP，并揭示了结肠癌发展的两种病理途径。

Conclusion: ADPv2数据集支持针对特定器官的深入研究，为潜在的生物标志物发现提供了基础，并公开了数据集供研究使用。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CoPath) leverages histopathology images to enhance
diagnostic precision and reproducibility in clinical pathology. However,
publicly available datasets for CoPath that are annotated with extensive
histological tissue type (HTT) taxonomies at a granular level remain scarce due
to the significant expertise and high annotation costs required. Existing
datasets, such as the Atlas of Digital Pathology (ADP), address this by
offering diverse HTT annotations generalized to multiple organs, but limit the
capability for in-depth studies on specific organ diseases. Building upon this
foundation, we introduce ADPv2, a novel dataset focused on gastrointestinal
histopathology. Our dataset comprises 20,004 image patches derived from healthy
colon biopsy slides, annotated according to a hierarchical taxonomy of 32
distinct HTTs of 3 levels. Furthermore, we train a multilabel representation
learning model following a two-stage training procedure on our ADPv2 dataset.
We leverage the VMamba architecture and achieving a mean average precision
(mAP) of 0.88 in multilabel classification of colon HTTs. Finally, we show that
our dataset is capable of an organ-specific in-depth study for potential
biomarker discovery by analyzing the model's prediction behavior on tissues
affected by different colon diseases, which reveals statistical patterns that
confirm the two pathological pathways of colon cancer development. Our dataset
is publicly available here: Part 1 at https://zenodo.org/records/15307021, Part

Conclusion: TCv2为计算病理学提供了一种高效、可解释的基础模型解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are transforming the field of computational pathology
by offering new approaches to analyzing histopathology images. Typically
relying on weeks of training on large databases, the creation of FMs is a
resource-intensive process in many ways. In this paper, we introduce the
extension of our supervised foundation model, Tissue Concepts, to whole slide
images, called Tissue Concepts v2 (TCv2), a supervised foundation model for
whole slide images to address the issue above. TCv2 uses supervised, end-to-end
multitask learning on slide-level labels. Training TCv2 uses a fraction of the
training resources compared to self-supervised training. The presented model
shows superior performance compared to SSL-trained models in cancer subtyping
benchmarks and is fully trained on freely available data. Furthermore, a shared
trained attention module provides an additional layer of explainability across
different tasks.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于深度学习的框架，用于自动纵向和圆周配准IVUS和OCT图像，结果与专家分析相当。


<details>

Motivation: 实现IVUS和OCT图像的完全自动化配准，以提高大规模多模态成像研究的效率。

Method: 使用61,655 NIRS-IVUS和62,334 OCT帧训练深度学习模型，结合动态时间规整和动态编程算法进行配准。

Result: 在测试集上，纵向和圆周配准的相关系数分别>0.99和>0.90，处理时间<90秒。

Conclusion: 该自动化框架快速且准确，适用于大规模多模态成像研究。

Abstract: Aims: To develop a deep-learning (DL) framework that will allow fully
automated longitudinal and circumferential co-registration of intravascular
ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Methods and
results: Data from 230 patients (714 vessels) with acute coronary syndrome that
underwent near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-IVUS and OCT imaging in their
non-culprit vessels were included in the present analysis. The lumen borders
annotated by expert analysts in 61,655 NIRS-IVUS and 62,334 OCT frames, and the
side branches and calcific tissue identified in 10,000 NIRS-IVUS frames and
10,000 OCT frames, were used to train DL solutions for the automated extraction
of these features. The trained DL solutions were used to process NIRS-IVUS and
OCT images and their output was used by a dynamic time warping algorithm to
co-register longitudinally the NIRS-IVUS and OCT images, while the
circumferential registration of the IVUS and OCT was optimized through dynamic
programming. On a test set of 77 vessels from 22 patients, the DL method showed
high concordance with the expert analysts for the longitudinal and
circumferential co-registration of the two imaging sets (concordance
correlation coefficient >0.99 for the longitudinal and >0.90 for the
circumferential co-registration). The Williams Index was 0.96 for longitudinal
and 0.97 for circumferential co-registration, indicating a comparable
performance to the analysts. The time needed for the DL pipeline to process
imaging data from a vessel was <90s. Conclusion: The fully automated, DL-based
framework introduced in this study for the co-registration of IVUS and OCT is
fast and provides estimations that compare favorably to the expert analysts.
These features renders it useful in research in the analysis of large-scale
data collected in studies that incorporate multimodality imaging to
characterize plaque composition.

TL;DR: 通过多模态学习结合术中CBCT和术前CT数据，提出一种端到端可学习的配准模块，提升合成CT（sCT）生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT图像存在伪影和视觉质量较低的问题，而合成CT（sCT）生成是一种潜在解决方案。多模态学习可以结合CBCT和CT数据，但模态间存在不对齐问题。

Method: 在sCT生成流程中引入端到端可学习的配准模块，解决CBCT和CT数据的不对齐问题。在合成数据集和真实临床数据集上验证模型。

Result: 实验表明，整合配准模块的多模态sCT生成方法在79/90的评估场景中优于基线方法，尤其在CBCT质量低且CT中度不对齐时效果显著。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了sCT生成质量，尤其在复杂场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for intraoperative
imaging due to its rapid acquisition and low radiation dose. However, CBCT
images typically suffer from artifacts and lower visual quality compared to
conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A promising solution is synthetic CT
(sCT) generation, where CBCT volumes are translated into the CT domain. In this
work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning by jointly
leveraging intraoperative CBCT and preoperative CT data. To overcome the
inherent misalignment between modalities, we introduce an end-to-end learnable
registration module within the sCT pipeline. This model is evaluated on a
controlled synthetic dataset, allowing precise manipulation of data quality and
alignment parameters. Further, we validate its robustness and generalizability
on two real-world clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
integrating registration in multimodal sCT generation improves sCT quality,
outperforming baseline multimodal methods in 79 out of 90 evaluation settings.
Notably, the improvement is most significant in cases where CBCT quality is low
and the preoperative CT is moderately misaligned.

*Zhihao Chen,Tao Chen,Chenhui Wang,Qi Gao,Huidong Xie,Chuang Niu,Ge Wang,Hongming Shan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: LangMamba是一个基于语言驱动的Mamba框架，用于低剂量CT（LDCT）去噪，通过结合视觉语言模型（VLM）的语义信息提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）虽然减少辐射，但图像质量下降可能影响诊断准确性。现有深度学习方法忽略高层次语义指导的潜力。

Method: 采用两阶段学习策略：1）预训练语言引导自编码器（LangAE），将正常剂量CT（NDCT）映射到语义空间；2）结合SEED模块和LangDA损失，指导LDCT去噪。

Result: 在公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，显著提升细节保留和视觉保真度，且LangAE具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 语言作为监督信号在LDCT去噪中具有潜力，LangMamba为图像重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but often
degrades image quality, potentially compromising diagnostic accuracy. Existing
deep learning-based denoising methods focus primarily on pixel-level mappings,
overlooking the potential benefits of high-level semantic guidance. Recent
advances in vision-language models (VLMs) suggest that language can serve as a
powerful tool for capturing structured semantic information, offering new
opportunities to improve LDCT reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce
LangMamba, a Language-driven Mamba framework for LDCT denoising that leverages
VLM-derived representations to enhance supervision from normal-dose CT (NDCT).
LangMamba follows a two-stage learning strategy. First, we pre-train a
Language-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) that leverages frozen VLMs to map NDCT
images into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. Second, we
synergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising:
Semantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local
semantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and
Language-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that
denoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba
outperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving
detail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong
generalizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs.
Furthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided
insights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion. Our
findings shed new light on the potential of language as a supervisory signal to
advance LDCT denoising. The code is publicly available on
https://github.com/hao1635/LangMamba.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有脑机接口模型因个体脑活动差异导致的跨被试适应性差的问题。

Method: 1) 为每个被试训练个性化模型；2) 将个性化模型转换为关系谱；3) 通过统计分析识别共同特征；4) 基于共同特征构建跨被试通用模型。

Result: 在BCIC IV 2a数据集上验证，性能比现有方法提升3.28%。

Conclusion: 首次提出提取纯共同特征并构建跨被试通用模型的方法，推动脑机接口技术的广泛应用。

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) enables direct
control of external devices by decoding the electroencephalogram (EEG)
generated in the brain during imagined movements. However, due to
inter-individual variability in brain activity, existing BCI models exhibit
poor adaptability across subjects, thereby limiting their generalizability and
widespread application. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
cross-subject BCI algorithm named Cross-Subject DD (CSDD), which constructs a
universal BCI model by extracting common features across subjects. The specific
methods include: 1) training personalized models for each subject; 2)
transforming personalized models into relation spectrums; 3) identifying common
features through statistical analysis; and 4) constructing a cross-subject
universal model based on common features. The experiments utilized the BCIC IV
2a dataset, involving nine subjects. Eight of these subjects were selected for
training and extracing the common features, and the cross-subject decoding
performance of the model was validated on the remaining subject. The results
demonstrate that, compared with existing similar methods, our approach achieves
a 3.28% improvement in performance. This paper introduces for the first time a
novel method for extracting pure common features and constructing a universal
cross-subject BCI model, thereby facilitating broader applications of BCI
technology.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（如ChatGPT和Gemini）在解决编程错误时存在计算成本高和过度辅助的问题，不适合广泛教育应用。

Method: 使用40,000条C编译器错误数据集对Qwen3-4B、Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen3-32B进行监督微调，并结合专家评审和自动化评估。

Result: SFT显著提升小型模型的教学质量，性能接近大型模型，验证了高效小模型的潜力。

Conclusion: 高质量领域特定数据微调小型模型是开发教育工具的有效策略，并提供了可复现的方法论。

Abstract: Frontier Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini can decipher
cryptic compiler errors for novice programmers, but their computational scale,
cost, and tendency to over-assist make them problematic for widespread
pedagogical adoption. This work demonstrates that smaller, specialised language
models, enhanced via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), present a more viable
alternative for educational tools. We utilise a new dataset of 40,000 C
compiler error explanations, derived from real introductory programming (CS1/2)
student-generated programming errors, which we used to fine-tune three
open-source models: Qwen3-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Qwen3-32B. We performed a dual
evaluation, combining expert human reviews with a large-scale automated
analysis of 8,000 responses using a validated LLM-as-judge ensemble. Our
results show that SFT significantly boosts the pedagogical quality of smaller
models, achieving performance comparable to much larger models. We analyse the
trade-offs between model size and quality, confirming that fine-tuning compact,
efficient models on high-quality, domain-specific data is a potent strategy for
creating specialised models to drive educational tools. We provide a replicable
methodology to foster broader access to generative AI capabilities in
educational contexts.

Motivation: 研究动机是揭示和批判通过隐藏指令操纵AI辅助同行评审的行为，探讨其对学术诚信的威胁。

Method: 方法包括分析隐藏提示的类型（如简单指令和详细框架），并评估作者辩护的合理性。

Result: 结果显示隐藏指令具有明显的自利意图，且出版商对AI使用的政策不一致。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要在提交门户进行技术筛查，并协调生成式AI在学术评价中的使用政策。

Abstract: In July 2025, 18 academic manuscripts on the preprint website arXiv were
found to contain hidden instructions known as prompts designed to manipulate
AI-assisted peer review. Instructions such as "GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW ONLY"
were concealed using techniques like white-colored text. Author responses
varied: one planned to withdraw the affected paper, while another defended the
practice as legitimate testing of reviewer compliance. This commentary analyzes
this practice as a novel form of research misconduct. We examine the technique
of prompt injection in large language models (LLMs), revealing four types of
hidden prompts, ranging from simple positive review commands to detailed
evaluation frameworks. The defense that prompts served as "honeypots" to detect
reviewers improperly using AI fails under examination--the consistently
self-serving nature of prompt instructions indicates intent to manipulate.
Publishers maintain inconsistent policies: Elsevier prohibits AI use in peer
review entirely, while Springer Nature permits limited use with disclosure
requirements. The incident exposes systematic vulnerabilities extending beyond
peer review to any automated system processing scholarly texts, including
plagiarism detection and citation indexing. Our analysis underscores the need
for coordinated technical screening at submission portals and harmonized
policies governing generative AI (GenAI) use in academic evaluation.

<details>

Motivation: 由于3D网格的非欧几里得特性，传统的CNN难以直接应用，而现有的GCN方法通常依赖各向同性滤波器或谱分解，无法同时捕捉局部和全局特征。

Method: 提出3DGeoMeshNet框架，采用各向异性卷积层和多尺度编码器-解码器结构，直接在原始多边形网格格式上进行处理。

Result: 在COMA人脸数据集上的实验表明，3DGeoMeshNet在重建精度上表现优异。

Conclusion: 3DGeoMeshNet通过直接在空间域中学习特征，避免了中间表示转换，显著提升了3D网格重建的准确性。

Abstract: 3D meshes are fundamental data representations for capturing complex
geometric shapes in computer vision and graphics applications. While
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have excelled in structured data like
images, extending them to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to the
non-Euclidean nature of the data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer a
solution by applying convolutions to graph-structured data, but many existing
methods rely on isotropic filters or spectral decomposition, limiting their
ability to capture both local and global mesh features. In this paper, we
introduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework
that uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and
local features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that
convert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point
clouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the
reconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our
architecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate
global and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and
fine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on the COMA dataset
containing human faces demonstrate the efficiency of 3DGeoMeshNet in terms of
reconstruction accuracy.

Motivation: 传统3DGS需要高质量图像覆盖整个场景，限制了普通用户的可用性。本文旨在通过简单的手持设备拍摄实现高质量渲染。

Method: 利用粗略几何先验（如相机位姿和单目深度估计）和室内平面结构，提出平面支架组装初始化方法和稳定剪枝策略，并引入几何和光度校正。

Result: 在真实和合成室内场景测试中，LighthouseGS实现了逼真渲染，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: LighthouseGS展示了全景视图合成和物体放置的潜力，为手持设备拍摄提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time novel
view synthesis (NVS) with impressive quality in indoor scenes. However,
achieving high-fidelity rendering requires meticulously captured images
covering the entire scene, limiting accessibility for general users. We aim to
develop a practical 3DGS-based NVS framework using simple panorama-style motion
with a handheld camera (e.g., mobile device). While convenient, this
rotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D
point estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To
address these challenges, we propose LighthouseGS, a novel framework inspired
by the lighthouse-like sweeping motion of panoramic views. LighthouseGS
leverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and
monocular depth estimation, and utilizes the planar structures often found in
indoor environments. We present a new initialization method called plane
scaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures,
followed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization
stability. Additionally, we introduce geometric and photometric corrections to
resolve inconsistencies from motion drift and auto-exposure in mobile devices.
Tested on collected real and synthetic indoor scenes, LighthouseGS delivers
photorealistic rendering, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating
the potential for panoramic view synthesis and object placement.

Result: 实验评估16种LLM，揭示了它们在工程场景中的不同能力。

Conclusion: CoreCodeBench为LLM在真实工程项目的适用性提供了多维度的评估工具。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly sophisticated code
processing capabilities, evaluating their performance on engineering-level code
remains challenging. Existing repository-level benchmarks primarily focus on
single scenarios, such as code generation or bug fixing, without adequately
capturing the diversity and complexity of real-world software or project
engineering workflows. Furthermore, these benchmarks suffer from limited
controllability in question positioning and reliability issues in their
generated test cases. To address these limitations, we present CorePipe, a
fully automated pipeline that converts repositories into comprehensive test
cases, and introduce CoreCodeBench, a configurable multi-scenario
repository-level benchmark. To simulate real engineering scenarios, CorePipe
generates three types of atomic questions (Development, BugFix, and Test-Driven
Development) specifically targeting core code segments. These atomic questions
are further combined into three types of composite questions, with difficulty
levels flexibly adjusted through hyperparameter tuning. CoreCodeBench provides
a comprehensive and extensive repository-level benchmark to investigate the
applicability of LLMs in real-world engineering projects. Experiments with 16
LLMs across diverse scenarios reveal varying capabilities and offer
multi-dimensional insights into LLM performance in engineering contexts. The
code for CorePipe is available at

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle technology has been developed in the last decades with
recent advances in sensing and computing technology. There is an urgent need to
ensure the reliability and robustness of autonomous driving systems (ADSs).
Despite the recent achievements in testing various ADS modules, little
attention has been paid on the automated testing of traffic light detection
models in ADSs. A common practice is to manually collect and label traffic
light data. However, it is labor-intensive, and even impossible to collect
diverse data under different driving environments.
  To address these problems, we propose and implement TigAug to automatically
augment labeled traffic light images for testing traffic light detection models
in ADSs. We construct two families of metamorphic relations and three families
of transformations based on a systematic understanding of weather environments,
camera properties, and traffic light properties. We use augmented images to
detect erroneous behaviors of traffic light detection models by
transformation-specific metamorphic relations, and to improve the performance
of traffic light detection models by retraining. Large-scale experiments with
four state-of-the-art traffic light detection models and two traffic light
datasets have demonstrated that i) TigAug is effective in testing traffic light
detection models, ii) TigAug is efficient in synthesizing traffic light images,
and iii) TigAug generates traffic light images with acceptable naturalness.

*Nehal Baganal Krishna,Anam Tahir,Firas Khamis,Mina Tahmasbi Arashloo,Michael Zink,Amr Rizk*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种网络数据平面加速架构，通过内联处理DRL模型更新来减少异步分布式强化学习中的陈旧性，从而提高收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异步分布式强化学习（DRL）在大规模训练中可能因网络拥塞和数据包丢失导致模型更新陈旧，影响收敛速度。

Method: 设计了一种新颖的队列机制，合并兼容的更新以减少冗余流量，并提供了轻量级的传输控制机制。引入了Age-of-Model（AoM）度量作为陈旧性的代理。

Result: 该架构显著减少了更新陈旧性和拥塞，提高了异步DRL工作负载的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 网络数据平面加速架构有效解决了异步DRL中的陈旧性问题，提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Asynchronous Distributed Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can suffer from
degraded convergence when model updates become stale, often the result of
network congestion and packet loss during large-scale training. This work
introduces a network data-plane acceleration architecture that mitigates such
staleness by enabling inline processing of DRL model updates as they traverse
the accelerator engine. To this end, we design and prototype a novel queueing
mechanism that opportunistically combines compatible updates sharing a network
element, reducing redundant traffic and preserving update utility.
Complementing this we provide a lightweight transmission control mechanism at
the worker nodes that is guided by feedback from the in-network accelerator. To
assess model utility at line rate, we introduce the Age-of-Model (AoM) metric
as a proxy for staleness and verify global fairness and responsiveness
properties using a formal verification method. Our evaluations demonstrate that
this architecture significantly reduces update staleness and congestion,
ultimately improving the convergence rate in asynchronous DRL workloads.

*Sanaz Kazemi Abharian,Sai Manoj Pudukotai Dinakarrao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对图神经网络（GNNs）的硬件故障攻击方法（GBFA），通过逐层翻转权重参数中的比特，显著降低模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GNNs在图形数据上表现优异，但其硬件加速器的安全性问题被忽视，尤其是硬件故障攻击的潜在威胁。

Method: GBFA采用两步策略：1）基于马尔可夫模型预测攻击层；2）通过梯度排序识别易受攻击的比特并翻转。

Result: 实验表明，GBFA能显著降低GNNs的预测准确率（如GraphSAGE在Cora数据集上准确率下降17%）。

Conclusion: 层感知攻击策略对GNNs的安全性至关重要，需重视硬件层面的防护。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful machine learning
method for graph-structured data. A plethora of hardware accelerators has been
introduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.
However, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally
overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to
hardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output
by modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory
device. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware
bit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight
gradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of
bits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is
created to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted
from memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a
specific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the
selected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node
classification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that
GBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its
impact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a
layer-aware attack strategy in GNNs. For example, GBFA degrades GraphSAGE's
prediction accuracy by 17% on the Cora dataset with only a single bit flip in
the last layer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值模拟成本高，数据驱动模型在预测对流过程时表现不佳，需要一种高效且准确的替代方法。

Method: 采用Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN)，结合轻量级数值替代模型（全局）和卷积神经网络（局部）处理地下水速度和热扩散过程。

Result: LGCNN成功模拟了城市范围内的地下温度场，并在真实数据上表现出良好的泛化能力，无需重新训练即可扩展到更大区域。

Conclusion: LGCNN为复杂地下水流动与热传输问题提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，代码和数据已公开以促进可重复性。

Abstract: Machine learning methods often struggle with real-world applications in
science and engineering due to limited or low-quality training data. In this
work, the example of groundwater flow with heat transport is considered; this
corresponds to an advection-diffusion process under heterogeneous flow
conditions, that is, spatially distributed material parameters and heat
sources. Classical numerical simulations are costly and challenging due to high
spatio-temporal resolution requirements and large domains. While often
computationally more efficient, purely data-driven surrogate models face
difficulties, particularly in predicting the advection process, which is highly
sensitive to input variations and involves long-range spatial interactions.
Therefore, in this work, a Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN)
approach is introduced. It combines a lightweight numerical surrogate for the
transport process (global) with convolutional neural networks for the
groundwater velocity and heat diffusion processes (local). With the LGCNN, a
city-wide subsurface temperature field is modeled, involving a heterogeneous
groundwater flow field and one hundred groundwater heat pump injection points
forming interacting heat plumes over long distances. The model is first
systematically analyzed based on random subsurface input fields. Then, the
model is trained on a handful of cut-outs from a real-world subsurface map of
the Munich region in Germany, and it scales to larger cut-outs without
retraining. All datasets, our code, and trained models are published for
reproducibility.

TL;DR: 本文比较了持续后训练（CPT）中的监督微调（SFT）和强化微调（RFT），发现RFT在知识保留和通用能力上优于SFT，并提出了一种改进RFT稳定性的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索持续后训练中学习范式（SFT和RFT）对知识保留的影响，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 在七个多模态任务上使用Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct模型进行实验，比较SFT和RFT的表现。

Result: RFT能保留先验知识且性能接近多任务训练，而SFT会导致灾难性遗忘；RFT还能提升通用能力。

Conclusion: RFT是持续后训练的稳健范式，其隐式正则化是关键因素。

Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for
adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific
and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily
concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter
regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two
core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge
retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising
seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base
model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant
findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to
catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT
inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to
multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the
model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).
Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis
shows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought
reasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit
regularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.
Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the
stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the
superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

Result: 揭示了记忆现象的关键驱动因素和检测方法的有效性，同时探讨了法律伦理问题。

Conclusion: 本文全面总结了LLMs记忆研究的现状，提出了未来研究方向，强调在减少有害记忆与保持模型性能之间的平衡挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet they also exhibit memorization of their training
data. This phenomenon raises critical questions about model behavior, privacy
risks, and the boundary between learning and memorization. Addressing these
concerns, this paper synthesizes recent studies and investigates the landscape
of memorization, the factors influencing it, and methods for its detection and
mitigation. We explore key drivers, including training data duplication,
training dynamics, and fine-tuning procedures that influence data memorization.
In addition, we examine methodologies such as prefix-based extraction,
membership inference, and adversarial prompting, assessing their effectiveness
in detecting and measuring memorized content. Beyond technical analysis, we
also explore the broader implications of memorization, including the legal and
ethical implications. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies, including data
cleaning, differential privacy, and post-training unlearning, while
highlighting open challenges in balancing the minimization of harmful
memorization with utility. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
current state of research on LLM memorization across technical, privacy, and
performance dimensions, identifying critical directions for future work.

TL;DR: AutoTriton是一个基于强化学习的模型，用于自动优化Triton编程中的关键参数，减少手动调优的负担，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中的内核开发需要手动调优关键参数，如瓦片大小和内存访问模式，这阻碍了性能优化和广泛采用。

Method: AutoTriton通过监督微调（SFT）学习Triton编程知识，并使用强化学习（RL）结合规则和执行的奖励策略进一步优化。

Result: 实验表明，AutoTriton在性能上可与主流大模型媲美，验证了其模块（SFT、RL和奖励设计）的重要性。

Conclusion: AutoTriton展示了强化学习在自动生成高性能内核中的潜力，为构建更高效的AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Kernel development in deep learning requires optimizing computational units
across hardware while balancing memory management, parallelism, and
hardware-specific optimizations through extensive empirical tuning. Although
domain-specific languages like Triton simplify GPU programming by abstracting
low-level details, developers must still manually tune critical parameters such
as tile sizes and memory access patterns through iterative experimentation,
creating substantial barriers to optimal performance and wider adoption. In
this work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton
programming powered by reinforcement learning (RL). AutoTriton performs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to be equipped with essential Triton programming
expertise using a high-quality data gathering pipeline, and conducts RL with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, combining a rule-based
reward and an execution-based reward to further improve Triton programming
ability, sequentially. Experiments across five evaluation channels of
TritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves
performance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet
and DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial
role of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage,
and the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for
automatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance
kernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an
important foundation for building more efficient AI systems. The model and code
will be available at https://github.com/AI9Stars/AutoTriton.

Motivation: 现有GUI代理大多在离线环境中训练，导致可扩展性差、对特定UI模板过拟合，且在未见环境中策略脆弱。

Method: MobileGUI-RL通过自探索和任务筛选合成学习任务课程，并改进GRPO算法，结合轨迹感知优势和复合奖励。

Result: 在三个在线移动代理基准测试中表现优异，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MobileGUI-RL通过在线训练和任务课程设计，显著提升了GUI代理的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of vision-based GUI agents designed to
automate everyday mobile and web tasks. These agents interpret raw GUI
screenshots and autonomously decide where to click, scroll, or type, which
bypasses handcrafted rules and app-specific APIs. However, most existing
methods trained GUI agent in the offline environment using pre-collected
trajectories. This approach limits scalability, causes overfitting to specific
UI templates, and leads to brittle policies when faced with unseen environment.
We present MobileGUI-RL, a scalable framework that trains GUI agent in online
environment. MobileGUI-RL contains two key components. It (i) synthesizes a
curriculum of learnable tasks through self-exploration and filtering, and (ii)
adapts GRPO to GUI navigation with trajectory-aware advantages and composite
rewards that balance task success and execution efficiency. Experiments on
three online mobile-agent benchmarks show consistent gains, validating the
effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 序列模型（如Transformer和RNN）常将过多注意力分配给无关上下文，导致噪声中间表示，进而影响模型性能。本文旨在探索差分设计是否适用于Mamba架构，以提升其效率。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的差分机制，对Mamba进行架构修改，并通过语言建模基准进行实证验证。

Result: 改进后的Mamba在检索能力和性能上优于原始版本，有效缓解了注意力分配不均的问题。

Conclusion: 研究表明，差分设计需针对Mamba进行特定调整，改进后的架构显著提升了模型性能，代码已公开。

Abstract: Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to
irrelevant context, leading to noisy intermediate representations. This
degrades LLM capabilities by promoting hallucinations, weakening long-range and
retrieval abilities, and reducing robustness. Recent work has shown that
differential design can mitigate this issue in Transformers, improving their
effectiveness across various applications. In this paper, we explore whether
these techniques, originally developed for Transformers, can be applied to
Mamba, a recent architecture based on selective state-space layers that
achieves Transformer-level performance with greater efficiency. We show that a
naive adaptation of differential design to Mamba is insufficient and requires
careful architectural modifications. To address this, we introduce a novel
differential mechanism for Mamba, empirically validated on language modeling
benchmarks, demonstrating improved retrieval capabilities and superior
performance over vanilla Mamba. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies
and empirical analyses to justify our design choices and provide evidence that
our approach effectively mitigates the overallocation problem in Mamba-based
models. Our code is publicly available.

Motivation: 软组织的模拟在医疗应用中日益重要，但其高变形性带来了显著挑战。现有方法依赖分割、网格化和刚度估计，且需要精确的力反馈。

Method: 使用条件图神经网络（cGNN），输入表面点和外力位置，预测变形和受力。通过实验数据和迁移学习（先训练质量-弹簧模拟，再微调实验数据）提高泛化能力。

Result: 模型预测变形误差为0.35±0.03 mm（变形≤30 mm），力误差为0.37±0.05 N（力≤7.5 N）。

Conclusion: 该数据驱动方法为虚拟环境中的软组织模拟提供了有效解决方案，并具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Soft tissue simulation in virtual environments is becoming increasingly
important for medical applications. However, the high deformability of soft
tissue poses significant challenges. Existing methods rely on segmentation,
meshing and estimation of stiffness properties of tissues. In addition, the
integration of haptic feedback requires precise force estimation to enable a
more immersive experience. We introduce a novel data-driven model, a
conditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity. Our model
takes surface points and the location of applied forces, and is specifically
designed to predict the deformation of the points and the forces exerted on
them. We trained our model on experimentally collected surface tracking data of
a soft tissue phantom and used transfer learning to overcome the data scarcity
by initially training it with mass-spring simulations and fine-tuning it with
the experimental data. This approach improves the generalisation capability of
the model and enables accurate predictions of tissue deformations and
corresponding interaction forces. The results demonstrate that the model can
predict deformations with a distance error of 0.35$\pm$0.03 mm for deformations
up to 30 mm and the force with an absolute error of 0.37$\pm$0.05 N for forces
up to 7.5 N. Our data-driven approach presents a promising solution to the
intricate challenge of simulating soft tissues within virtual environments.
Beyond its applicability in medical simulations, this approach holds the
potential to benefit various fields where realistic soft tissue simulations are
required.

Result: 揭示了模型内部的潜在电路和信息流，帮助识别虚假关联并增强模型可信度。

Conclusion: BAGEL框架为理解深度学习模型的泛化能力提供了新视角，尤其在处理数据集偏差时表现突出。

Abstract: While concept-based interpretability methods have traditionally focused on
local explanations of neural network predictions, we propose a novel framework
and interactive tool that extends these methods into the domain of mechanistic
interpretability. Our approach enables a global dissection of model behavior by
analyzing how high-level semantic attributes (referred to as concepts) emerge,
interact, and propagate through internal model components. Unlike prior work
that isolates individual neurons or predictions, our framework systematically
quantifies how semantic concepts are represented across layers, revealing
latent circuits and information flow that underlie model decision-making. A key
innovation is our visualization platform that we named BAGEL (for Bias Analysis
with a Graph for global Explanation Layers), which presents these insights in a
structured knowledge graph, allowing users to explore concept-class
relationships, identify spurious correlations, and enhance model
trustworthiness. Our framework is model-agnostic, scalable, and contributes to
a deeper understanding of how deep learning models generalize (or fail to) in
the presence of dataset biases. The demonstration is available at

Motivation: 领域泛化和算法公平性在机器学习中各自独立研究，但缺乏结合两者的方法。FairDG旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出基于互信息的上界分析，设计PAFDG框架，通过帕累托优化建模效用-公平权衡。

Result: 在真实视觉和语言数据集上，PAFDG优于现有方法，实现了更好的效用-公平权衡。

Conclusion: PAFDG为领域泛化和算法公平性的结合提供了有效解决方案，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness are two critical
challenges in machine learning. However, most DG methods focus only on
minimizing expected risk in the unseen target domain without considering
algorithmic fairness. Conversely, fairness methods typically do not account for
domain shifts, so the fairness achieved during training may not generalize to
unseen test domains. In this work, we bridge these gaps by studying the problem
of Fair Domain Generalization (FairDG), which aims to minimize both expected
risk and fairness violations in unseen target domains. We derive novel mutual
information-based upper bounds for expected risk and fairness violations in
multi-class classification tasks with multi-group sensitive attributes. These
bounds provide key insights for algorithm design from an information-theoretic
perspective. Guided by these insights, we introduce PAFDG (Pareto-Optimal
Fairness for Domain Generalization), a practical framework that solves the
FairDG problem and models the utility-fairness trade-off through Pareto
optimization. Experiments on real-world vision and language datasets show that
PAFDG achieves superior utility-fairness trade-offs compared to existing
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR环境中用户佩戴头戴设备（HMD）时难以进行双因素认证，因此需要一种无需摘除HMD的解决方案。

Method: 提出NRXR-ID技术，通过智能手机完成认证挑战，包括四种挑战类型（如棋盘式挑战）和三种配置（如基于凝视的选择）。

Result: 棋盘式视觉匹配挑战效果最佳，其次是数字PIN挑战。

Conclusion: NRXR-ID为VR环境中的双因素认证提供了可行方案，棋盘式挑战表现最优。

Abstract: Two-factor authentication (2FA) has become widely adopted as an efficient and
secure way to validate someone's identity online. Two-factor authentication is
difficult in virtual reality (VR) because users are usually wearing a
head-mounted display (HMD) which does not allow them to see their real-world
surroundings. We present NRXR-ID, a technique to implement two-factor
authentication while using extended reality systems and smartphones. The
proposed method allows users to complete an authentication challenge using
their smartphones without removing their HMD. We performed a user study where
we explored four types of challenges for users, including a novel
checkers-style challenge. Users responded to these challenges under three
different configurations, including a technique that uses the smartphone to
support gaze-based selection without the use of VR controllers. A 4X3
within-subjects design allowed us to study all the variations proposed. We
collected performance metrics and performed user experience questionnaires to
collect subjective impressions from 30 participants. Results suggest that the
checkers-style visual matching challenge was the most appropriate option,
followed by entering a digital PIN challenge submitted via the smartphone and
answered within the VR environment.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提高了对间歇性热木马攻击的检测能力和保护效果。

Abstract: Thermal Trojan attacks present a pressing concern for the security and
reliability of System-on-Chips (SoCs), especially in mobile applications. The
situation becomes more complicated when such attacks are more evasive and
operate sporadically to stay hidden from detection mechanisms. In this paper,
we introduce Intermittent Thermal Trojans (iThermTroj) that exploit the chips'
thermal information in a random time-triggered manner. According to our
experiments, iThermTroj attack can easily bypass available threshold-based
thermal Trojan detection solutions. We investigate SoC vulnerabilities to
variations of iThermTroj through an in-depth analysis of Trojan activation and
duration scenarios. We also propose a set of tiny Machine Learning classifiers
for run-time anomaly detection to protect SoCs against such intermittent
thermal Trojan attacks. Compared to existing methods, our approach improves the
attack detection rate by 29.4\%, 17.2\%, and 14.3\% in scenarios where
iThermTroj manipulates up to 80\%, 60\%, and 40\% of SoC's thermal data,
respectively. Additionally, our method increases the full protection resolution
to 0.8 degrees Celsius, meaning that any temperature manipulations exceeding
$\pm 0.8$ degrees will be detected with 100\% accuracy.

conversational AI. Chatbots are increasingly being developed by customizing
LLMs on specific conversational datasets. However, mitigating toxicity during
this customization, especially when dealing with untrusted training data,
remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce TuneShield, a
defense framework designed to mitigate toxicity during chatbot fine-tuning
while preserving conversational quality. TuneShield leverages LLM-based
toxicity classification, utilizing the instruction-following capabilities and
safety alignment of LLMs to effectively identify toxic samples, outperforming
industry API services. TuneShield generates synthetic conversation samples,
termed 'healing data', based on the identified toxic samples, using them to
mitigate toxicity while reinforcing desirable behavior during fine-tuning. It
performs an alignment process to further nudge the chatbot towards producing
desired responses. Our findings show that TuneShield effectively mitigates
toxicity injection attacks while preserving conversational quality, even when
the toxicity classifiers are imperfect or biased. TuneShield proves to be
resilient against adaptive adversarial and jailbreak attacks. Additionally,
TuneShield demonstrates effectiveness in mitigating adaptive toxicity injection
attacks during dialog-based learning (DBL).

TL;DR: 论文提出了ContextASR-Bench，一个用于评估上下文语音识别的大规模基准，涵盖40,000条数据，10多个领域，并分析了模型在识别命名实体方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR模型在上下文建模和世界知识推理方面能力有限，而LLMs和LALMs的发展提升了通用AI能力，因此需要一个评估ASR系统通用性和智能性的基准。

Method: 提出ContextASR-Bench基准，包含40,000条数据，覆盖10多个领域，评估模型在有无上下文信息时的表现，并分析命名实体识别能力。

Result: LALMs凭借强大的世界知识和上下文学习能力，显著优于传统ASR模型。

Conclusion: ContextASR-Bench填补了评估上下文语音识别的空白，展示了LALMs的优越性，并公开了数据集和评估代码。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been extensively investigated, yet
prior evaluative efforts have largely been restricted to contextless paradigms.
This constraint stems from the limited proficiency of conventional ASR models
in context modeling and their deficiency in memory and reasoning based on world
knowledge. Recent breakthroughs in the development of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and corresponding Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have markedly
enhanced the visibility of general artificial intelligence capabilities.
Consequently, there exists a compelling need for a benchmark that can evaluate
both the generality and intelligence of ASR systems. To address this gap, we
propose ContextASR-Bench: a comprehensive, large-scale benchmark designed to
assess contextual speech recognition. This benchmark encompasses up to 40,000
data entries across over 10 domains, enabling a thorough evaluation of model
performance in scenarios that omit or incorporate coarse-grained or
fine-grained contextual information. Moreover, diverging from conventional ASR
evaluations, our benchmark includes an analysis of model efficacy in
recognizing named entities mentioned within the auditory input. Our extensive
evaluation highlights that LALMs, with strong world knowledge and context
learning capabilities, outperform conventional ASR models by a large margin.
The dataset and evaluation code have been released at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种主动防御范式，通过知识可信性、推理可靠性和输入鲁棒性三大支柱框架，显著提升大语言模型（LLMs）对抗虚假信息的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型生成的虚假信息具有自我强化、高度可信和多语言快速传播的特点，传统检测方法难以有效应对，亟需主动防御策略。

Method: 提出Three Pillars框架：知识可信性（强化数据完整性）、推理可靠性（嵌入自校正机制）和输入鲁棒性（增强模型接口抗攻击能力）。

Result: 主动防御策略在虚假信息预防上比传统方法提升63%，尽管存在计算开销和泛化挑战。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注知识基础、推理认证和抗攻击接口的协同设计，以提升LLMs对抗虚假信息的能力。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) across critical
domains has amplified the societal risks posed by algorithmically generated
misinformation. Unlike traditional false content, LLM-generated misinformation
can be self-reinforcing, highly plausible, and capable of rapid propagation
across multiple languages, which traditional detection methods fail to mitigate
effectively. This paper introduces a proactive defense paradigm, shifting from
passive post hoc detection to anticipatory mitigation strategies. We propose a
Three Pillars framework: (1) Knowledge Credibility, fortifying the integrity of
training and deployed data; (2) Inference Reliability, embedding
self-corrective mechanisms during reasoning; and (3) Input Robustness,
enhancing the resilience of model interfaces against adversarial attacks.
Through a comprehensive survey of existing techniques and a comparative
meta-analysis, we demonstrate that proactive defense strategies offer up to
63\% improvement over conventional methods in misinformation prevention,
despite non-trivial computational overhead and generalization challenges. We
argue that future research should focus on co-designing robust knowledge
foundations, reasoning certification, and attack-resistant interfaces to ensure
LLMs can effectively counter misinformation across varied domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解AI搜索系统作为信息把关者的引用行为及其对用户的影响。

Method: 通过分析AI Search Arena平台的24,000次对话和65,000条回答，研究366,000次引用中的新闻引用模式。

Result: 新闻引用集中在少数媒体，存在自由派偏见，但低可信度来源较少被引用；用户满意度不受引用来源政治倾向或质量影响。

Conclusion: 当前AI搜索系统存在显著挑战，对其设计和治理有重要启示。

Abstract: AI-powered search systems are emerging as new information gatekeepers,
fundamentally transforming how users access news and information. Despite their
growing influence, the citation patterns of these systems remain poorly
understood. We address this gap by analyzing data from the AI Search Arena, a
head-to-head evaluation platform for AI search systems. The dataset comprises
over 24,000 conversations and 65,000 responses from models across three major
providers: OpenAI, Perplexity, and Google. Among the over 366,000 citations
embedded in these responses, 9% reference news sources. We find that while
models from different providers cite distinct news sources, they exhibit shared
patterns in citation behavior. News citations concentrate heavily among a small
number of outlets and display a pronounced liberal bias, though low-credibility
sources are rarely cited. User preference analysis reveals that neither the
political leaning nor the quality of cited news sources significantly
influences user satisfaction. These findings reveal significant challenges in
current AI search systems and have important implications for their design and
governance.

Abstract: Biomedical semantic question answering rooted in information retrieval can
play a crucial role in keeping up to date with vast, rapidly evolving and
ever-growing biomedical literature. A robust system can help researchers,
healthcare professionals and even layman users access relevant knowledge
grounded in evidence. The BioASQ 2025 Task13b Challenge serves as an important
benchmark, offering a competitive platform for advancement of this space. This
paper presents the methodologies and results from our participation in this
challenge where we built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that can
answer biomedical questions by retrieving relevant PubMed documents and
snippets to generate answers. For the retrieval task, we generated dense
embeddings from biomedical articles for initial retrieval, and applied an
ensemble of finetuned cross-encoders and large language models (LLMs) for
re-ranking to identify top relevant documents. Our solution achieved an MAP@10
of 0.1581, placing 10th on the leaderboard for the retrieval task. For answer
generation, we employed few-shot prompting of instruction-tuned LLMs. Our
system achieved macro-F1 score of 0.95 for yes/no questions (rank 12), Mean
Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.64 for factoid questions (rank 1), mean-F1 score of
0.63 for list questions (rank 5), and ROUGE-SU4 F1 score of 0.29 for ideal
answers (rank 11).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到高质量嵌入在嵌入空间中占据几何稳定的区域并表现出一致的邻域结构。

Method: 结合量化鲁棒性和邻域密度指标，预测查询级别的检索性能。

Result: 在4个标准检索数据集上，Recall@10平均提升9.4±1.2%，计算开销低（少于检索时间的5%）。

Conclusion: 框架能实现自适应检索策略，并为针对性训练数据增强提供见解。

Abstract: Vector retrieval systems exhibit significant performance variance across
queries due to heterogeneous embedding quality. We propose a lightweight
framework for predicting retrieval performance at the query level by combining
quantization robustness and neighborhood density metrics. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that high-quality embeddings occupy geometrically
stable regions in the embedding space and exhibit consistent neighborhood
structures. We evaluate our method on 4 standard retrieval datasets, showing
consistent improvements of 9.4$\pm$1.2\% in Recall@10 over competitive
baselines. The framework requires minimal computational overhead (less than 5\%
of retrieval time) and enables adaptive retrieval strategies. Our analysis
reveals systematic patterns in embedding quality across different query types,
providing insights for targeted training data augmentation.

Conclusion: Nyay-Darpan展示了实用性，并将公开框架和数据集以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: AI-based judicial assistance and case prediction have been extensively
studied in criminal and civil domains, but remain largely unexplored in
consumer law, especially in India. In this paper, we present Nyay-Darpan, a
novel two-in-one framework that (i) summarizes consumer case files and (ii)
retrieves similar case judgements to aid decision-making in consumer dispute
resolution. Our methodology not only addresses the gap in consumer law AI tools
but also introduces an innovative approach to evaluate the quality of the
summary. The term 'Nyay-Darpan' translates into 'Mirror of Justice',
symbolizing the ability of our tool to reflect the core of consumer disputes
through precise summarization and intelligent case retrieval. Our system
achieves over 75 percent accuracy in similar case prediction and approximately
70 percent accuracy across material summary evaluation metrics, demonstrating
its practical effectiveness. We will publicly release the Nyay-Darpan framework
and dataset to promote reproducibility and facilitate further research in this
underexplored yet impactful domain.

Conclusion: 区块链三难问题并非架构定律，而是由不精确性和设计失败主义维持的启发式谬误。

Abstract: The so-called blockchain trilemma asserts the impossibility of simultaneously
achieving scalability, security, and decentralisation within a single
blockchain protocol. In this paper, we formally refute that proposition.
Employing predicate logic, formal automata theory, computational complexity
analysis, and graph-theoretic measures of relay topology--specifically Baran's
model of network path redundancy--we demonstrate that the trilemma constitutes
a category error, conflates distinct analytical domains, and relies upon
unproven causal assumptions. We further expose its reliance on composition
fallacies drawn from flawed system implementations. A constructive
counterexample is presented: a blockchain protocol exhibiting unbounded
transaction throughput, cryptographic security under adversarial load, and
multipath decentralised propagation. This example is not hypothetical but
grounded in protocol design enabled by compact block relay, SPV verification,
and IPv6 multicast. The trilemma is revealed not as a law of protocol
architecture, but as a heuristic fallacy sustained by imprecision and design
defeatism.
