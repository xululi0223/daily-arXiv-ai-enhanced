Its\ndifficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image\nsequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance\nbetween these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image\nCaptioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant\nstudies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for\nobtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are\ntransformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our\nmultifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling\nunder a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced\nstories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach\naccelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and\nreproducible by anyone interested. Lastly, we propose a new metric/tool, named\nideality, that can be used to simulate how far some results are from an oracle\nmodel, and we apply it to emulate human-likeness in visual storytelling."}

Post-training quantization\n(PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language\nModels (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced\ngeneralization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a\n16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key\nmechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention -\nclash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation\nand dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding\nsteps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods;\n2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during\niteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps\nprogress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic,\nmaking overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To\naddress these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,\nwhich incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling\n(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with\nthe capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware\nActivation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's\ninteraction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)\nCertainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token\nscores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight\nquantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves\nsignificant performance gains while enhancing efficiency."}

In addition, we propose a\nnew directed-token approach to capture visual and textual knowledge, enabling\nthe capability to reconstruct the correct order of visual inputs. Then, we\nintroduce a new Image-to-Response Guided loss to further improve the visual\nunderstanding of the LMM in its responses. The proposed approach consistently\nachieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance compared with prior LMMs on\nacademic task-oriented and instruction-following LMM benchmarks."}

SurveyGen-I first performs\nsurvey-level retrieval to construct the initial outline and writing plan, and\nthen dynamically refines both during generation through a memory mechanism that\nstores previously written content and terminology, ensuring coherence across\nsubsections. When the system detects insufficient context, it triggers\nfine-grained subsection-level retrieval. During generation, SurveyGen-I\nleverages this memory mechanism to maintain coherence across subsections.\nExperiments across four scientific domains demonstrate that SurveyGen-I\nconsistently outperforms previous works in content quality, consistency, and\ncitation coverage."}

For analysis and visualization, topological primitives such as\ncontour trees can be used, but these often need simplification to filter out\nsmall-scale features. For parcel-based convective cloud simulations,\nsimplification of the contour tree requires a volumetric measure rather than\npersistence. Unlike for cubic meshes, volume cannot be approximated by counting\nregular vertices. Typically, this is addressed by resampling irregular data\nonto a uniform grid. Unfortunately, the spatial proximity of parcels requires a\nhigh sampling frequency, resulting in a massive increase in data size for\nprocessing. We therefore extend volume-based contour tree simplification to\nparcel-in-cell simulations with a graph adaptor in Viskores (VTK-m), using\nDelaunay tetrahedralization of the parcel centroids as input. Instead of\nrelying on a volume approximation by counting regular vertices -- as was done\nfor cubic meshes -- we adapt the 2D area splines reported by Bajaj et al.\n10.1145/259081.259279, and Zhou et al. 10.1109/TVCG.2018.2796555. We implement\nthis in Viskores (formerly called VTK-m) as prefix-sum style hypersweeps for\nparallel efficiency and show how it can be generalized to compute any\nintegrable property. Finally, our results reveal that contour trees computed\ndirectly on the parcels are orders of magnitude faster than computing them on a\nresampled grid, while also arguably offering better quality segmentation,\navoiding interpolation artifacts."}

Understanding the logical structure of an argument\nrefers to understanding the underlying \"reasons\" which make up the proof or\ndisproof of the premise - as a function of the \"logical atoms\" in the argument.\nWhile it has been shown that transformers can \"chain\" rules to derive simple\narguments, the challenge of articulating the \"reasons\" remains. Not only do\ncurrent approaches to chaining rules suffer in terms of their interpretability,\nthey are also quite constrained in their ability to accommodate extensions to\ntheoretically equivalent reasoning tasks - a model trained to chain rules\ncannot support abduction or identify contradictions. In this work we suggest\naddressing these shortcomings by identifying an intermediate representation\n(which we call the Representation of the Logical Structure (RLS) of the\nargument) that possesses an understanding of the logical structure of a natural\nlanguage argument - the logical atoms in the argument and the rules\nincorporating them.

To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a\nframework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning\nnovel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.\nGiven a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario\nGeneration, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving\nknowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is\nboth plausible and deliberately challenging.

As squeezing\nenhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling\nnoise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning\nimportant data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg\ndiffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse\nscaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales\nonly the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64,\nmild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis -\nconsistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier\ntoward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise\nshaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes."}

However, existing methods often\nrely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets,\nrestricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that\nreconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python\nscripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs\ncapable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we\nconstruct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each\nobject is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a\nmultimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into\nexecutable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior\nperformance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates\nintuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code\nmodifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these\ncontributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for\nprogrammatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding."}

In this paper, we propose\na quite challenging but valuable task to reconstruct the human body from only\ntwo images, i.e., the front and back view, which can largely lower the barrier\nfor users to create their own 3D digital humans. The main challenges lie in the\ndifficulty of building 3D consistency and recovering missing information from\nthe highly sparse input. We redesign a geometry reconstruction model based on\nfoundation reconstruction models to predict consistent point clouds even input\nimages have scarce overlaps with extensive human data training. Furthermore, an\nenhancement algorithm is applied to supplement the missing color information,\nand then the complete human point clouds with colors can be obtained, which are\ndirectly transformed into 3D Gaussians for better rendering quality.\nExperiments show that our method can reconstruct the entire human in 190 ms on\na single NVIDIA RTX 4090, with two images at a resolution of 1024x1024,\ndemonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the THuman2.0 and cross-domain\ndatasets. Additionally, our method can complete human reconstruction even with\nimages captured by low-cost mobile devices, reducing the requirements for data\ncollection.
