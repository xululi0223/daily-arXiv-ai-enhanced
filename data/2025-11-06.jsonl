Without such realistic\nscenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to\nlearn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics,\ndegrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment\nbetween the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for\neffective learning.

Diffusion synthesis increases apparent diversity but,\nwhen trained as common samples, overlooks the structural benefit of mask\nconditioning and introduces synthetic-real domain shift. We propose a paired,\ndiffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real\nimage, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is\nused as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which\nmixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard\nmask. This produces a continuous family of intermediate samples that smoothly\nbridges synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry, enlarging\ndiversity without compromising pixel-level semantics. To keep learning aligned\nwith real data, Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts the\nmixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training, gradually\nre-anchoring optimization to real data and mitigating distributional bias.\nAcross Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC\n2017, the approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and\nconsistent gains over baselines.

This work investigates BPE segmentation recipes\nacross various data volumes and language pairs to evaluate MT system\nperformance. We find that utilizing asymmetric BPE, where the source and target\nlanguages have different NMOs, significantly improves results over the\nsymmetric approach, especially in low-resource settings (50K, 100K, and 500K\nsentence pairs). Specifically, asymmetric BPE yield statistically significant\n($p<0.05$) average gains of 5.32, 4.46, and 0.7 CHRF++ on English-Hindi in\nlow-resource setups. We validated this trend across six additional language\npairs (English and Telugu, Shona, Norwegian, Kyrgyz, Hausa, and Inuktitut),\nobserving statistically significant improvement in 10 out of 12 systems\ncompared to symmetric BPE. Our findings indicate a high NMO for the source (4K\nto 32K) and a low NMO for the target (0.5K to 2K) provides optimal results,\nparticularly benefiting low-resource MT."}

Studies have shown that\nwhen human children learn language, they consistently favor hypotheses based on\nhierarchical syntactic rules without ever encountering disambiguating examples.\nA recent line of work has inquired as to whether common neural network\narchitectures share this bias, finding that they do so only under special\nconditions: when syntactically supervised, when pre-trained on massive corpora,\nor when trained long past convergence. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the\nfirst time, neural network architectures that are able to generalize in\nhuman-like fashion without any of the aforementioned requirements:\nstack-augmented neural networks. We test three base architectures (transformer,\nsimple RNN, LSTM) augmented with two styles of stack: the superposition stack\nof Joulin & Mikolov (2015) and a nondeterministic generalization of it proposed\nby DuSell & Chiang (2023). We find that transformers with nondeterministic\nstacks generalize best out of these architectures on a classical question\nformation task.

Using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline, we obtain 13k\nannotated reference expressions with reliability estimates and analyze the\nresulting understanding states. The results show that full misunderstandings\nare rare once lexical variants are unified, but multiplicity discrepancies\nsystematically induce divergences, revealing how apparent grounding can mask\nreferential misalignment.

Despite growing emphasis on\ndata-centric AI, most datasets are still gathered in an open-loop manner which\naccumulates redundant samples without feedback from the current coverage. This\nresults in inefficient storage, costly labeling, and limited generalization. To\naddress this, this paper introduces \\ac{FCDC}, a paradigm that formulates data\ncollection as a closed-loop control problem. \\ac{FCDC} continuously\napproximates the state of the collected data distribution using an online\nprobabilistic model and adaptively regulates sample retention using based on\nfeedback signals such as likelihood and Mahalanobis distance. Through this\nfeedback mechanism, the system dynamically balances exploration and\nexploitation, maintains dataset diversity, and prevents redundancy from\naccumulating over time. Besides showcasing the controllability of \\ac{FCDC} on\na synthetic dataset, experiments on a real data stream show that \\ac{FCDC}\nproduces more balanced datasets by $\\SI{25.9}{\\percent}$ while reducing data\nstorage by $\\SI{39.8}{\\percent}$.
