While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown\nremarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to\ndiscriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically\ninvestigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard\nplanes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar\n(TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical\nchallenge for reliable biometric assessment.\n  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available\nfetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified\nmulticenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated\nimages from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a\nself-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations.

This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for\nSLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning\n(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL\napproaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense\nframe-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point\ntrajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.\n  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly\naccessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to\ngenerate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with\nground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our\nevaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a\nmean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.\n  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation\nwith our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean\ndifference (95\\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).\nIncorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of\nthe models in quantifying abnormal deformation.

FedAttn enables participants to perform local\nself-attention over their own token representations while periodically\nexchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer\nblocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private\nprompts.

In the past, most\nprevious color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.\nThe purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color\ncorrection algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating\nthe overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and\nthen adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close\nproximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,\nnamely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated\noverlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target\npoints in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method\nis proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the\nhistogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a\nhistogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,\nwe discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our\nalgorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm\nhas been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Because\npublicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches\nrecast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these\ndatasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain\ndifferences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,\nor generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,\ncontent loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object\ndetection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite\nimages, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and\nintra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based\nnode-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization\nperformance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that\nour approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and\ngeneralizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,\nsuch as infrared-visible image matching.

We\nintroduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code\ngeneration: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic\nmeaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general\ncommonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric\nperception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel\nevaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered\nSVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation.

To reflect realistic MPI conditions, the system matrix is\ndegraded using a dual-stage downsampling strategy.

To address this challenge, we introduce HAGI++ - a\nmulti-modal diffusion-based approach for gaze data imputation that, for the\nfirst time, uses the integrated head orientation sensors to exploit the\ninherent correlation between head and eye movements. HAGI++ employs a\ntransformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye\nand head representations and can be readily extended to incorporate additional\nbody movements.
