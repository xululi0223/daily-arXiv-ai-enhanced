Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based\nobjectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and\nconsequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are\ndisproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with\n<UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and\nfinancial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To\nremedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of\nthe widely-used BPE algorithm.

To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens\nas a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for\nalignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit\nthat modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and\nloss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical\nreference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not\nrequire fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective\nimage datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye\nimages, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We\nevaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where\nwe consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of\ntokens for both.

In this study, we employ a Vision\nTransformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional\nperspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context\nin the early layers of a deep neural network.

By\norchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system\nsupports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle\ncomplex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM\nChallenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning\nperformance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves\nsubstantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,\noutperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the\nmulti-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task."}

Moreover, update selection in\ncentralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be\nunreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and\noffer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized,\npeer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework.
