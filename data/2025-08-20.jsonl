Implicit Memory: Exploring Multi-hop Complex Reasoning Over Personalized Information", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "comment": "15 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables", "summary": "In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability\nfor achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.\nAlthough some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user\npersonalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple\nquestion-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require\nmulti-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses\nsignificant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this\nlimitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how\ndifferent memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized\ninformation. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with\na unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and\nimplicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate\ntheir performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their\nstrengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine\nboth paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive\nexperiments.

To address these issues, we\npropose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to\nattack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the\nwidely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into\nfine-grained visual features.

A key challenge lies in establishing function-level\ncorrespondences, considering the significant geometric variations among\nfunctionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function variations. To\naddress this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes\nfunctional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local\ncoordinate frame constructed with keypoint-based abstraction, for imitating\ntool manipulation skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively\nenables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to\nmanipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks.

Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this\nchallenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate\nstructured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,\nhighlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward\nstructured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in\nSFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured\nReinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially\nbreaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,\ncontaining 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate\nsimplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art\nperformance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a\nplateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method\nleverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual\nand visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate\nfine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess\nstructural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an\nevaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training\nstability.

As standard automation solutions\ntend to fall short, SMEs resort to repetitive manual labour impacting\nproduction costs and leading to tech-skilled workforces not being used to their\nfull potential. The COOCK+ ROBUST project aims to transform cobots into mobile\nand reconfigurable production assistants by integrating existing technologies,\nincluding 3D object recognition and localisation. This article explores both\nthe opportunities and challenges of enhancing cobotic systems with these\ntechnologies in an industrial setting, outlining the key steps involved in the\nprocess. Additionally, insights from a past project, carried out by the ACRO\nresearch unit in collaboration with an industrial partner, serves as a concrete\nimplementation example throughout."}

However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes\npre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Continual\nlearning offers a solution by fine-tuning a model sequentially on different\ndomains or tasks, enabling it to integrate new knowledge without requiring\nlarge datasets for each training phase. In this paper, we propose UNIfied\nCONtinual Learning for Medical Foundational Models (UNICON), a framework that\nenables the seamless adaptation of foundation models to diverse domains, tasks,\nand modalities. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat these changes\nin isolation, UNICON provides a unified, perpetually expandable framework.\nThrough careful integration, we show that foundation models can dynamically\nexpand across imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and clinical objectives\nwithout catastrophic forgetting or task interference. Empirically, we validate\nour approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for\nclassification to a prognosis and segmentation task. Our results show improved\nperformance across both additional tasks. Furthermore, we continually\nincorporated PET scans and achieved a 5\\% improvement in Dice score compared to\nrespective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models are not\ninherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve, paving\nthe way toward generalist AI models for medical imaging."}
