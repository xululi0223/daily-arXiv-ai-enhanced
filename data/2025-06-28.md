### [1] [Towards Probabilistic Question Answering Over Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20747)
*Chen Shen,Sajjadur Rahman,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了LUCARIO基准和框架，用于处理表格数据的概率性问答，结合贝叶斯网络和大型语言模型，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QA系统（如NL2SQL）在事实性问题表现良好，但在概率性问题上表现不足，需要新的方法支持不确定性推理。

Method: 通过从表格中构建贝叶斯网络，将自然语言查询转换为概率查询，并利用大型语言模型生成最终答案。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在基准测试中显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 混合符号-神经推理方法在概率性问答中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Current approaches for question answering (QA) over tabular data, such as
NL2SQL systems, perform well for factual questions where answers are directly
retrieved from tables. However, they fall short on probabilistic questions
requiring reasoning under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new
benchmark LUCARIO and a framework for probabilistic QA over large tabular data.
Our method induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language
queries into probabilistic queries, and uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate final answers. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements
over baselines, highlighting the benefits of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning.

### [2] [Multi-lingual Functional Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20793)
*Victor Ojewale,Inioluwa Deborah Raji,Suresh Venkatasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过创建跨语言功能基准（CL-GSM Symbolic和CL-IFEval）评估多语言大模型的实用性能和鲁棒性，发现静态基准与功能基准之间存在显著性能差异，且模型在不同语言间的鲁棒性差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态多语言基准（如Belebele、M-MMLU和M-GSM）未能充分评估模型的实用性能和鲁棒性，因此需要创建功能基准以更全面地评估多语言能力。

Method: 将现有的英语功能基准模板翻译为五种语言（法语、西班牙语、印地语、阿拉伯语和约鲁巴语），创建跨语言功能基准CL-GSM Symbolic和CL-IFEval。

Result: 静态基准与功能基准之间存在显著性能差异（如M-GSM与CL-GSM Symbolic在英语、法语和西班牙语中性能下降24%、17%和18%），且模型在阿拉伯语和英语中表现最稳定。

Conclusion: 功能基准能更准确地评估多语言模型的实用性能和鲁棒性，且模型在不同语言间的表现差异显著。

Abstract: Multi-lingual competence in large language models is often evaluated via
static data benchmarks such as Belebele, M-MMLU and M-GSM. However, these
evaluations often fail to provide an adequate understanding of the practical
performance and robustness of models across multi-lingual settings. In
response, we create multi-lingual functional benchmarks -- Cross-Lingual Grade
School Math Symbolic (CL-GSM Symbolic) and Cross-Lingual Instruction-Following
Eval (CL-IFEval)-- by translating existing functional benchmark templates from
English to five additional languages that span the range of resources available
for NLP: French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic and Yoruba. Our results reveal that
some static multi-lingual benchmarks capture functional performance much more
closely than others (i.e. across models, there is a 24%, 17% and 18% decrease
in performance between M-GSM and CL-GSM Symbolic in English, French and Spanish
respectively; similarly there's a 15 - 24% performance drop across languages
between Belebele and CL-IFEval, and only a 0.5% to 3% performance drop between
M-MMLU and CL-IFEval). Similarly, we find that model robustness across
languages varies significantly, with certain languages (eg. Arabic, English)
being the most consistently well performing across evaluation iterations.

### [3] [The Ideation-Execution Gap: Execution Outcomes of LLM-Generated versus Human Research Ideas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20803)
*Chenglei Si,Tatsunori Hashimoto,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管LLM生成的研究想法在创意阶段被认为更具新颖性，但在实际执行后，其效果显著下降，甚至不如人类专家的想法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM生成的研究想法是否能在实际执行后产生更好的研究成果。

Method: 招募43位专家研究人员，随机分配执行LLM或人类专家生成的想法，并撰写4页短论文。所有项目由NLP专家盲审评分。

Result: 执行后，LLM生成想法的评分显著下降，人类专家想法在多项指标上反超。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在生成真正有效的研究想法上存在局限，且缺乏执行结果的评估具有挑战性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the
scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability
to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in
which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert
ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should
also result in better research after being executed. To test whether
AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution
study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,
either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100
hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the
experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP
researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after
execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more
than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,
effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human
ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review
scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is
a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This
ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating
truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas
in the absence of execution outcomes.

### [4] [MultiFinRAG: An Optimized Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework for Financial Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20821)
*Chinmay Gondhalekar,Urjitkumar Patel,Fang-Chun Yeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiFinRAG是一个专为金融QA设计的检索增强生成框架，通过多模态提取和动态上下文切换，显著提升了复杂金融文档问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM和RAG在处理多模态金融文档时存在token限制、布局丢失和跨模态上下文碎片化的问题，MultiFinRAG旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MultiFinRAG通过轻量级多模态LLM提取表格和图像的结构化JSON和文本摘要，结合模态感知相似性阈值进行检索，并采用分层回退策略动态调整上下文。

Result: MultiFinRAG在复杂金融QA任务中比ChatGPT-4o（免费版）准确率高出19个百分点。

Conclusion: MultiFinRAG在有限硬件条件下实现了高效的多模态金融文档问答，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span
hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative
text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such
content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains
traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented
cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation
framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal
extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to
a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both
structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along
with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity
thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically
escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling
cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on
commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy
than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text,
tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.

### [5] [Uncovering Hidden Violent Tendencies in LLMs: A Demographic Analysis via Behavioral Vignettes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20822)
*Quintin Myers,Yanjun Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在暴力内容检测中的表现，发现其表面生成与内部偏好存在差异，且暴力倾向因人口统计特征而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs被提议用于检测和应对在线暴力内容，但其在道德模糊场景中的推理能力尚未充分研究。

Method: 使用经过验证的社会科学工具（VBVQ）评估LLMs，并通过基于身份的提示引入种族、年龄和地理身份的变量。

Result: LLMs的表面文本生成与内部暴力偏好不一致，且暴力倾向与人口统计特征相关，与现有研究相矛盾。

Conclusion: LLMs在暴力内容检测中存在潜在偏见，需进一步研究其道德推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for detecting and
responding to violent content online, yet their ability to reason about morally
ambiguous, real-world scenarios remains underexamined. We present the first
study to evaluate LLMs using a validated social science instrument designed to
measure human response to everyday conflict, namely the Violent Behavior
Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ). To assess potential bias, we introduce
persona-based prompting that varies race, age, and geographic identity within
the United States. Six LLMs developed across different geopolitical and
organizational contexts are evaluated under a unified zero-shot setting. Our
study reveals two key findings: (1) LLMs surface-level text generation often
diverges from their internal preference for violent responses; (2) their
violent tendencies vary across demographics, frequently contradicting
established findings in criminology, social science, and psychology.

### [6] [Decide less, communicate more: On the construct validity of end-to-end fact-checking in medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20876)
*Sebastian Joseph,Lily Chen,Barry Wei,Michael Mackert,Iain J. Marshall,Paul Pu Liang,Ramez Kouzy,Byron C. Wallace,Junyi Jessy Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自动事实核查系统在医学领域的应用挑战，指出当前系统未广泛使用的原因，并建议将其视为交互式沟通问题而非端到端流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于医学决策的高风险性和医学文献的复杂性，公众对自动事实核查系统的需求增长，但现有系统未能满足实际需求。

Method: 通过研究临床专家如何验证社交媒体上的真实医学声明，揭示端到端事实核查在医学领域的根本挑战。

Result: 发现将实际声明与临床试验证据连接困难、声明模糊性及意图不匹配、主观真实性标签等问题。

Conclusion: 建议将事实核查视为交互式沟通问题，而非端到端流程，以更有效应对医学领域的复杂性。

Abstract: Technological progress has led to concrete advancements in tasks that were
regarded as challenging, such as automatic fact-checking. Interest in adopting
these systems for public health and medicine has grown due to the high-stakes
nature of medical decisions and challenges in critically appraising a vast and
diverse medical literature. Evidence-based medicine connects to every
individual, and yet the nature of it is highly technical, rendering the medical
literacy of majority users inadequate to sufficiently navigate the domain. Such
problems with medical communication ripens the ground for end-to-end
fact-checking agents: check a claim against current medical literature and
return with an evidence-backed verdict. And yet, such systems remain largely
unused. To understand this, we present the first study examining how clinical
experts verify real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence.
In searching for this upper-bound, we reveal fundamental challenges in
end-to-end fact-checking when applied to medicine: Difficulties connecting
claims in the wild to scientific evidence in the form of clinical trials;
ambiguities in underspecified claims mixed with mismatched intentions; and
inherently subjective veracity labels. We argue that fact-checking should be
approached and evaluated as an interactive communication problem, rather than
an end-to-end process.

### [7] [Optimising Language Models for Downstream Tasks: A Post-Training Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20917)
*Zhengyan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一系列方法，以更高效和鲁棒地适应语言模型（LMs）到下游任务，包括利用未标注数据的预训练技术、参数高效的微调方法，以及改进的监督微调方法，显著提升了模型的性能和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言模型在NLP中表现出色，但其适应特定任务时存在效率低、易过拟合和计算成本高的问题，限制了其在现实任务中的应用。

Method: 提出了一系列方法：1）从未标注数据中提取任务相关知识的预训练技术；2）参数高效的微调方法；3）改进的监督微调方法；4）新的评估方法和基准测试。

Result: 这些方法显著提升了语言模型的鲁棒性、效率和泛化能力，使其更适应广泛的应用场景。

Conclusion: 这些进展为构建更鲁棒和高效的语言模型迈出了重要一步，推动了人工通用智能的发展。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in NLP, yet
adapting them efficiently and robustly to specific tasks remains challenging.
As their scale and complexity grow, fine-tuning LMs on labelled data often
underutilizes available unlabelled data, leads to overfitting on small
task-specific sets, and imposes significant computational costs. These
limitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world
language tasks.
  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream
applications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant
knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training
technique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,
we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces
memory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also
introduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better
follow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their
performance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation.
Finally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop
spatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more
comprehensively.
  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results
demonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness,
efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of
applications. These advances mark a significant step towards more robust and
efficient LMs, bringing us closer to the goal of artificial general
intelligence.

### [8] [FineWeb2: One Pipeline to Scale Them All -- Adapting Pre-Training Data Processing to Every Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20920)
*Guilherme Penedo,Hynek Kydlíček,Vinko Sabolčec,Bettina Messmer,Negar Foroutan,Amir Hossein Kargaran,Colin Raffel,Martin Jaggi,Leandro Von Werra,Thomas Wolf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动适应多语言的预训练数据集处理流程FineWeb2，通过优化过滤和去重方法，显著提升了非英语语料库的性能，并发布了包含1000多种语言的20TB数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多语言大语言模型（LLM）的训练面临数据过滤和去重流程难以适应多语言的挑战，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了一种基于FineWeb的自动适应多语言的数据集处理流程，并通过九种语言的实验验证其有效性，同时提出了一种基于重复计数和质量的数据集平衡方法。

Result: 实验表明，该流程能生成性能优于现有数据集的非英语语料库，并进一步通过数据集平衡提升性能。最终发布了包含1000多种语言的20TB数据集FineWeb2。

Conclusion: 本文提出的流程和方法显著提升了多语言预训练数据集的性能，为多语言LLM的发展提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Pre-training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) requires vast
amounts of clean and diverse text data. While the open development of large
high-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent
progress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains a challenge, in large
part due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication
pipelines to a large number of languages. In this work, we introduce a new
pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be
automatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our
pipeline design choices on a set of nine diverse languages, guided by a set of
meaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through a novel
selection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our
pipeline can be used to create non-English corpora that produce more performant
models than prior datasets. We additionally introduce a straightforward and
principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both
duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift.
Finally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common
Crawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, a new 20 terabyte (5 billion document)
multilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and
evaluation codebases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KaLM-Embedding-V2是一种多功能紧凑型嵌入模型，通过改进的训练技术和数据，在通用文本嵌入任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升通用文本嵌入任务的性能，同时保持模型紧凑性。

Method: 采用双向Transformer和均值池化生成固定长度嵌入；多阶段训练流程（预训练、微调、参数平均）；引入焦点式重加权机制和在线硬负样本混合策略。

Result: 在MTEB中英文基准测试中显著优于同类模型，并与更大模型竞争。

Conclusion: KaLM-Embedding-V2为紧凑型嵌入模型设定了新标准，性能优异且参数少于1B。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a versatile and compact
embedding model, which achieves impressive performance in general-purpose text
embedding tasks by leveraging superior training techniques and data. Our key
innovations include: (1) To better align the architecture with representation
learning, we remove the causal attention mask and adopt a fully bidirectional
transformer with simple yet effective mean-pooling to produce fixed-length
embeddings; (2) We employ a multi-stage training pipeline: (i) pre-training on
large-scale weakly supervised open-source corpora; (ii) fine-tuning on
high-quality retrieval and non-retrieval datasets; and (iii) model-soup
parameter averaging for robust generalization. Besides, we introduce a
focal-style reweighting mechanism that concentrates learning on difficult
samples and an online hard-negative mixing strategy to continuously enrich hard
negatives without expensive offline mining; (3) We collect over 20 categories
of data for pre-training and 100 categories of data for fine-tuning, to boost
both the performance and generalization of the embedding model. Extensive
evaluations on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Chinese and English
show that our model significantly outperforms others of comparable size, and
competes with 3x, 14x, 18x, and 26x larger embedding models, setting a new
standard for a versatile and compact embedding model with less than 1B
parameters.

### [10] [Can Gradient Descent Simulate Prompting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20989)
*Eric Zhang,Leshem Choshen,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过梯度更新模拟提示效果的方法，提出了一种元训练语言模型的技术，使梯度下降能部分或完全恢复提示模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过参数更新（如微调）模拟提示的效果，以结合两者的优势：参数更新的长期存储成本低和提示的高效性。

Method: 采用基于梯度的元学习方法，利用语言模型自身的提示预测作为目标，无需真实标签，通过梯度下降训练模拟提示效果。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在单次梯度更新后能部分或完全恢复提示模型的性能，包括解决“反转诅咒”任务和问答任务。

Conclusion: 研究表明，适当的初始化下，梯度下降具有强大的表达能力，为长上下文建模和梯度学习泛化能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language
model (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via
fine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model
changes. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more
effective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and
draw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can
models be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper
describes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the
effects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from
gradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as
targets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient
descent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model
performance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and
answering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These
results suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be
surprisingly expressive. Our results suggest new avenues for long-context
modeling and offer insight into the generalization capabilities of
gradient-based learning.

### [11] [SAC: A Framework for Measuring and Inducing Personality Traits in LLMs with Dynamic Intensity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20993)
*Adithya Chittem,Aishna Shrivastava,Sai Tarun Pendela,Jagat Sesh Challa,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种扩展的机器性格清单（MPI），结合16PF模型和特定属性控制（SAC）框架，实现了对LLM性格特征的精细控制和动态调节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM性格模型依赖粗粒度的Big Five框架且缺乏强度控制机制，限制了其表达力和实用性。

Method: 扩展MPI至16PF模型，开发SAC框架，通过形容词语义锚定和五个强度因子动态调节性格特征。

Result: 连续强度调节比二元切换更一致可控，且目标强度变化会系统性影响相关特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM提供了更精细的性格控制，推动了人机交互的进一步发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide
range of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them
to display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this
expectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM
personalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models
face two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which
only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for
controlling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending
the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five
model, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing
expressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured
framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and
dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces
adjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and
leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:
\textit{Frequency}, \textit{Depth}, \textit{Threshold}, \textit{Effort}, and
\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity
as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable
personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe
that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related
traits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize
multi-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in
isolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine
interactions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing
processes, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.

*Jatin Gupta,Akhil Sharma,Saransh Singhania,Mohammad Adnan,Sakshi Deo,Ali Imam Abidi,Keshav Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了CA-Ben，一个用于评估LLMs在金融、法律和定量推理能力的基准测试，测试了六种主流LLMs，发现Claude 3.5 Sonnet和GPT-4o表现最佳，但数值计算和法律解释仍是挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补印度金融背景下LLMs领域特定知识评估的空白。

Method: 使用CA-Ben基准测试，基于ICAI考试数据集，评估六种LLMs在金融、法律和定量推理的表现。

Result: Claude 3.5 Sonnet和GPT-4o表现最佳，数值计算和法律解释存在挑战。

Conclusion: 未来可通过混合推理和检索增强生成方法改进LLMs在定量分析和法律解释方面的能力。

Abstract: Advanced intelligent systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
significantly reshaping financial practices through advancements in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). However, the extent to which these models
effectively capture and apply domain-specific financial knowledge remains
uncertain. Addressing a critical gap in the expansive Indian financial context,
this paper introduces CA-Ben, a Chartered Accountancy benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate the financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. CA-Ben comprises structured question-answer datasets
derived from the rigorous examinations conducted by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (ICAI), spanning foundational, intermediate, and advanced
CA curriculum stages. Six prominent LLMs i.e. GPT 4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1
405B, MISTRAL Large, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Microsoft Phi 4 were evaluated
using standardized protocols. Results indicate variations in performance, with
Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o outperforming others, especially in conceptual and
legal reasoning. Notable challenges emerged in numerical computations and legal
interpretations. The findings emphasize the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs, suggesting future improvements through hybrid reasoning and
retrieval-augmented generation methods, particularly for quantitative analysis
and accurate legal interpretation.

*Chunyuan Yuan,Chong Zhang,Zheng Fang,Ming Pang,Xue Jiang,Changping Peng,Zhangang Lin,Ching Law*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督可扩展的统一框架（SSUF），用于电子商务查询分类任务，通过知识增强、标签增强和结构增强模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子商务查询通常简短且缺乏上下文，现有方法依赖用户点击行为导致问题，且缺乏统一框架。

Method: SSUF框架包含知识增强、标签增强和结构增强模块，模块可插拔。

Result: 离线与在线A/B实验显示SSUF显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: SSUF有效解决了查询分类任务中的信息不足和标签依赖问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Query classification, including multiple subtasks such as intent and category
prediction, is vital to e-commerce applications. E-commerce queries are usually
short and lack context, and the information between labels cannot be used,
resulting in insufficient prior information for modeling. Most existing
industrial query classification methods rely on users' posterior click behavior
to construct training samples, resulting in a Matthew vicious cycle.
Furthermore, the subtasks of query classification lack a unified framework,
leading to low efficiency for algorithm optimization.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework
(SSUF), containing multiple enhanced modules to unify the query classification
tasks. The knowledge-enhanced module uses world knowledge to enhance query
representations and solve the problem of insufficient query information. The
label-enhanced module uses label semantics and semi-supervised signals to
reduce the dependence on posterior labels. The structure-enhanced module
enhances the label representation based on the complex label relations. Each
module is highly pluggable, and input features can be added or removed as
needed according to each subtask. We conduct extensive offline and online A/B
experiments, and the results show that SSUF significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art models.

*Fuqiang Niu,Genan Dai,Yisha Lu,Jiayu Liao,Xiang Li,Hu Huang,Bowen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了MT2-CSD数据集和LLM-CRAN模型，用于多目标多轮对话立场检测，显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统立场检测研究局限于单实例，缺乏真实社交媒体交互动态的数据集，限制了多轮对话立场检测的发展。

Method: 引入MT2-CSD数据集（24,457标注实例）和LLM-CRAN模型，利用大语言模型增强对话理解。

Result: LLM-CRAN在MT2-CSD数据集上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: MT2-CSD和LLM-CRAN为多轮对话立场检测提供了新基准和有效方法。

Abstract: In the realm of contemporary social media, automatic stance detection is
pivotal for opinion mining, as it synthesizes and examines user perspectives on
contentious topics to uncover prevailing trends and sentiments. Traditional
stance detection research often targets individual instances, thereby limiting
its capacity to model multi-party discussions typical in real social media
scenarios. This shortcoming largely stems from the scarcity of datasets that
authentically capture the dynamics of social media interactions, hindering
advancements in conversational stance detection. In this paper, we introduce
MT2-CSD, a comprehensive dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational
stance detection. To the best of our knowledge, MT2-CSD is the largest dataset
available for this purpose, comprising 24,457 annotated instances and
exhibiting the greatest conversational depth, thereby presenting new challenges
for stance detection. To address these challenges, we propose the Large
Language model enhanced Conversational Relational Attention Network (LLM-CRAN),
which exploits the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to improve conversational
understanding. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of
LLM-CRAN on the MT2-CSD dataset. The experimental results indicate that
LLM-CRAN significantly outperforms strong baseline models in the task of
conversational stance detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DALR提出了一种双层次对齐学习方法，通过细粒度跨模态对齐和全局模态内对齐学习，解决了跨模态偏差和模态内语义分歧问题，显著提升了句子表示质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在粗粒度上对齐图像和文本，面临跨模态偏差和模态内语义分歧的挑战，影响了句子表示的质量。

Method: DALR通过一致性学习模块软化负样本并利用辅助任务的语义相似性实现细粒度跨模态对齐，同时结合排名蒸馏和全局模态内对齐学习捕捉复杂句子关系。

Result: 在语义文本相似性（STS）和迁移（TR）任务上的实验表明，DALR优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: DALR通过双层次对齐学习有效提升了多模态句子表示的质量，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Previous multimodal sentence representation learning methods have achieved
impressive performance. However, most approaches focus on aligning images and
text at a coarse level, facing two critical challenges:cross-modal misalignment
bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, which significantly degrade sentence
representation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DALR
(Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For
cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens
negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to
achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that
sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a
more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and
enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global
intra-modal alignment learning. Comprehensive experiments on semantic textual
similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks validate the effectiveness of our
approach, consistently demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art
baselines.

Motivation: 社区问答平台是重要的知识库，但现有方法未能充分利用外部知识或动态历史上下文，且缺乏适合工业部署的记忆机制。

Method: 提出ComRAG框架，结合静态知识和动态历史问答对，采用基于质心的记忆机制进行检索、生成和高效存储。

Result: 在三个工业CQA数据集上，ComRAG在向量相似度上提升25.9%，延迟降低8.7%至23.3%，存储块增长率从20.23%降至2.06%。

Conclusion: ComRAG在工业CQA中表现出色，显著优于现有方法，适用于实时高效的知识利用。

Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms can be deemed as important
knowledge bases in community, but effectively leveraging historical
interactions and domain knowledge in real-time remains a challenge. Existing
methods often underutilize external knowledge, fail to incorporate dynamic
historical QA context, or lack memory mechanisms suited for industrial
deployment. We propose ComRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for
real-time industrial CQA that integrates static knowledge with dynamic
historical QA pairs via a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for
retrieval, generation, and efficient storage. Evaluated on three industrial CQA
datasets, ComRAG consistently outperforms all baselines--achieving up to 25.9%
improvement in vector similarity, reducing latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and
lowering chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06% over iterations.

TL;DR: Progtuning是一种结合渐进学习的微调框架，通过逐步减少更新的Transformer块数量，优化资源分配并减少约25%的参数更新，同时保持性能。


<details>

Motivation: 随着模型规模增大，全参数微调成本高昂，现有参数高效微调方法未考虑Transformer块贡献不均，导致资源分配低效。

Method: 提出Progtuning框架，基于贡献逐步减少更新的Transformer块数量。

Result: 减少约25%的参数更新，资源分配更高效，性能仍具竞争力，且与参数高效微调方法兼容性高。

Conclusion: Progtuning在优化资源分配和减少参数更新的同时，保持了性能，适用于多种适应场景。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is a promising technique for leveraging Transformer-based
language models in downstream tasks. As model sizes continue to grow, updating
all model parameters becomes increasingly costly. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods effectively address this issue by selectively updating a
small subset of parameters. However, fine-tuning and most existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods require updating the same number of
parameters as the initial size, ignoring the unequal contribution across
Transformer blocks and leading to extremely inefficient allocation of computing
resources. In this paper, we propose Progtuning, the novel fine-tuning
framework combined with progressive learning for Transformer-based language
models. Specifically, Progtuning progressively reduces the number of updated
transformer blocks based on the contribution. Remarkably, Progtuning optimizes
resource allocation and reduces the number of updated parameters by
approximately 25\%, while still maintaining competitive performance. And it
also exhibits high adaptability with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods,
demonstrating excellent performance across various adaptation scenarios.

TL;DR: Cosmos是一种新型文本生成方法，通过压缩的潜在空间实现并行生成，解决了自回归模型的慢速和全局一致性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型在文本生成中存在解码速度慢和全局一致性差的问题，扩散模型虽提供并行生成能力，但受限于高维标记表示。

Method: Cosmos在压缩的潜在空间中运行，通过自编码器学习标记级重建和语义对齐，支持基于扰动的增强。

Result: 实验表明，Cosmos在压缩8倍的情况下保持生成质量，且潜在序列长度增加时超越基线模型。

Conclusion: Cosmos在多种生成任务中表现优异，生成质量相当或更优，推理速度快2倍以上。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models dominate modern text generation, yet their
sequential nature introduces fundamental limitations: decoding is slow, and
maintaining global coherence remains challenging. Diffusion models offer a
promising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control;
however, their application to text generation is hindered by the high
dimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel
approach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth
latent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using
an autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and
alignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing
robust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based
augmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be
compressed by $8\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to
token-level diffusion models. Furthermore, increasing the latent sequence
length allows Cosmos to surpass both diffusion-based and autoregressive
baselines. We evaluate Cosmos on four diverse generative tasks including story
generation, question generation, summarization, and detoxification and compare
it with various generative paradigms. Cosmos achieves comparable or superior
generation quality while offering more than $2\times$ faster inference.

Motivation: 现有对话系统中的轮换预测模型缺乏动态控制能力，无法根据对话伙伴和上下文灵活调整。

Method: 基于Transformer的语音活动预测模型，引入文本提示嵌入到通道和跨通道Transformer中，利用LLM生成合成提示数据。

Result: 在950小时的人-人对话数据上验证，模型提高了预测准确性，并能根据文本提示动态调整轮换时机。

Conclusion: 提出的模型通过文本提示实现了动态控制，为对话系统提供了更灵活和直观的轮换预测能力。

Abstract: Turn-taking prediction models are essential components in spoken dialogue
systems and conversational robots. Recent approaches leverage transformer-based
architectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this
study, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be
dynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and
explicit control through instructions such as "faster" or "calmer" adapting
dynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds
upon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating
textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a
cross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using
over 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data
for the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a
large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences. Experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed model improved prediction accuracy and
effectively varied turn-taking timing behaviors according to the textual
prompts.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在自动术语提取（ATE）中的潜力，现有研究较少关注其应用。

Method: 采用基于检索的提示策略，通过句法相似性选择演示，方法具有领域无关性。

Result: 在三个专业ATE基准测试中，句法检索提高了F1分数。

Conclusion: 句法线索在适应LLMs进行术语提取任务中具有重要性。

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) identifies domain-specific expressions that
are crucial for downstream tasks such as machine translation and information
retrieval. Although large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
various NLP tasks, their potential for ATE has scarcely been examined. We
propose a retrieval-based prompting strategy that, in the few-shot setting,
selects demonstrations according to \emph{syntactic} rather than semantic
similarity. This syntactic retrieval method is domain-agnostic and provides
more reliable guidance for capturing term boundaries. We evaluate the approach
in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, analyzing how lexical overlap
between the query sentence and its retrieved examples affects performance.
Experiments on three specialized ATE benchmarks show that syntactic retrieval
improves F1-score. These findings highlight the importance of syntactic cues
when adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks.

Method: 设计了包含多维度评估、步级奖励评估和高质量数据集的Agent-RewardBench基准。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的多模态模型在奖励建模方面表现有限，需要专门训练。

Conclusion: Agent-RewardBench为代理奖励建模提供了有效的评估工具，并揭示了现有模型的不足。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show
promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence.
However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents
struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to
use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select
reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench
targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The
benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and
real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and
safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the
assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a
more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3)
Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse
models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification
to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the
need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型生成的假文本检测是否会在模型规模不断增长的情况下达到一个平缓期。

Method: 通过统计分类器检测古典侦探小说风格的假文本，比较不同模型（如Gemini和GPT）的欺骗能力变化。

Result: Gemini在0.5版本升级后欺骗能力增强，而GPT未表现出类似变化，表明假文本检测仍可能保持可行性。

Conclusion: 尽管新模型架构可能提升欺骗性，但可靠检测假文本仍可能持续可行。

Abstract: Large language models can produce convincing "fake text" in domains such as
academic writing, product reviews, and political news. Many approaches have
been investigated for the detection of artificially generated text. While this
may seem to presage an endless "arms race", we note that newer LLMs use ever
more parameters, training data, and energy, while relatively simple classifiers
demonstrate a good level of detection accuracy with modest resources. To
approach the question of whether the models' ability to beat the detectors may
therefore reach a plateau, we examine the ability of statistical classifiers to
identify "fake text" in the style of classical detective fiction. Over a 0.5
version increase, we found that Gemini showed an increased ability to generate
deceptive text, while GPT did not. This suggests that reliable detection of
fake text may remain feasible even for ever-larger models, though new model
architectures may improve their deceptiveness

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢思考LLMs在生成批判性反馈和优化解决方案方面能力有限，需要一种方法增强其推理能力。

Method: 引入Double-Checker框架，通过1,730个自我批判实例微调LLMs，使其在推理过程中迭代优化输出。

Result: Double-Checker将AIME基准的pass@1性能从4.4%提升至18.2%。

Conclusion: Double-Checker为开发更具信任感和有效性的LLMs提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like
reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate
informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this
paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit
self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By
fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker
empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during
inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated
critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive
suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique
significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably,
our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME
benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These
results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and
effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

Motivation: LLMs在缺乏上下文信息时容易产生不可靠的回答，因此需要一种机制确保回答的基于性。

Method: 使用RoBERTa和NomicBERT等轻量级编码器模型，通过微调数据集进行训练。

Result: 这些模型在基于性检测上的准确性与Llama3 8B和GPT4o相当，同时显著降低推理延迟。

Conclusion: 轻量级模型可以有效检测基于性，提升LLMs的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly
improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks
information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge.
Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is
essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study
focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided
in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection
mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource
consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as
RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in
groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

Motivation: 研究语言上下文是否足以检测视觉对话中具有视觉指涉的提及，并探索仅文本方法的有效性。

Method: 采用预训练的大型语言模型（LLM），通过下一个词预测对对话中的提及范围进行粗粒度标注。

Result: 实验表明，即使使用中等规模的LLM和小数据集，仅文本方法也能有效完成任务，突显语言上下文的重要性。

Conclusion: 尽管仅文本方法有效，但任务本质是多模态的，单模态方法存在根本性限制。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of a text-only, autoregressive language
modeling approach for the extraction of referring expressions from visually
grounded dialogue. More specifically, the aim is to investigate the extent to
which the linguistic context alone can inform the detection of mentions that
have a (visually perceivable) referent in the visual context of the
conversation. To this end, we adapt a pretrained large language model (LLM) to
perform a relatively course-grained annotation of mention spans in unfolding
conversations by demarcating mention span boundaries in text via next-token
prediction. Our findings indicate that even when using a moderately sized LLM,
relatively small datasets, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, a text-only
approach can be effective, highlighting the relative importance of the
linguistic context for this task. Nevertheless, we argue that the task
represents an inherently multimodal problem and discuss limitations fundamental
to unimodal approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in understanding and generating text but
struggle with providing professional literary criticism for works with profound
thoughts and complex narratives. This paper proposes GLASS (Greimas Literary
Analysis via Semiotic Square), a structured analytical framework based on
Greimas Semiotic Square (GSS), to enhance LLMs' ability to conduct in-depth
literary analysis. GLASS facilitates the rapid dissection of narrative
structures and deep meanings in narrative works. We propose the first dataset
for GSS-based literary criticism, featuring detailed analyses of 48 works. Then
we propose quantitative metrics for GSS-based literary criticism using the
LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. Our framework's results, compared with expert
criticism across multiple works and LLMs, show high performance. Finally, we
applied GLASS to 39 classic works, producing original and high-quality analyses
that address existing research gaps. This research provides an AI-based tool
for literary research and education, offering insights into the cognitive
mechanisms underlying literary engagement.

Motivation: 现实中的RAG系统在处理噪声多、模糊且多意图的用户查询时表现不佳，现有系统通常基于较干净的数据训练或评估，无法满足实际需求。

Result: Omni-RAG能够有效处理噪声和多意图查询，提升RAG系统在开放域环境中的性能。

Conclusion: Omni-RAG通过多模块设计填补了当前RAG能力与实际需求之间的差距，适用于复杂和噪声查询场景。

Abstract: Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant
challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and
contain multiple intents. While RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) with
external knowledge, current systems typically struggle with such complex
inputs, as they are often trained or evaluated on cleaner data. This paper
introduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and
effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs
LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key
modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs
with tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and
decompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware
Knowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus
(i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking
and Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before
a final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a
chain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG
capabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those
highlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex
and noisy queries.

Motivation: 动态平台上语言模式的演化和概念漂移使得欺诈对话检测变得困难，现有LLM在风险敏感场景中表现不佳。

Method: 框架包含三个模块：DK-LLM检测欺诈对话，OCDD检测语义漂移，第二个DK-LLM分类漂移性质。

Result: 在SEConvo数据集上，系统实现了98%的分类准确率，显著优于零样本基线。

Conclusion: 结合领域知识和漂移检测显著提升了高风险NLP应用的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Detecting deceptive conversations on dynamic platforms is increasingly
difficult due to evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD)-i.e.,
semantic or topical shifts that alter the context or intent of interactions
over time. These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue,
making accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with
contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk-sensitive scenarios. To address
these challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)-Enhanced LLM framework
that integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task-specific insights to
perform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed architecture consists
of three main components: (1) a DK-LLM module to detect fake or deceptive
conversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine whether a
semantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK-LLM module to classify the
drift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value of domain
knowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full framework to
SEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types of fraud and
spam attacks. Results show that our system detects fake conversations with high
accuracy and effectively classifies the nature of drift. Guided by structured
prompts, the LLaMA-based implementation achieves 98% classification accuracy.
Comparative studies against zero-shot baselines demonstrate that incorporating
domain knowledge and drift awareness significantly improves performance,
interpretability, and robustness in high-stakes NLP applications.

interfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as
Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database
accessibility, most research today focuses solely on English, with limited
evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of
foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create
and release a multilingual test set by translating English questions into
Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair
cross-lingual comparison. We evaluate multiple foundational models using
standardized prompts and metrics. Our results show a consistent performance
pattern: highest on English, then Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute
this to differences in training data availability and linguistic
characteristics. Additionally, we explore the impact of translating task
prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in
evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Our
findings highlight the need for more inclusive evaluation and development in
multilingual query generation. Future work includes schema localization and
fine-tuning across diverse languages.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的偏好对齐框架，用于通过用户交互改进实时对话模型，解决了现有方法在实时语音交互中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好学习方法主要针对文本语言模型，无法直接适应实时语音交互的复杂性（如打断、插话等）。

Method: 构建了一个包含15万对偏好标注的大规模数据集，利用离线对齐方法微调全双工自回归语音模型。

Result: 实验表明，通用对话的反馈能显著提升模型的事实性、安全性和上下文对齐性。

Conclusion: 研究发现，动态平衡对自然实时语音对话系统至关重要。

Abstract: We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken
dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current
preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and
are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions,
with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit
segmentation between speaker turns.We create a large-scale dataset of more than
150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated
with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and
temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune
a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently
effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer
and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and
conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn
conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated
balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的Transformer架构，通过引入TopK激活函数，解决了稀疏自编码器（SAE）在语言模型解释性中的局限性，无需后训练即可提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器（SAE）在分析Transformer语言模型时存在局限性，如后训练不确定性和特征不稳定性，影响了其有效性和内部效度。

Method: 在Transformer架构中引入TopK激活函数，使隐藏状态直接等效于TopK SAE的潜在特征，无需后训练。

Result: TopK语言模型在模型大小、计算效率和可解释性之间取得了良好平衡，同时保持了原始能力，并支持神经元干预和跨检查点分析。

Conclusion: TopK语言模型为语言模型的学习和概念表示提供了稳定可靠的工具，有望推动模型可解释性和可控性的研究。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become an important tool for analyzing and
interpreting the activation space of transformer-based language models (LMs).
However, SAEs suffer several shortcomings that diminish their utility and
internal validity. Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the
failure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due
to the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated
by training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE
learns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of
feature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across
different checkpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce a
modification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK
activation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states
equivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the
need for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.
The resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,
computational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple
architectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while
providing robust interpretability benefits. Our experiments demonstrate that
the sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering
through targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of
neuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers. These features make
TopK LMs stable and reliable tools for understanding how language models learn
and represent concepts, which we believe will significantly advance future
research on model interpretability and controllability.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning methods for
finetuning large language models when transitioning from offline to semi-online
to fully online regimes for both verifiable and non-verifiable tasks. Our
experiments cover training on verifiable math as well as non-verifiable
instruction following with a set of benchmark evaluations for both. Across
these settings, we extensively compare online and semi-online Direct Preference
Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization objectives, and surprisingly
find similar performance and convergence between these variants, which all
strongly outperform offline methods. We provide a detailed analysis of the
training dynamics and hyperparameter selection strategies to achieve optimal
results. Finally, we show that multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable
rewards jointly yields improved performance across both task types.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过未来对话信号优化交互式LLM以提升用户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能明确关联知识或对话行为与用户参与度，需更直接指标。

Method: 利用用户反应作为奖励信号，结合i×MCTS模拟交互并收集数据，采用DPO优化模型。

Result: 在情感支持和劝导对话中，方法显著提升用户参与度。

Conclusion: 直接优化用户反应信号能有效增强交互式LLM的用户参与度。

Abstract: Enhancing user engagement through interactions plays an essential role in
socially-driven dialogues. While prior works have optimized models to reason
over relevant knowledge or plan a dialogue act flow, the relationship between
user engagement and knowledge or dialogue acts is subtle and does not guarantee
user engagement in socially-driven dialogues. To this end, we enable
interactive LLMs to learn user engagement by leveraging signals from the future
development of conversations. Specifically, we adopt a more direct and relevant
indicator of user engagement, i.e., the user's reaction related to dialogue
intention after the interaction, as a reward to align interactive LLMs. To
achieve this, we develop a user simulator to interact with target interactive
LLMs and explore interactions between the user and the interactive LLM system
via \textit{i$\times$MCTS} (\textit{M}onte \textit{C}arlo \textit{T}ree
\textit{S}earch for \textit{i}nteraction). In this way, we collect a dataset
containing pairs of higher and lower-quality experiences using
\textit{i$\times$MCTS}, and align interactive LLMs for high-level user
engagement by direct preference optimization (DPO) accordingly. Experiments
conducted on two socially-driven dialogue scenarios (emotional support
conversations and persuasion for good) demonstrate that our method effectively
enhances user engagement in interactive LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试常用于评估LLMs，但测试结果是否能真实反映模型的理解能力尚不明确。论文旨在验证这些测试的有效性。

Method: 提出两种量化方法：一种使用专门设计的基准测试，另一种提供普遍性的下限估计。

Result: 研究发现“Potemkin理解”在模型、任务和领域中普遍存在，且反映了概念表征的内部不一致性。

Conclusion: 基准测试可能无法真实反映LLMs的理解能力，需更深入的方法评估其内部一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark
datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities
based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces
a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the
benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test
people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid
tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human
misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin
understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable
with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for
quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed
benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a
lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across
models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just
incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept
representations.

Abstract: People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language
models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of
these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter
large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated

HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs
when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user
interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals
insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as
common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and
interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring
the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs
deployed as conversational AI. Code and artifacts to retrieve our analyses and

Motivation: 现有研究多关注数据效率（如数据筛选和采样），而数据组织优化（数据效能）尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出DELT范式，包括数据评分（如LQS）、数据选择和数据排序（如FO）。

Result: 实验表明DELT能提升模型性能，LQS与FO组合效果最佳，且数据效能与数据效率可结合。

Conclusion: 数据效能是语言模型训练中具有潜力的基础研究方向。

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OTSurv是一种基于最优传输的多实例学习框架，用于全切片图像的生存预测，通过全局和局部约束显式建模病理异质性，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法未能显式捕捉全切片图像中的病理异质性（全局长尾分布和局部预测不确定性），限制了生存预测的准确性。

Method: OTSurv将生存预测建模为最优传输问题，引入全局长尾约束和局部不确定性约束，并通过不平衡最优传输求解。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，OTSurv的平均C-index绝对提升3.6%，并在对数秩检验中具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: OTSurv是一种高效且可解释的生存预测工具，适用于数字病理学。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a
multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often
fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both
globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally
through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a
principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal
distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel
MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv
formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two
constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological
distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by
regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware
constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by
progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT
problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that
can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.
Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular
benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In
addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers
high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in
digital pathology. Our codes are available at

TL;DR: StereoDiff结合立体匹配和视频深度扩散，通过两阶段方法提升视频深度估计的一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频深度估计不是图像深度估计的简单扩展，静态和动态区域的时序一致性需求不同。

Method: StereoDiff采用两阶段方法：静态区域通过立体匹配，动态区域通过视频深度扩散。

Result: 在零样本和真实世界动态视频深度基准测试中表现最优。

Conclusion: StereoDiff通过互补方法显著提升了视频深度估计的性能。

Abstract: Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following
the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained
video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth
estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal
consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are
fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically
backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all
frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for
dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to
ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.
Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth
estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with
video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic
areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth
diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,
highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of
both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth
benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance,
showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

Motivation: 视觉和触觉是机器人感知和操作任务的互补信息源，但现有方法在模态融合时特征整合效果不佳。

Method: 提出ConViTac网络，采用对比嵌入条件（CEC）机制，通过自监督对比学习预训练的编码器生成统一潜在嵌入，并利用跨模态注意力对齐特征。

Result: 实验表明，ConViTac在材料分类和抓取预测任务中准确率提升高达12.0%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ConViTac通过对比表征和跨模态注意力有效提升了视觉-触觉特征融合的性能。

Abstract: Vision and touch are two fundamental sensory modalities for robots, offering
complementary information that enhances perception and manipulation tasks.
Previous research has attempted to jointly learn visual-tactile representations
to extract more meaningful information. However, these approaches often rely on
direct combination, such as feature addition and concatenation, for modality
fusion, which tend to result in poor feature integration. In this paper, we
propose ConViTac, a visual-tactile representation learning network designed to
enhance the alignment of features during fusion using contrastive
representations. Our key contribution is a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning
(CEC) mechanism that leverages a contrastive encoder pretrained through
self-supervised contrastive learning to project visual and tactile inputs into
unified latent embeddings. These embeddings are used to couple visual-tactile
feature fusion through cross-modal attention, aiming at aligning the unified
representations and enhancing performance on downstream tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of ConViTac in real world
over current state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of our proposed CEC
mechanism, which improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification
and grasping prediction tasks.

Method: 使用SAM、SAM 2、MedSAM、SAM-Med-3D和nnU-Net在BraTS 2023数据集上进行零样本推理，并比较不同提示质量（点和边界框）下的性能。还对部分模型进行了微调。

Result: SAM和SAM 2在精确边界框提示下Dice分数高达0.894和0.893，优于nnU-Net，但nnU-Net仍因实用性占优。微调后点提示性能显著提升，但仍不及边界框或nnU-Net。

Conclusion: 精确提示下某些模型表现优异，但nnU-Net仍是医学图像分割的最佳选择。微调显示未来潜力，但需进一步研究。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has greatly aided medical diagnosis, with U-Net
based architectures and nnU-Net providing state-of-the-art performance. There
have been numerous general promptable models and medical variations introduced
in recent years, but there is currently a lack of evaluation and comparison of
these models across a variety of prompt qualities on a common medical dataset.
This research uses Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM
2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net to obtain zero-shot inference on the BraTS
2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset across multiple prompt qualities for
both points and bounding boxes. Several of these models exhibit promising Dice
scores, particularly SAM and SAM 2 achieving scores of up to 0.894 and 0.893,
respectively when given extremely accurate bounding box prompts which exceeds
nnU-Net's segmentation performance. However, nnU-Net remains the dominant
medical image segmentation network due to the impracticality of providing
highly accurate prompts to the models. The model and prompt evaluation, as well
as the comparison, are extended through fine-tuning SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and
SAM-Med-3D on the pediatrics dataset. The improvements in point prompt
performance after fine-tuning are substantial and show promise for future
investigation, but are unable to achieve better segmentation than bounding
boxes or nnU-Net.

Motivation: 在嘈杂环境中，手势识别对非人机交互至关重要，传统方法依赖任务特定架构，而VFMs和VLMs的泛化能力可能简化系统。

Method: 比较了V-JEPA（VFM）、Gemini Flash 2.0（VLM）和HD-GCN（骨架方法）在NUGGET数据集上的表现。

Result: HD-GCN表现最佳，V-JEPA接近，Gemini在零样本设置中表现不佳。

Conclusion: V-JEPA有望作为共享多任务模型简化系统，但需进一步研究手势的输入表示。

Abstract: Gestures enable non-verbal human-robot communication, especially in noisy
environments like agile production. Traditional deep learning-based gesture
recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or
skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)
and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities
offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated
task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for
dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art
VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing
skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for
human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the
different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves
best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific
classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system
complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini
struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input
representations for gestures.

Motivation: 解决超分辨率问题中回归模型和扩散模型在信息保真度和感知质量之间的权衡问题，确保生成图像的可信度。

Method: 利用VLM（如BLIP-2、GPT-4o）进行语义评估，结合CLIP嵌入、SSIM边缘图和多级小波分解的混合指标（TWS）量化可靠性。

Result: TWS与人类偏好高度相关，VLM引导的选择在模糊和自然图像中均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成SR图像的可信度提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案，并设定了新的可信度基准。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible
solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive
SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single
solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity
in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On
the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but
selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This
paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most
trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic
reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs
such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries
to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The
top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy
output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of
VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid
metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:
semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on
edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.
We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both
ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield
high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail
to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,
and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR
space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness,
this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

*Ha Min Son,Shahbaz Rezaei,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FixCLR是一种新的半监督域泛化方法，通过对比学习显式正则化域不变表示，结合伪标签类别信息，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督域泛化中标签稀缺导致的性能不足问题，现有方法未显式正则化域不变表示。

Method: 引入FixCLR，结合对比学习和伪标签类别信息，仅使用排斥项显式正则化域不变表示。

Result: FixCLR在多种实验中表现优异，尤其是与其他半监督方法结合时。

Conclusion: FixCLR是有效的半监督域泛化方法，适用于多领域数据集，并能与其他方法互补提升性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of
generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available.
Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often
underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised
learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do
not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all
domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we
introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change
two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain
invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels
and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most
existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance
improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been
previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking
different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance
of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many
domains. Overall, FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when
combined with other semi-supervised methods.

### [46] [Vector Contrastive Learning For Pixel-Wise Pretraining In Medical Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20850)
*Yuting He,Shuo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为COVER的向量对比学习框架，解决了传统对比学习在像素级表示中的过分散问题，提升了医学视觉基础模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比学习在像素级表示中存在过分散问题，破坏了像素级特征相关性，影响了医学视觉任务的性能。

Method: 提出向量对比学习（vector CL）框架COVER，将对比学习重新定义为向量回归问题，通过建模特征距离来量化分散，并采用向量金字塔架构适应不同粒度。

Result: 在8个任务、2个维度和4种模态的实验中，COVER显著提升了像素级自监督预训练的性能。

Conclusion: COVER框架有效解决了像素级对比学习的过分散问题，为医学视觉基础模型提供了更强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised
pretraining (SSP) in foundation models, however, extending CL to pixel-wise
representation, crucial for medical vision, remains an open problem. Standard
CL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the
excessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an over-dispersion problem,
breaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class
distribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem,
enabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling
feature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel
paradigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER
establishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent
optimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a
vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving
pixel-wise feature correlations in SSP. Extensive experiments across 8 tasks,
spanning 2 dimensions and 4 modalities, show that COVER significantly improves
pixel-wise SSP, advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.

*Ryosuke Kawamura,Hideaki Hayashi,Shunsuke Otake,Noriko Takemura,Hajime Nagahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIDAS是一种数据增强方法，通过软标签和视频帧的凸组合提升动态面部表情识别（DFER）性能，尤其在处理模糊表情时表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实场景中，模糊面部表情的准确识别对DFER至关重要，但现有方法对此处理不足。

Method: MIDAS通过结合视频帧及其对应的软标签（多情绪类别的概率）来增强训练数据，扩展了mixup方法。

Result: 在DFEW和FERV39k-Plus数据集上的实验显示，MIDAS训练模型优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MIDAS是一种简单高效的数据增强方法，显著提升了DFER在模糊表情上的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is a task that estimates
emotions from facial expression video sequences. For practical applications,
accurately recognizing ambiguous facial expressions -- frequently encountered
in in-the-wild data -- is essential. In this study, we propose MIDAS, a data
augmentation method designed to enhance DFER performance for ambiguous facial
expression data using soft labels representing probabilities of multiple
emotion classes. MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining pairs of
video frames and their corresponding emotion class labels. This approach
extends mixup to soft-labeled video data, offering a simple yet highly
effective method for handling ambiguity in DFER. To evaluate MIDAS, we
conducted experiments on both the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus, a newly
constructed dataset that assigns soft labels to an existing DFER dataset. The
results demonstrate that models trained with MIDAS-augmented data achieve
superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method trained on the
original dataset.

### [48] [THIRDEYE: Cue-Aware Monocular Depth Estimation via Brain-Inspired Multi-Stage Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20877)
*Calin Teodor Ioan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThirdEye是一种单目深度估计方法，通过显式提供视觉线索（如遮挡边界、阴影和透视）并结合预训练网络，利用三阶段皮层层次结构和工作记忆模块优化深度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过隐式学习直接从RGB像素推断深度，忽略了人类视觉系统依赖的显式线索。ThirdEye旨在通过显式提供这些线索改进深度估计。

Method: ThirdEye通过预训练和冻结的专家网络提供视觉线索，利用三阶段皮层层次结构（V1->V2->V3）和工作记忆模块加权融合线索，最终通过自适应分箱变换器生成高分辨率视差图。

Result: 由于冻结了专家网络，ThirdEye继承了大量外部监督，仅需少量微调。具体量化结果将在未来版本中公布。

Conclusion: ThirdEye通过显式利用视觉线索和预训练网络，提供了一种更高效的深度估计方法，减少了训练需求。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation methods traditionally train deep models to infer
depth directly from RGB pixels. This implicit learning often overlooks explicit
monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion
boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to
discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that
deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen
networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3)
equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by
reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution
disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large
amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This
extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific
motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will
appear in a future revision.

Conclusion: 提出的基准和发现为多人生成图像研究提供了标准化工具和见解。

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions,
while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major
factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address
this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously
evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark
comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a
range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a
total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity
across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide
human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We
propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify
face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a
thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches
and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose
novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human
segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our
proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a
standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

Abstract: This work investigates the geometric foundations of modern stereo vision
systems, with a focus on how 3D structure and human-inspired perception
contribute to accurate depth reconstruction. We revisit the Cyclopean Eye model

discontinuities. Our analysis includes the evaluation of stereo feature
matching quality derived from deep learning models, as well as the role of
attention mechanisms in recovering meaningful 3D surfaces. Through both
theoretical insights and empirical studies on real datasets, we demonstrate
that combining strong geometric priors with learned features provides internal
abstractions for understanding stereo vision systems.

TL;DR: 开发了一种名为FaSTA$^*$的高效神经符号代理，用于多轮图像编辑任务，结合了LLM的快速规划和A$^*$搜索的精确工具使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多轮图像编辑任务的高成本问题，通过结合LLM的快速规划和A$^*$搜索的精确性，实现成本效益。

Method: 结合LLM的快速高级规划和A$^*$搜索的局部精确工具使用，通过归纳推理提取常用子程序并复用。

Result: FaSTA$^*$在计算效率上显著优于现有方法，同时保持与最先进基准相当的成功率。

Conclusion: FaSTA$^*$通过自适应快慢规划，显著降低了相似子任务的探索成本，是一种高效且实用的图像编辑代理。

Abstract: We develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging
multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while
recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the
wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large
language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$
search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to
AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive
reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously
extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for
future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level
subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$
search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save
exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images,
yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask
planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted
by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$
search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with
recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more
computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art
baseline in terms of success rate.

Motivation: 当前深度学习方法在像素级伪造定位中存在计算开销大和表征能力有限的问题，尤其是对复杂或细微篡改的处理不足。

Method: M2SFormer在跳跃连接中统一多频率和多尺度注意力，并利用全局先验图指导难度感知注意力模块，以保留细微篡改。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，M2SFormer在伪造检测和定位方面优于现有最先进模型，具有更强的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: M2SFormer通过创新的注意力机制和全局先验图，有效解决了图像伪造定位中的关键挑战，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative
use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based
methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery
localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and
limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In
this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework
designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial
and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and
multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to
better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses
the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a
curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then
guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations
more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models,
offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across
unseen domains.

TL;DR: PhysRig提出了一种基于物理的皮肤绑定框架，解决了传统线性混合皮肤（LBS）的体积损失和变形不自然问题，适用于弹性材料建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LBS方法在模拟弹性材料（如软组织、毛发等）时存在体积损失和变形不自然的缺陷，PhysRig旨在通过物理模拟克服这些限制。

Method: PhysRig将刚性骨架嵌入体积表示（如四面体网格），通过连续力学和粒子离散化实现可微性，并引入材料原型减少学习空间。

Result: PhysRig在合成数据集上表现优于传统LBS方法，生成更真实且物理合理的结果，并在姿态迁移任务中展示了其通用性。

Conclusion: PhysRig为皮肤绑定和动画提供了更物理准确的解决方案，适用于多种弹性材料和复杂运动模式。

Abstract: Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated
object reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and
differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and
unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft
tissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty
tissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based
skinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding
the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh),
which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated
skeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object
as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure
differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion.
Additionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the
learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our
framework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from
Objaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object
categories and motion patterns. Our method consistently outperforms traditional
LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible
results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the
pose transfer task highlighting its versatility for articulated object
modeling.

Result: 在四个数据集（PHOENIX-2014、PHOENIX-2014T、CSL-Daily和Sign Language Gesture）上验证了HST-CSLR的有效性。

Conclusion: HST-CSLR通过结合文本知识和层次化对齐，显著提升了连续手语识别的性能。

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) aims to transcribe untrimmed
videos into glosses, which are typically textual words. Recent studies indicate
that the lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck
for CSLR due to insufficient training data. To address this, some works have
developed cross-modal solutions to align visual and textual modalities.
However, they typically extract textual features from glosses without fully
utilizing their knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical
Sub-action Tree (HST), termed HST-CSLR, to efficiently combine gloss knowledge
with visual representation learning. By incorporating gloss-specific knowledge
from large language models, our approach leverages textual information more
effectively. Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information
representation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and
benefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity.
Additionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap
between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014,
PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our HST-CSLR.

Conclusion: PathChat+和SlideSeek为病理学提供了更强大的多模态分析和自主诊断工具。

Abstract: Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide
imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based
computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models
primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language
instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including
insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image
understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically
designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse,
pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer
turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated
that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as
both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific
models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI
system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide

Conclusion: DFVEdit为Video DiTs提供了一种高效、高质量的零样本视频编辑解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in
video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to
Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to
resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this
problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method
tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention
modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow
transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can
be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this
foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a
theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross
Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further
enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at
least 20x inference speed-up and 85\% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared
to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to
popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art
performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人脸老化方法难以在年龄准确性和身份保留之间取得平衡，尤其是在大年龄跨度或极端头部姿态的情况下。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段通过自适应噪声注入（AdaNI）实现年龄准确性；第二阶段通过身份感知嵌入（IDEmb）增强身份保留。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ测试数据集上，Cradle2Cane在年龄准确性和身份一致性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Cradle2Cane通过两阶段设计有效解决了Age-ID权衡问题，实现了更真实和自然的人脸老化效果。

Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications
ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle
with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire
lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The
core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what
we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age
transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this
work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named
Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first
pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection
(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of
age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by
adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing
more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is
weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second
pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features
by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace
and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the
first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the
aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive
experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL
protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in

Result: 实验表明，该方法在成像退化条件下（如渐晕和污垢）仍能生成高质量的3D场景表示。

Conclusion: 通过联合优化和深度正则化，有效提升了3D场景表示的质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Representing scenes from multi-view images is a crucial task in computer
vision with extensive applications. However, inherent photometric distortions
in the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without
accounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently
incorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the
quality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D
scene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By
introducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full
photometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on
simultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the
proposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D
scene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric
parameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene
representation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the
camera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a
complete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera
photometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of
imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.

*Wenjie Xuan,Jing Zhang,Juhua Liu,Bo Du,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于稀疏信号（如OpenPose）的新型空间姿态控制网络（SP-Ctrl），用于姿态引导的图像生成，解决了密集信号（如深度、DensePose）带来的编辑困难和与文本提示不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集信号在姿态引导的图像生成中存在编辑困难和与文本提示不一致的问题，而稀疏信号因其简单性和形状无关性未被充分探索。

Method: 扩展OpenPose为可学习的空间表示，引入关键点概念学习以增强姿态对齐。

Result: 实验表明，SP-Ctrl在稀疏姿态引导下优于现有方法，甚至媲美基于密集信号的方法，并展示了跨物种生成的潜力。

Conclusion: 稀疏信号在姿态引导的图像生成中具有潜力，SP-Ctrl为这一领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent works favored dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose), as an
alternative to sparse signals (e.g., OpenPose), to provide detailed spatial
guidance for pose-guided text-to-image generation. However, dense
representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and
potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to
revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and
shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel
Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust
controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend
OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings
discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept
learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions
of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and
human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose
guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods.
Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species
generation through sparse signals. Codes will be available at

*Xiao Zhang,Yongqiang Ma,Haodong Jing,Nanning Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出EVA框架，通过多专家模型和语义变体对齐提升组合零样本学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CZSL方法通过简单组合-原型映射学习原始特征，忽略了语义子集和组合差异，导致图像-组合对齐不精细。

Method: 提出EVA框架，包括领域专家适应（多专家模型实现令牌感知学习）和语义变体对齐（选择语义相关表示）。

Result: 在三个流行基准测试中，EVA在封闭和开放世界设置下显著优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: EVA通过多专家和语义对齐有效提升了组合零样本学习的性能。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) investigates compositional
generalization capacity to recognize unknown state-object pairs based on
learned primitive concepts. Existing CZSL methods typically derive primitives
features through a simple composition-prototype mapping, which is suboptimal
for a set of individuals that can be divided into distinct semantic subsets.
Moreover, the all-to-one cross-modal primitives matching neglects compositional
divergence within identical states or objects, limiting fine-grained
image-composition alignment. In this study, we propose EVA, a
Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework for CZSL. Specifically,
we introduce domain-expert adaption, leveraging multiple experts to achieve
token-aware learning and model high-quality primitive representations. To
enable accurate compositional generalization, we further present semantic
variant alignment to select semantically relevant representation for
image-primitives matching. Our method significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three popular benchmarks in both closed- and
open-world settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed insight.

TL;DR: PathSegmentor是一种基于文本提示的病理图像分割基础模型，解决了现有方法在临床应用中因标注数据有限和类别定义狭窄而面临的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理图像分割在癌症诊断和预后分析中至关重要，但现有方法因标注数据不足和类别定义受限而难以广泛应用。

Method: 提出了PathSegmentor模型和PathSeg数据集，前者通过自然语言提示实现语义分割，后者是最大且最全面的病理分割数据集。

Result: PathSegmentor在Dice分数上显著优于现有模型，具有更高的准确性和更广的适用性，同时增强了诊断模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: PathSegmentor推动了精准肿瘤学中可解释AI的发展，为临床决策提供了基于证据的支持。

Abstract: Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for
analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to
limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these
limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation
foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce
PathSeg , the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology
segmentation, built from 17 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label
triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform
semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for
laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher
accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture.
It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145
and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in
segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover,
PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models
through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering
pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work
advances the development of explainable AI in precision oncology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在点级任务（如分割）中表现不佳，主要因缺乏直接的3D-文本对齐，无法有效关联局部3D特征与文本上下文。

Method: TSDASeg采用两阶段模型，结合直接跨模态对齐模块和内存模块。内存模块通过自注意力和跨注意力机制动态更新场景特征。

Result: 在多个3D指令、参考和语义分割数据集上实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: TSDASeg通过直接跨模态对齐和动态内存模块，显著提升了交互式点云分割的效果。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred
significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly
for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in
point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text
alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual
context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled
with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive
point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module
to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image
data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to
separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal
correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through
self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features
based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in
interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments
conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Method: 采用分步视频到音频合成任务，基于目标文本提示和先前生成的音频轨道进行引导生成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能为单个视频生成多个语义不同的音频轨道，合成质量优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法无需专用配对数据集，利用预训练模型，实现了高质量的复合音频合成。

Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that
sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific
sound event in the video. Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows,
aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively.
Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task,
conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This
design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional
generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a
training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and
eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more
accessible data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading
to higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖高分辨率图像或静态几何假设，难以处理动态物体和相机运动导致的模糊问题。

Result: 模型在动态模糊场景下表现出色，为模糊单目视频输入设定了新的基准。

Conclusion: DBMovi-GS方法有效解决了动态模糊场景的新视角合成问题，提升了视觉保真度和稳定性。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis is a task of generating scenes from unseen perspectives;
however, synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos remains an
unresolved challenge that has yet to be effectively addressed. Existing novel
view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on
high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid
scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world
environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and
degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View
Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting
(DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular
videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry
videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic
motion variations. Our model achieves robust performance in novel view
synthesis under dynamic blurry scenes and sets a new benchmark in realistic
novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video inputs.

Motivation: 解决细胞病理学中异常细胞检测因标注质量低、数据分布长尾和染色风格不一致而面临的挑战。

Method: 通过属性指导选择异常细胞库中的候选，利用高频特征重建实现风格对齐的高保真合成，并使用大视觉语言模型筛选高质量合成图像。

Result: 实验表明，SAIC合成的图像显著提升了尾部类别和风格的检测性能和鲁棒性，整体检测性能得到改善。

Conclusion: SAIC在临床应用场景中展现出良好的通用性和实用性，代码将开源。

Abstract: Challenges such as the lack of high-quality annotations, long-tailed data
distributions, and inconsistent staining styles pose significant obstacles to
training neural networks to detect abnormal cells in cytopathology robustly.
This paper proposes a style-aligned image composition (SAIC) method that
composes high-fidelity and style-preserved pathological images to enhance the
effectiveness and robustness of detection models. Without additional training,
SAIC first selects an appropriate candidate from the abnormal cell bank based
on attribute guidance. Then, it employs a high-frequency feature reconstruction
to achieve a style-aligned and high-fidelity composition of abnormal cells and
pathological backgrounds. Finally, it introduces a large vision-language model
to filter high-quality synthesis images. Experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating SAIC-synthesized images effectively enhances the performance and
robustness of abnormal cell detection for tail categories and styles, thereby
improving overall detection performance. The comprehensive quality evaluation
further confirms the generalizability and practicality of SAIC in clinical
application scenarios. Our code will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 场景文本移除（STR）技术可能被滥用，因此需要一种方法检测其使用并定位移除区域，以防范潜在风险。

Method: ISTR通过分析STR处理后的图像，实现二分类（检测是否经过STR）和文本移除区域的定位，并尝试训练文本识别器恢复被移除内容。

Result: 实验表明，ISTR在检测和定位任务中具有高准确率，同时揭示了恢复被移除文本的难度。

Conclusion: ISTR能有效检测STR的潜在滥用，并为改进STR技术提供参考。

Abstract: Scene text removal (STR) aims to erase textual elements from images. It was
originally intended for removing privacy-sensitiveor undesired texts from
natural scene images, but is now also appliedto typographic images. STR
typically detects text regions and theninpaints them. Although STR has advanced
through neural networksand synthetic data, misuse risks have increased. This
paper investi-gates Inverse STR (ISTR), which analyzes STR-processed images
andfocuses on binary classification (detecting whether an image has un-dergone
STR) and localizing removed text regions. We demonstrate inexperiments that
these tasks are achievable with high accuracies, en-abling detection of
potential misuse and improving STR. We also at-tempt to recover the removed
text content by training a text recognizerto understand its difficulty.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 摩托车头盔法规的执行对道路安全至关重要，但自动检测面临环境多变、数据不一致等挑战。

Method: 提出VisionGuard框架，包含自适应标签模块（基于跟踪的标签修正）和上下文扩展模块（生成虚拟边界框）。

Result: 实验显示，VisionGuard比基线检测器mAP提升3.1%。

Conclusion: VisionGuard在交通监控系统中具有实际应用潜力，可提升安全性和法规遵从性。

Abstract: Enforcing helmet regulations among motorcyclists is essential for enhancing
road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of traffic management systems.
However, automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges
due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the
data. These factors hinder reliable detection of motorcycles and riders and
disrupt consistent object classification. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionGuard, a synergistic multi-stage framework designed to overcome
the limitations of frame-wise detectors, especially in scenarios with class
imbalance and inconsistent annotations. VisionGuard integrates two key
components: Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules. The Adaptive
Labeling module is a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances
classification consistency by leveraging a tracking algorithm to assign
persistent labels across frames and correct misclassifications. The Contextual
Expander module improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating
virtual bounding boxes with appropriate confidence scores, effectively
addressing the impact of data imbalance. Experimental results show that
VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors,
demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in
traffic surveillance systems, ultimately promoting safety and regulatory
compliance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前2D标本放射成像（SR）评估术中边缘状态的准确性有限，导致近四分之一的患者需要额外手术。

Method: 结合Segment Anything Model（SAM）和Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning（FFCL），通过预训练ResNet-18分类边缘状态，并利用SAM细化肿瘤边缘分割。

Result: AUC为0.8455，Dice相似性比基线模型提高27.4%，推理时间降至47毫秒/图像。

Conclusion: FFCL-SAM显著提升了术中边缘评估的速度和准确性，有望降低再切除率并改善乳腺癌治疗效果。

Abstract: Complete removal of cancer tumors with a negative specimen margin during
lumpectomy is essential in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, 2D
specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative
specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of
patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep
learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with
Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging
both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR
images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,
non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18
backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary
masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach
achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with
a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing
inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that
FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative
margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and
improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将老化建模为单一确定性路径，无法反映多样化的未来。本文旨在通过多路径老化树实现更真实、可控的老化过程。

Method: 采用无需训练的扩散方法，结合注意力混合和模拟老化正则化策略，平衡身份保持、年龄准确性和条件控制。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，该方法在身份保持、老化真实性和条件对齐方面优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 通过将老化转化为多维、可控且可解释的过程，为数字叙事、健康教育和个性化可视化提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple
plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on
external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior
methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates
an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a
training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age
accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing
to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to
stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and
conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression
models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By
transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable
process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital
storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

Motivation: 现有方法需要用户通过AR显示对齐拍摄图像，任务繁重且场景受限，需改进数据收集方式。

Method: 利用局部重建光场和可视化误差，引导用户插入新视角以减少误差。

Result: 误差峰值可视化侵入性低，减少用户失望，且所需视角样本更少。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于更大场景的辐射场重建，如3D高斯泼溅。

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) provides ways to visualize missing view samples for
novel view synthesis. Existing approaches present 3D annotations for new view
samples and task users with taking images by aligning the AR display. This data
collection task is known to be mentally demanding and limits capture areas to
pre-defined small areas due to the ideal but restrictive underlying sampling
theory. To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we
propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be
removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking
visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is
satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. We
also show that our approach can contribute to recent radiance field
reconstruction for larger scenes, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VQA方法仅提供数值评分，无法全面描述视频质量的复杂维度，限制了其应用。利用语言输出的优势，通过指令调优适应视频LMMs可以解决这一问题。

Method: 提出SIG流程，自动为未标注视频评分并映射到文本级别，结合分层思维链（CoT）建模质量维度与整体质量的关系，生成S2I数据集，并设计渐进式调优策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在S2I-Bench和现有基准测试中显著提升了视频LMMs的质量评分和解释能力。

Conclusion: SIG流程和S2I数据集为视频LMMs的质量评估提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，同时提升了模型的多维质量分析和解释能力。

Abstract: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score
to judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to
describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.
Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models
(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.
The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.
Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data
generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary
systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these
challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.
Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled
video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a
hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific
dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning
process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written
quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and
generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset
contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for
instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and
justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy
to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a
benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the
quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the
S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently
improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video
LMMs.

Result: 实验证明FedSC在多种挑战性场景下有效，且关键组件高效。

Conclusion: FedSC通过语义级协作成功解决了数据异构性问题，并提供了理论收敛保证。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train models collaboratively across clients
without sharing data for privacy-preserving. However, one major challenge is
the data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences
at multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data
heterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g.,
fine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information
contained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client
semantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this
paper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC)
to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous
clients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and
consistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class
underlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise
collaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive
learning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational
prototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other
hand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner,
as a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local
model. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a
convergence guarantee. Experimental results on various challenging scenarios
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease
detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality
data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy
concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical
generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational
resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising
alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield
grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space
fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first
classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating
color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs
and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and
classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the
performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art
classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10
times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for
quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate
the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware
noise.

*Fuyan Ma,Yiran He,Bin Sun,Shutao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MPA-FER的多模态提示对齐框架，用于提升视觉语言模型在面部表情识别任务中的细粒度语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的面部表情识别方法难以捕捉细粒度的文本-视觉关系，无法区分表情的细微差异。

Method: 采用多粒度硬提示生成策略，利用大语言模型生成详细的表情描述，并通过特征差异最小化将外部知识注入软提示。同时，结合原型引导的视觉特征对齐和跨模态全局-局部对齐模块。

Result: 在三个面部表情识别基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时保持了预训练模型的泛化能力并降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: MPA-FER框架通过细粒度语义指导和跨模态对齐，显著提升了面部表情识别的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language
models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success,
current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to
capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for
distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this
challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called
MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process
of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable
representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt
generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to
generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based
external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature
discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the
generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach
incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the
prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with
class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local
alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further
improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained
model and minimizing computational costs.

Conclusion: LASFNet在效率和精度之间取得了良好平衡，代码将开源。

Abstract: Effective deep feature extraction via feature-level fusion is crucial for
multimodal object detection. However, previous studies often involve complex
training processes that integrate modality-specific features by stacking
multiple feature-level fusion units, leading to significant computational
overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new fusion detection baseline
that uses a single feature-level fusion unit to enable high-performance
detection, thereby simplifying the training process. Based on this approach, we
propose a lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network
(LASFNet), which introduces a novel attention-guided self-modulation feature
fusion (ASFF) module that adaptively adjusts the responses of fusion features
at both global and local levels based on attention information from different
modalities, thereby promoting comprehensive and enriched feature generation.
Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is
designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and
minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative
datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach
achieves a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, reducing the number of
parameters and computational cost by as much as 90% and 85%, respectively,
while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3%. The code will be
open-sourced at https://github.com/leileilei2000/LASFNet.

Motivation: 传统图像标记化方法（如VQ-VAEs）需要大量标记，计算成本高。本文旨在通过1D二进制潜在空间减少标记数量，提高效率。

Method: 采用1D二进制向量序列表示图像，取代传统one-hot编码，结合简单模型架构，实现高效训练和推理。

Result: 在1024x1024分辨率图像上仅需128个标记，比标准VQ-VAEs减少32倍标记数量，训练速度显著提升。

Conclusion: 1D二进制潜在空间为图像生成提供了高效、可扩展的替代方案，无需私有数据或后训练优化即可达到现代模型的性能。

Abstract: Image tokenization plays a critical role in reducing the computational
demands of modeling high-resolution images, significantly improving the
efficiency of image and multimodal understanding and generation. Recent
advances in 1D latent spaces have reduced the number of tokens required by
eliminating the need for a 2D grid structure. In this paper, we further advance
compact discrete image representation by introducing 1D binary image latents.
By representing each image as a sequence of binary vectors, rather than using
traditional one-hot codebook tokens, our approach preserves high-resolution
details while maintaining the compactness of 1D latents. To the best of our
knowledge, our text-to-image models are the first to achieve competitive
performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128
discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold
reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. The proposed 1D binary
latent space, coupled with simple model architectures, achieves marked
improvements in speed training and inference speed. Our text-to-image models
allow for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node with 8 AMD MI300X
GPUs, and the training can be completed within 200 GPU days. Our models achieve
competitive performance compared to modern image generation models without any
in-house private training data or post-training refinements, offering a
scalable and efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods.

Motivation: 商用RGB-D相机对非朗伯物体生成的深度图通常噪声大且不完整，传统方法因训练数据多样性不足而泛化能力差。扩散模型虽能提供视觉先验，但训练-推理不匹配和特征缺失限制了性能。

Method: DidSee通过改进噪声调度器消除信号泄漏偏差，采用单步训练减少误差累积，并引入语义增强器联合深度补全和语义分割，优化任务特定损失。

Result: DidSee在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，具有强鲁棒性和泛化能力，显著提升了下游任务（如姿态估计和机器人抓取）的效果。

Conclusion: DidSee通过创新的扩散框架解决了非朗伯物体深度补全的挑战，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for
non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to
generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent
advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models
to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that
biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion
framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the
lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders
precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a
diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects.
First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal
signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a
noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation
caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss.
Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion
and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding
precise, fine-grained depth maps. DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance
on multiple benchmarks, demonstrates robust real-world generalization, and
effectively improves downstream tasks such as category-level pose estimation
and robotic grasping.Project page: https://wenzhoulyu.github.io/DidSee/

Conclusion: 展示了扩散模型在域泛化和适应检测任务中的优势，为跨域视觉感知任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between
training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to
domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with
large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of
diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting
intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature
collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing
performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an
object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class
prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object.
We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch,
balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving
performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a
unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through
feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and
unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection
performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on
3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO
generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant
advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data
scenarios. Our work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to
domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights
for visual perception tasks across diverse domains. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决文本引导扩散模型中可编辑性与忠实度之间的固有权衡问题。

Method: 采用忠实度引导和调度策略（FGS），增强输入图像信息的保留，并解决可编辑性与忠实度的不对齐问题。

Result: 实验表明FGS在保持可编辑性的同时显著提升忠实度，且兼容多种编辑方法。

Conclusion: FGS为高质量图像编辑提供了一种有效的解决方案，适用于多样化任务。

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image
synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial
aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and
faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved.
However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent
trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose
Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with
minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to
strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a
scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and
faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior
faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with
various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across
diverse tasks.

Conclusion: 自监督ViT的双重特征能够有效提升对抗攻击的迁移性，为黑盒攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) come from extracting and
interpreting features from the data provided. By exploiting intermediate
features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial
perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box
transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in
previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised
learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether
exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve
adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual
self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural
features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked
image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We
design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to
create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by
exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs.
Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature
tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial
generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised
ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of
various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts. Code available at

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to
deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical
capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the
challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain
largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing
multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and
shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model
misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut
problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,
directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.
To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with
a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This
global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking
key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the
accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a
context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy
rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the
LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process
successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also
introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating
models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed
method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks
compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

Conclusion: RoI-Matching任务和RoI-Matcher框架为文档分析提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to
their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions,
such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only
suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve
flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new
task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for
short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient,
multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference
document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is
the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the
above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets
three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the
macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new
framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level
features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers
to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show
that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and
serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at

Conclusion: SAMURAI展示了形状和语言多模态结合在开放世界3D对象检索中的有效性。

Abstract: Retrieving 3D objects in complex indoor environments using only a masked 2D
image and a natural language description presents significant challenges. The
ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating
reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges
are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous
language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose
SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI
integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived
from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting
strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by
extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our
hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving
competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set. These results
highlight the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding
for robust open-world 3D object retrieval.

Conclusion: PoseMaster通过统一框架和优化条件控制，显著提升了3D角色生成的效率和质量。

Abstract: 3D characters play a crucial role in our daily entertainment. To improve the
efficiency of 3D character modeling, recent image-based methods use two
separate models to achieve pose standardization and 3D reconstruction of the
A-pose character. However, these methods are prone to generating distorted and
degraded images in the pose standardization stage due to self-occlusion and
viewpoints, which further affects the geometric quality of the subsequent
reconstruction process. To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an
end-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework. Specifically, we
unify pose transformation and 3D character generation into a flow-based 3D
native generation framework. To achieve accurate arbitrary-pose control, we
propose to leverage the 3D body bones existing in the skeleton of an animatable
character as the pose condition. Furthermore, considering the specificity of
multi-condition control, we randomly empty the pose condition and the image
condition during training to improve the effectiveness and generalizability of
pose control. Finally, we create a high-quality pose-control dataset derived
from realistic character animation data to make the model learning the implicit
relationships between skeleton and skinning weights. Extensive experiments show
that PoseMaster outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations for A-pose character generation while
demonstrating its powerful ability to achieve precise control for arbitrary
poses.

Abstract: Stereo matching has become an increasingly important component of modern
autonomous systems. Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that
deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major
challenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo
matching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost
volumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information
and also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and
regression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale
cost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising
route for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure
highly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the
Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with
small-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary
features into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from
the initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These
features are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a
compact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene
geometry. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large
receptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a
highly accurate disparity map at real-time. The compact version of ESMStereo
achieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX
Orin.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为OracleFusion的两阶段语义排版框架，用于解决甲骨文（OBS）未解读字符的复杂性和抽象性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文作为最早的古文字之一，其未解读字符的结构复杂且抽象，解读难度大。

Method: 第一阶段使用增强空间感知推理（SAR）的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）分析字形结构；第二阶段引入甲骨结构向量融合（OSVF），确保生成语义丰富的矢量字体。

Result: 实验表明，OracleFusion在语义、视觉吸引力和字形维护方面优于现有模型，显著提升了可读性和美观性。

Conclusion: OracleFusion为甲骨文解读提供了专家级见解，是推动甲骨文解读的有价值工具。

Abstract: As one of the earliest ancient languages, Oracle Bone Script (OBS)
encapsulates the cultural records and intellectual expressions of ancient
civilizations. Despite the discovery of approximately 4,500 OBS characters,
only about 1,600 have been deciphered. The remaining undeciphered ones, with
their complex structure and abstract imagery, pose significant challenges for
interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel
two-stage semantic typography framework, named OracleFusion. In the first
stage, this approach leverages the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with
enhanced Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze the glyph structure of
the OBS character and perform visual localization of key components. In the
second stage, we introduce Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF),
incorporating glyph structure constraints and glyph maintenance constraints to
ensure the accurate generation of semantically enriched vector fonts. This
approach preserves the objective integrity of the glyph structure, offering
visually enhanced representations that assist experts in deciphering OBS.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that
OracleFusion outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of
semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, significantly enhancing both
readability and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, OracleFusion provides
expert-like insights on unseen oracle characters, making it a valuable tool for
advancing the decipherment of OBS.

TL;DR: FlickCD提出了一种轻量级遥感变化检测模型，通过增强差异模块和多尺度局部-全局融合块，显著降低计算和存储开销，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习模型在变化检测中计算复杂但精度提升有限，研究旨在开发高效轻量模型，适用于卫星处理。

Method: FlickCD引入增强差异模块（EDM）抑制无关变化，并结合局部-全局融合块（SWSA和EGSA）捕捉多尺度语义信息。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，FlickCD计算和存储开销降低一个数量级，性能达到或接近SOTA，精度损失小于1%。

Conclusion: FlickCD在性能和资源消耗之间取得了优异平衡，适用于资源受限的卫星处理场景。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion,
disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and
large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep
learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and
computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into
significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study
explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that
maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an
essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose
FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries
of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced
Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between
temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and
weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change
decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion
Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global
Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple
scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments
on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and
storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\% F1)
accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了MultiClip-Bench数据集和IPFormer-VideoLLM模型，以解决VideoLLMs在多镜头场景中的性能问题，显著提升了多场景视频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VideoLLMs在多镜头场景（如不同摄像机角度或场景变化）中表现不佳，存在实例身份遗忘和关键帧忽略问题。

Method: 引入MultiClip-Bench数据集，并提出IPFormer-VideoLLM模型，通过基于注意力的连接器注入实例级特征作为提示。

Result: 实验表明，数据集和模型显著提升了多场景视频理解能力，并在多个视频基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: MultiClip-Bench数据集和IPFormer-VideoLLM模型有效解决了多镜头场景的挑战，为视频理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot
scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This
challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key
frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of
multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new
dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and
instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios.
We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot
performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the
model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering
that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy
manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new
model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level
features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector.
This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance
the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct
advantages across various video benchmarks.

TL;DR: HalluSegBench是一个新基准，用于评估视觉语言分割模型中的幻觉问题，通过反事实视觉推理诊断模型对视觉内容的忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割模型常产生与图像内容无关的分割掩码或错误标记区域，但现有评估协议未能充分诊断视觉上下文中的关键失败。

Method: 提出HalluSegBench基准，包含1340对反事实实例和281个对象类别，并引入新指标量化幻觉敏感性。

Result: 实验表明，视觉驱动的幻觉比标签驱动的更普遍，模型常持续错误分割。

Conclusion: 反事实推理对诊断视觉语言分割模型的忠实度至关重要。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced
grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit
hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the
image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing
evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or
textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their
capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce
HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual
reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual
instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly
introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually
coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art
vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations
are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often
persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual
reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

Result: 实验表明，CL-Splats在更新效率和重建质量上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: CL-Splats为实时3D场景重建任务提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over
time is crucial for applications in robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI.
As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to
maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational
overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats,
which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from
sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module
that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused,
local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats
supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal
segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved
reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust
foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: GoIRL框架通过逆强化学习和多模态轨迹生成，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents is a challenging task in
autonomous driving due to its inherent uncertainty and underlying
multimodality. Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on
supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor
equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor
to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless
integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward
distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple
plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a
hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to
enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost
prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse &
nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior
generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image

environmental illuminance drops as low as 0.0001 lux remains to be explored due
to the lack of corresponding datasets. To this end, we propose a
paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated
extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1
lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB
references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named
See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement
approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages
the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to
restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which
an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss
are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration.
Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code and dataset are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测因缺陷类型多样、形状不规则、细粒度要求高和复杂纹理而具有挑战性，现有AI检测方法存在冗余特征、细节敏感度不足和多尺度鲁棒性差的问题。

Method: 采用BiFPN架构增强双向多级特征聚合，引入DDFM模块捕捉细粒度结构变化，并提出两种注意力融合策略（AC和CAF）提升上下文表示和减少特征噪声。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，YOLO-FDA在准确性和鲁棒性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: YOLO-FDA通过创新架构和注意力机制，显著提升了工业表面缺陷检测的性能。

Abstract: Surface defect detection in industrial scenarios is both crucial and
technically demanding due to the wide variability in defect types, irregular
shapes and sizes, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures.
Although recent advances in AI-based detectors have improved performance,
existing methods often suffer from redundant features, limited detail
sensitivity, and weak robustness under multiscale conditions. To address these
challenges, we propose YOLO-FDA, a novel YOLO-based detection framework that
integrates fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion.
Specifically, we adopt a BiFPN-style architecture to strengthen bidirectional
multilevel feature aggregation within the YOLOv5 backbone. To better capture
fine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM)
that introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer
to enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level
features to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel
attention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and
Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and
reduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
terms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and
scales.

Result: 在包含107个类别的稀疏标注HSI数据集上达到SOTA性能，并能有效检测分布外（OOD）像素。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在提升分割性能的同时，支持OOD检测，适用于临床定义的语义树结构标签。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) shows great promise for surgical applications,
offering detailed insights into biological tissue differences beyond what the
naked eye can perceive. Refined labelling efforts are underway to train vision
systems to distinguish large numbers of subtly varying classes. However,
commonly used learning methods for biomedical segmentation tasks penalise all
errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the
label space. In this work, we introduce two tree-based semantic loss functions
which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further
incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with
sparse, background-free annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance on a sparsely annotated
HSI dataset comprising $107$ classes organised in a clinically-defined semantic
tree structure. Furthermore, our method enables effective detection of
out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels without compromising segmentation performance
on in-distribution (ID) pixels.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is essential
for clinical assessment and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a
robust deep-learning pipeline for fully automated myocardial scar detection and
segmentation by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models. The method explicitly
addresses challenges of label noise from semi-automatic annotations, data
heterogeneity, and class imbalance through the use of Kullback-Leibler loss and
extensive data augmentation. We evaluate the model's performance on both acute
and chronic cases and demonstrate its ability to produce accurate and smooth
segmentations despite noisy labels. In particular, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models like nnU-Net and shows strong generalizability in an
out-of-distribution test set, highlighting its robustness across various
imaging conditions and clinical tasks. These results establish a reliable
foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and support the broader

Conclusion: 该方法有效整合几何和感知先验，显著提升了单图像3D重建的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural
appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible
interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on
fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D
information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their
results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric
detail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly
integrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model
training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically,
we train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior,
perception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures
the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained
diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D
Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception
priors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth
consistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results
of our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据采集方法不同，3D物体形状的点集在训练和测试时存在显著的几何差异，导致Sim2Real领域差距，限制了点分类器的泛化能力。

Method: 通过利用全局空间拓扑和局部几何特征的拓扑关系，结合自监督学习任务，提出TAM框架。此外，采用跨域对比学习和自训练策略减少噪声伪标签的影响。

Result: 在三个公开的Sim2Real基准测试中，TAM框架表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAM框架有效缓解了Sim2Real领域差距，提升了点云分类的泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is
often challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to
differences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated
using point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D
sensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits
the generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,
domain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological
information, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the
source domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware
Modeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach
mitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized
by low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological
relations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning
task. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines
cross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the
impact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation
process. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the
effectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks. The source code of this
work will be available at https://github.com/zou-longkun/TAG.git.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解（LVU）因计算成本高而面临挑战，现有KV压缩方法在高压缩比下信息损失严重。

Method: 提出Video-X^2L，包含双层KV压缩（生成低压缩和高压缩KV）和选择性KV重加载（解码阶段动态选择KV）。

Result: 在多个LVU基准测试中表现优异，显著节省计算成本。

Conclusion: Video-X^2L无需额外训练，兼容现有MLLMs，是高效解决LVU问题的简单有效方案。

Abstract: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive
computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate
this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high
compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly
preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two
key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the
MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:
low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and
high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second
one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,
Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while
using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully
utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.
Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and
directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L
with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L
outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while
substantially saving the computation cost.

Conclusion: OccOoD和合成数据集有效解决了3D语义占用预测中的OoD问题，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing
a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing
methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases
the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards.
To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic
Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill the
gaps in the dataset, we propose a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline that
injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion
patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360.
We introduce OccOoD, a novel framework integrating OoD detection into 3D
semantic occupancy prediction, with Voxel-BEV Progressive Fusion (VBPF)
leveraging an RWKV-based branch to enhance OoD detection via geometry-semantic
fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art

### [104] [GroundFlow: A Plug-in Module for Temporal Reasoning on 3D Point Cloud Sequential Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21188)
*Zijun Lin,Shuting He,Cheston Tan,Bihan Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出GroundFlow模块，用于3D点云序列定位任务（SG3D），通过提取历史信息提升性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D视觉定位方法（3DVG）未充分利用多步文本指令中的时序信息，导致在SG3D任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出GroundFlow模块，选择性提取短期和长期历史信息，增强时序推理能力。

Result: 在SG3D基准测试中，GroundFlow显著提升基线方法准确率（+7.5%和+10.2%），优于预训练3D大语言模型。

Conclusion: GroundFlow为3DVG模型引入时序推理能力，在多个数据集中实现最佳性能。

Abstract: Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences
of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed
steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with
multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from
each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as
"it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires
grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information
from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an
effective module for collecting related historical information,
state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the
SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for
temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we
demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG
baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark,
even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets.
Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step
information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling
GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain
its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work
introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.

*Yihong Cao,Jiaming Zhang,Xu Zheng,Hao Shi,Kunyu Peng,Hang Liu,Kailun Yang,Hui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需源数据的全景图像分割方法UNLOCK，解决了传统方法依赖源数据的问题，并在性能上达到与依赖源数据方法相当的水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全景图像处理面临失真、遮挡和标注不足等问题，传统方法依赖源数据，限制了实用性。

Method: 提出UNLOCK框架，包含Omni Pseudo-Labeling Learning和Amodal-Driven Context Learning两个模块，无需源数据或目标标签即可适应。

Result: 在真实到真实和合成到真实的适应设置中，性能接近依赖源数据的方法，mAAP和mAP分别达到10.9和11.6，mAPQ提升+4.3。

Conclusion: UNLOCK为全景图像分割提供了一种更实用的解决方案，性能优越且无需源数据。

Abstract: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet
faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited
annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge
from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require
access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical
task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and
propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context
Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni
Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting
without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models
to achieve segmentation with 360{\deg} viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware
reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both
real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results
show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to
source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and
11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the
source-only method. All data and code will be made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedPrompt是一个统一的医学图像分析框架，结合了LLM的任务规划和模块化CNN的图像处理，支持用户自定义工作流，无需重新训练整个系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前医学图像分析系统任务单一、缺乏灵活性的问题。

Method: 结合LLM（Llama-4-17B）进行任务规划和模块化CNN（DeepFusionLab）进行图像处理，动态路由任务特定的预训练权重。

Result: 在19个公共数据集上表现优异，端到端正确率97%，推理延迟2.5秒，分割和分类性能强。

Conclusion: MedPrompt通过结合LLM的解释性和模块化CNN的效率，实现了可扩展的、提示驱动的医学图像分析。

Abstract: Current medical image analysis systems are typically task-specific, requiring
separate models for classification and segmentation, and lack the flexibility
to support user-defined workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce
MedPrompt, a unified framework that combines a few-shot prompted Large Language
Model (Llama-4-17B) for high-level task planning with a modular Convolutional
Neural Network (DeepFusionLab) for low-level image processing. The LLM
interprets user instructions and generates structured output to dynamically
route task-specific pretrained weights. This weight routing approach avoids
retraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific
weights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated
MedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging
modalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting
and executing prompt-driven instructions, with an average inference latency of
2.5 seconds, making it suitable for near real-time applications. DeepFusionLab
achieves competitive segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 on lungs) and
strong classification performance (F1 0.9744 on tuberculosis). Overall,
MedPrompt enables scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging by combining the
interpretability of LLMs with the efficiency of modular CNNs.

### [107] [BitMark for Infinity: Watermarking Bitwise Autoregressive Image Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21209)
*Louis Kerner,Michel Meintz,Bihe Zhao,Franziska Boenisch,Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出BitMark，一种针对Infinity文本到图像模型的鲁棒位级水印框架，以防止模型崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型输出在互联网上的广泛传播，这些内容可能被重新用作训练数据，导致模型性能逐渐退化（模型崩溃）。水印技术可以识别生成内容，从而缓解这一问题。

Method: BitMark通过在Infinity图像生成过程中，在多个尺度的令牌流中嵌入位级水印，既保持视觉保真度和生成速度，又对多种去除技术具有鲁棒性。

Result: BitMark具有高放射性，即使用水印图像训练其他生成模型时，新模型的输出也会携带水印。水印在扩散模型或自回归模型的微调后仍可检测。

Conclusion: BitMark为预防图像生成模型的崩溃提供了可靠的方法，通过检测生成内容来避免性能退化。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic
images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise
autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically
infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a
growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are
likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same
models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where
repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own
previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising
mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet
detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of
generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise
watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at
the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as
resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark
subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed
while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,
it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are
used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will
also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when
only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked
with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward
preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable
detection of generated outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的开集语义分割方法，通过优化数据质量显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练模型或合成数据，性能受限于模型能力或数据质量。本文关注数据质量问题，发现高质量参考集对无需训练的语义分割至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种数据质量导向的框架，包括构建高质量参考集的数据流程和基于相似性的检索方法。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上表现优于现有无需训练方法，验证了数据为中心的设计的重要性。

Conclusion: 数据质量对无需训练的开集语义分割至关重要，本文方法为这一领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment
images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model
fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of
pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex
retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by
the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets.
In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for
this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a
high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With
this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a
data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text
embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential
effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS
approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing
OVS without training. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiweix/ReME .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中虚假特征对分布外性能的负面影响，提升模型对新类别和分布变化的鲁棒性。

Method: 结合三个关键目标：不变与虚假特征的互信息最小化、虚假特征正则化和不变特征的对比学习。

Result: 在11个数据集上表现优于CoOp-OOD，基础类准确率提升15.27，新类别准确率提升44.31。

Conclusion: DiMPLe通过解耦和正则化多模态特征，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce DiMPLe (Disentangled Multi-Modal Prompt Learning), a novel
approach to disentangle invariant and spurious features across vision and
language modalities in multi-modal learning. Spurious correlations in visual
data often hinder out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Unlike prior methods
focusing solely on image features, DiMPLe disentangles features within and
across modalities while maintaining consistent alignment, enabling better
generalization to novel classes and robustness to distribution shifts. Our
method combines three key objectives: (1) mutual information minimization
between invariant and spurious features, (2) spurious feature regularization,
and (3) contrastive learning on invariant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DiMPLe demonstrates superior performance compared to CoOp-OOD, when
averaged across 11 diverse datasets, and achieves absolute gains of 15.27 in
base class accuracy and 44.31 in novel class accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体运动分割方法主要基于子空间聚类，假设高维时间数据符合子空间联合分布，但在复杂背景下可能不适用。

Method: TR²C方法联合学习结构化表示和亲和力，以分割视频帧序列，确保时间一致性与子空间结构对齐。

Result: 在五个基准HMS数据集上的实验表明，TR²C方法在不同特征提取器下均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TR²C方法通过结构化表示学习，有效解决了复杂背景下的人体运动分割问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), which aims to partition videos into
non-overlapping human motions, has attracted increasing research attention
recently. Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace
clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional
temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the
frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may
not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering
($\text{TR}^2\text{C}$), which jointly learns structured representations and
affinity to segment the frame sequences in video. Specifically, the structured
representations learned by $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$ maintain temporally consistent
and align well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for the HMS task. We
conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve
state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DuIOD的双增量目标检测方法，通过DuET框架解决了类别和域增量学习的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的目标检测系统需要同时学习新类别和适应环境变化，现有方法（CIOD和DIOD）仅解决单一方面问题，限制了实用性。

Method: 提出DuET框架，基于任务算术模型合并，引入方向一致性损失以减少符号冲突，支持多种检测器（如YOLO11和RT-DETR）。

Result: 在Pascal Series和Diverse Weather Series上，DuET分别实现了+13.12%和+11.39%的RAI提升，同时保持高Avg RI。

Conclusion: DuET在类别和域增量学习中表现出色，为实时目标检测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and
surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously
adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class
Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection
(DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen
domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new
classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more
practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an
exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging
framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign
conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods,
DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function
as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both
retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI),
which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting
and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common
ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series
demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while
preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39%
RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks),
outperforming existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频虚拟试穿方法在时空一致性和细节保留上的不足。

Method: 将视频虚拟试穿建模为条件视频修复任务，采用扩散变换器和3D时空注意力，结合多阶段训练和掩码策略。

Result: ViTI在定量和定性实验上优于现有方法，展现出更好的时空一致性和细节保留能力。

Conclusion: ViTI通过视频生成框架和条件修复策略，显著提升了视频虚拟试穿的效果。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in
consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output
video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the
details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames.
Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results
due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods,
though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal
attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task,
which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In
this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement
video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different
from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem
instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better
spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video
inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D
spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video
garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage
training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with
appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal
consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to
the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as
expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI
is superior to previous works.

Conclusion: 该方法在文字排版控制方面表现出色，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Achieving precise word-level typography control within generated images
remains a persistent challenge. To address it, we newly construct a word-level
controlled scene text dataset and introduce the Text-Image Alignment (TIA)
framework. This framework leverages cross-modal correspondence between text and
local image regions provided by grounding models to enhance the Text-to-Image
(T2I) model training. Furthermore, we propose WordCon, a hybrid
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. WordCon reparameterizes
selective key parameters, improving both efficiency and portability. This
allows seamless integration into diverse pipelines, including artistic text
rendering, text editing, and image-conditioned text rendering. To further
enhance controllability, the masked loss at the latent level is applied to
guide the model to concentrate on learning the text region in the image, and
the joint-attention loss provides feature-level supervision to promote
disentanglement between different words. Both qualitative and quantitative
results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art. The
datasets and source code will be available for academic use.

Motivation: 现有手术视频生成方法多为无条件生成，缺乏对手术动作和阶段的细粒度理解，导致生成内容与实际情况不一致。

Method: HieraSurg采用两阶段模型：第一阶段预测粗粒度语义变化，第二阶段结合细粒度视觉特征生成最终视频。

Conclusion: HieraSurg展示了在手术视频生成中的潜力，特别是在结合现有分割图时表现优异，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Surgical Video Synthesis has emerged as a promising research direction
following the success of diffusion models in general-domain video generation.
Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are
unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and
phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary
for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a
hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two
specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame,
HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a
segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a
second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with
fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and
integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages
surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical
phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental
results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model
significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively,
showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher
frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when
provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for
practical surgical applications.

Motivation: 现有持续学习方法在遥感领域需要大量标注数据，成本高且不现实，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: CoSMAE结合数据混合（保留先前数据分布）和模型混合知识蒸馏（同时从过去和当前模型蒸馏知识），在数据和模型层面正则化MAE。

Result: 实验表明，CoSMAE比现有方法提升高达4.94%。

Conclusion: CoSMAE通过双重混合策略有效减少灾难性遗忘，提升了持续学习性能。

Abstract: The development of continual learning (CL) methods, which aim to learn new
tasks in a sequential manner from the training data acquired continuously, has
gained great attention in remote sensing (RS). The existing CL methods in RS,
while learning new tasks, enhance robustness towards catastrophic forgetting.
This is achieved by using a large number of labeled training samples, which is
costly and not always feasible to gather in RS. To address this problem, we
propose a novel continual self-supervised learning method in the context of
masked autoencoders (denoted as CoSMAE). The proposed CoSMAE consists of two
components: i) data mixup; and ii) model mixup knowledge distillation. Data
mixup is associated with retaining information on previous data distributions
by interpolating images from the current task with those from the previous
tasks. Model mixup knowledge distillation is associated with distilling
knowledge from past models and the current model simultaneously by
interpolating their model weights to form a teacher for the knowledge
distillation. The two components complement each other to regularize the MAE at
the data and model levels to facilitate better generalization across tasks and
reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that
CoSMAE achieves significant improvements of up to 4.94% over state-of-the-art
CL methods applied to MAE. Our code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Visual grounding in text-rich document images is a critical yet underexplored
challenge for document intelligence and visual question answering (VQA)
systems. We present \drishtikon, a multi-granular visual grounding framework
designed to enhance interpretability and trust in VQA for complex, multilingual
documents. Our approach integrates robust multi-lingual OCR, large language
models, and a novel region matching algorithm to accurately localize answer
spans at block, line, word, and point levels. We curate a new benchmark from
the CircularsVQA test set, providing fine-grained, human-verified annotations
across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with line-level
granularity offering the best trade-off between precision and recall. Ablation
studies further highlight the benefits of multi-block and multi-line reasoning.
Comparative evaluations with leading vision-language models reveal the
limitations of current VLMs in precise localization, underscoring the
effectiveness of our structured, alignment-based approach. Our findings pave
the way for more robust and interpretable document understanding systems in
real-world, text-centric scenarios. Code and dataset has been made available at

vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for
generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual
features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise
understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset
comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric
tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex
reasoning. We establish an Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding
Benchmark (E-HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action
understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and
evaluate our resulting LLaVA-Pose model on the benchmark, achieving significant
improvements. Experimental results show an overall improvement of 33.2%
compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of keypoint-integrated data in enhancing multimodal models for
human-centric visual understanding. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法高效解决了长时间手术视频分析问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Surgical workflow analysis is essential in robot-assisted surgeries, yet the
long duration of such procedures poses significant challenges for comprehensive
video analysis. Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer
models; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient
processing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel
hierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear
scaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length
videos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework
incorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a
state space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal
information. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a
local-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate
local dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models
temporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a
hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete
phase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the
network. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on
MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available
after paper acceptance.

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，速度比现有方法快多个数量级。

Conclusion: PanSt3R是一种简单、快速且可扩展的方法，解决了3D场景全景分割的挑战。

Abstract: Panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes, involving the segmentation and
classification of object instances in a dense 3D reconstruction of a scene, is
a challenging problem, especially when relying solely on unposed 2D images.
Existing approaches typically leverage off-the-shelf models to extract
per-frame 2D panoptic segmentations, before optimizing an implicit geometric
representation (often based on NeRF) to integrate and fuse the 2D predictions.
We argue that relying on 2D panoptic segmentation for a problem inherently 3D
and multi-view is likely suboptimal as it fails to leverage the full potential
of spatial relationships across views. In addition to requiring camera
parameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive
test-time optimization for each scene. Instead, in this work, we propose a
unified and integrated approach PanSt3R, which eliminates the need for
test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view
panoptic segmentation in a single forward pass. Our approach builds upon recent
advances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view
version of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view
panoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard
post-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach
for multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating
novel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS.
Overall, the proposed PanSt3R is conceptually simple, yet fast and scalable,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, while being
orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物理驱动的通用框架，用于解决电磁逆散射问题（EISP），通过两阶段逆传输-散射过程，利用诱导电流作为中间表示，显著提升了重建精度、泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Motivation: 现有机器学习方法（如Img-Interiors）在解决EISP时存在泛化能力差、对稀疏发射器设置敏感等问题，需要从物理角度重新设计解决方案。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：电流估计器学习入射场与散射场之间的物理桥梁（诱导电流），介电常数求解器直接从估计的电流计算相对介电常数。

Conclusion: 该研究为电磁逆散射问题提供了新的物理驱动视角，是迈向低成本实用电磁成像解决方案的重要一步。

Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in
applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the
relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse
process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly
challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows
promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it
requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and
fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To
address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective,
reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This
formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate
representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from
the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first
generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator
and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current
estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between
the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the
relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design
enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of
relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to
transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic
inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical
solutions for electromagnetic imaging.

Result: 现有模型在ShotBench上平均准确率不足60%，而ShotVL显著优于所有现有模型，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: ShotBench和ShotQA推动了AI在电影理解与生成领域的进步，开源资源将加速研究发展。

Abstract: Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for
conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding,
their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded
within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation.
This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the
precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{ShotBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA
pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed
(predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography
dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their
substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60\%
average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and
complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct
\textbf{ShotQA}, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k
cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop \textbf{ShotVL} through
supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL
significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on
ShotBench, establishing new \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance. We
open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial
area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.

Conclusion: CoPa-SG为场景图研究提供了高质量数据和新工具，推动了场景理解的进步。

Abstract: 2D scene graphs provide a structural and explainable framework for scene
understanding. However, current work still struggles with the lack of accurate
scene graph data. To overcome this data bottleneck, we present CoPa-SG, a
synthetic scene graph dataset with highly precise ground truth and exhaustive
relation annotations between all objects. Moreover, we introduce parametric and
proto-relations, two new fundamental concepts for scene graphs. The former
provides a much more fine-grained representation than its traditional
counterpart by enriching relations with additional parameters such as angles or
distances. The latter encodes hypothetical relations in a scene graph and
describes how relations would form if new objects are placed in the scene.
Using CoPa-SG, we compare the performance of various scene graph generation
models. We demonstrate how our new relation types can be integrated in
downstream applications to enhance planning and reasoning capabilities.

Result: 在KITTI和Cityscapes3D数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提供了一种低成本、可扩展的高质量标注方案。

Conclusion: ToosiCubix为无需专业设备的3D标注提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Many existing methods for 3D cuboid annotation of vehicles rely on expensive
and carefully calibrated camera-LiDAR or stereo setups, limiting their
accessibility for large-scale data collection. We introduce ToosiCubix, a
simple yet powerful approach for annotating ground-truth cuboids using only
monocular images and intrinsic camera parameters. Our method requires only
about 10 user clicks per vehicle, making it highly practical for adding 3D
annotations to existing datasets originally collected without specialized
equipment. By annotating specific features (e.g., wheels, car badge,
symmetries) across different vehicle parts, we accurately estimate each
vehicle's position, orientation, and dimensions up to a scale ambiguity (8
DoF). The geometric constraints are formulated as an optimization problem,
which we solve using a coordinate descent strategy, alternating between
Perspective-n-Points (PnP) and least-squares subproblems. To handle common
ambiguities such as scale and unobserved dimensions, we incorporate
probabilistic size priors, enabling 9 DoF cuboid placements. We validate our
annotations against the KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets, demonstrating that our
method offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for high-quality 3D cuboid
annotation.

Motivation: 图像和点云特征通道注意力差异导致匹配结果退化，场景中相似结构导致冗余对应关系。

Method: 提出Channel Adaptive Adjustment Module (CAA)增强模态内特征并抑制跨模态敏感性，Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS)用全局优化替代局部选择。

Result: 在RGB-D Scenes V2和7-Scenes上实验，取得图像到点云配准的最优性能。

Conclusion: CAA和GOS模块有效解决了跨模态匹配问题，提升了配准精度。

Abstract: Detection-free methods typically follow a coarse-to-fine pipeline, extracting
image and point cloud features for patch-level matching and refining dense
pixel-to-point correspondences. However, differences in feature channel
attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching
results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar
structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal
matching. To address these issues, we propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment
Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances
intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces
local selection with global optimization. Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and
7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

Motivation: 现有方法在数据稀缺环境中主要依赖有限正常样本生成原型，但忽略了利用查询图像统计信息提升原型代表性。

Method: FastRef采用两阶段迭代过程：1）通过可优化变换矩阵将查询特征转移到原型；2）通过原型对齐抑制异常。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，FastRef在1/2/4-shot设置下均表现出高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: FastRef通过系统整合查询图像统计信息，显著提升了少样本工业异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) presents a critical challenge
for practical automated inspection systems operating in data-scarce
environments. While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving
prototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to
systematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype
representativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and
efficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates
through an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query
features to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2)
anomaly suppression through prototype alignment. The characteristic transfer is
achieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while
the anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike
conventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting
makes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal
transport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the
gap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression.
For comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive
prototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO.
Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and
RealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our
approach under 1/2/4-shots.

Method: 提出了一种双向耦合机制，将参数曲线与边缘导向的高斯分量结合，形成可微渲染的曲线感知表示（CurveGaussian），并引入动态自适应拓扑优化框架。

Result: 在ABC数据集和真实场景基准测试中，该方法优于两阶段方法，重建结果更干净、更鲁棒，且参数数量显著减少。

Conclusion: 单阶段优化直接重建参数曲线，提高了效率和性能，为3D曲线重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 3D parametric
curves directly from multi-view edge maps. Contrasting with existing two-stage
methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and
parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D
parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation
caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However,
parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view
optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their
geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a
novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and
edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a
curve-aware Gaussian representation, \textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables
differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by
multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology
optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through
linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive
evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our
one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in
producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly
optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter
count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior
performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: XVerse在多主题控制生成中表现出色，为复杂场景提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained control over subject identity and semantic attributes
(pose, style, lighting) in text-to-image generation, particularly for multiple
subjects, often undermines the editability and coherence of Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs). Many approaches introduce artifacts or suffer from
attribute entanglement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
multi-subject controlled generation model XVerse. By transforming reference
images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, XVerse allows
for precise and independent control for specific subject without disrupting
image latents or features. Consequently, XVerse offers high-fidelity, editable
multi-subject image synthesis with robust control over individual subject
characteristics and semantic attributes. This advancement significantly
improves personalized and complex scene generation capabilities.

Conclusion: 结合光流和深度正则化的3DGS SLAM方法有效提升了内窥镜场景的3D重建和实时可视化性能。

Abstract: Efficient three-dimensional reconstruction and real-time visualization are
critical in surgical scenarios such as endoscopy. In recent years, 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in efficient 3D
reconstruction and rendering. Most 3DGS-based Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM) methods only rely on the appearance constraints for optimizing
both 3DGS and camera poses. However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges
include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and
dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To
address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a
geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the
scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation
strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the
validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve
scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement
strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal
rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive
experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both
static and dynamic surgical scenes. The source code will be publicly available
upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Medical imaging datasets often contain heterogeneous biases ranging from
erroneous labels to inconsistent labeling styles. Such biases can negatively
impact deep segmentation networks performance. Yet, the identification and
characterization of such biases is a particularly tedious and challenging task.
In this paper, we introduce HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network
predicting UNets' parameters from latent vectors representing both the image
and annotation variability. The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector
collection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly
learned. Hence, instead of optimizing a single neural network to fit a dataset,
HyperSORT learns a complex distribution of UNet parameters where low density
areas can capture noise-specific patterns while larger modes robustly segment
organs in differentiated but meaningful manners. We validate our method on two
3D abdominal CT public datasets: first a synthetically perturbed version of the
AMOS dataset, and TotalSegmentator, a large scale dataset containing real
unknown biases and errors. Our experiments show that HyperSORT creates a
structured mapping of the dataset allowing the identification of relevant
systematic biases and erroneous samples. Latent space clusters yield UNet
parameters performing the segmentation task in accordance with the underlying
learned systematic bias. The code and our analysis of the TotalSegmentator
dataset are made available: https://github.com/ImFusionGmbH/HyperSORT

Abstract: Atypical mitoses mark a deviation in the cell division process that can be an
independent prognostically relevant marker for tumor malignancy. However, their
identification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle
morphological differences from normal mitoses, low inter-rater agreement among
pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis
dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive
benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic
figure (AMF) classification, including baseline models, foundation models with
linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation
(LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new hold-out AMF
datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitoses from the The TCGA breast cancer
cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitoses from the MIDOG++

Abstract: Image editing approaches have become more powerful and flexible with the
advent of powerful text-conditioned generative models. However, placing objects
in an environment with a precise location and orientation still remains a
challenge, as this typically requires carefully crafted inpainting masks or
prompts. In this work, we show that a carefully designed visual map, combined
with coarse object masks, is sufficient for high quality object placement. We
design a conditioning signal that resolves ambiguities, while being flexible
enough to allow for changing of shapes or object orientations. By building on
an inpainting model, we leave the background intact by design, in contrast to
methods that model objects and background jointly. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in the automotive setting, where we compare
different conditioning signals in novel object placement tasks. These tasks are
designed to measure edit quality not only in terms of appearance, but also in
terms of pose and location accuracy, including cases that require non-trivial
shape changes. Lastly, we show that fine location control can be combined with
appearance control to place existing objects in precise locations in a scene.

Abstract: Underground mining operations face significant safety challenges that make
emergency response capabilities crucial. While robots have shown promise in
assisting with search and rescue operations, their effectiveness depends on
reliable miner detection capabilities. Deep learning algorithms offer potential
solutions for automated miner detection, but require comprehensive training
datasets, which are currently lacking for underground mining environments. This
paper presents a novel thermal imaging dataset specifically designed to enable
the development and validation of miner detection systems for potential
emergency applications. We systematically captured thermal imagery of various
mining activities and scenarios to create a robust foundation for detection
algorithms. To establish baseline performance metrics, we evaluated several
state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11,
and RT-DETR on our dataset. While not exhaustive of all possible emergency
situations, this dataset serves as a crucial first step toward developing
reliable thermal-based miner detection systems that could eventually be
deployed in real emergency scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
using thermal imaging for miner detection and establishes a foundation for
future research in this critical safety application.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高引导尺度在增强条件扩散模型性能的同时，常导致过饱和和不真实伪影，低频信号中的冗余信息积累是主要原因。

Method: 提出LF-CFG方法，通过自适应阈值定位冗余信息，分析低频信息变化率确定合理阈值，并采用降权策略减少冗余信息影响。

Result: 实验表明，LF-CFG在多种扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion-XL等）中有效缓解了过饱和和不真实伪影。

Conclusion: LF-CFG通过低频信号优化，显著改善了高引导尺度下的模型表现。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) succeeds in condition diffusion models that
use a guidance scale to balance the influence of conditional and unconditional
terms. A high guidance scale is used to enhance the performance of the
conditional term. However, the high guidance scale often results in
oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a new
perspective based on low-frequency signals, identifying the accumulation of
redundant information in these signals as the key factor behind oversaturation
and unrealistic artifacts. Building on this insight, we propose low-frequency
improved classifier-free guidance (LF-CFG) to mitigate these issues.
Specifically, we introduce an adaptive threshold-based measurement to pinpoint
the locations of redundant information. We determine a reasonable threshold by
analyzing the change rate of low-frequency information between prior and
current steps. We then apply a down-weight strategy to reduce the impact of
redundant information in the low-frequency signals. Experimental results
demonstrate that LF-CFG effectively alleviates oversaturation and unrealistic
artifacts across various diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion-XL,
Stable Diffusion 2.1, 3.0, 3.5, and SiT-XL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 转向运动计数数据对交通信号设计、交叉口规划和拥堵分析至关重要，但现有方法未能充分适应交通流的变化模式。

Method: 开发了基于视觉的跟踪系统估计TMC，结合仿真工具SUMO评估信号配置性能，并提出了动态、静态和混合三种信号配置方法。

Result: 实验显示90和120秒周期时间效果最佳，动态配置在四个交叉口表现更好，混合方法适应高峰和非高峰交通流。

Conclusion: 混合信号方法在交通流分布不均时表现优异，为交通信号设计提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design,
intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This
work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration
for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to
estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The
intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal
configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into
Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The
initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the
cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,
four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing
configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of
total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic
flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that
switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak
traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic
generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and
a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,
dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted
differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse
traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4
hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions
affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for
evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly
weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.

Result: 在层次物种分类和层次检索任务中，模型性能优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: RCME框架有效提升了视觉语言模型中层次结构的表示能力，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Learning the hierarchical structure of data in vision-language models is a
significant challenge. Previous works have attempted to address this challenge
by employing entailment learning. However, these approaches fail to model the
transitive nature of entailment explicitly, which establishes the relationship
between order and semantics within a representation space. In this work, we
introduce Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME), a framework that enables the
explicit modeling of transitivity-enforced entailment. Our proposed framework
optimizes for the partial order of concepts within vision-language models. By
leveraging our framework, we develop a hierarchical vision-language foundation
model capable of representing the hierarchy in the Tree of Life. Our
experiments on hierarchical species classification and hierarchical retrieval
tasks demonstrate the enhanced performance of our models compared to the
existing state-of-the-art models. Our code and models are open-sourced at

Conclusion: TITAN通过优化伪标签生成和域间对齐，有效提升了源不可用域自适应目标检测的性能。

Abstract: We focus on the source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD)
problem when source data is unavailable during adaptation and the model must
adapt to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of approaches for the problem
employ a self-supervised approach using a student-teacher (ST) framework where
pseudo-labels are generated via a source-pretrained model for further
fine-tuning. We observe that the performance of a student model often degrades
drastically, due to the collapse of the teacher model, primarily caused by high
noise in pseudo-labels, resulting from domain bias, discrepancies, and a
significant domain shift across domains. To obtain reliable pseudo-labels, we
propose a Target-based Iterative Query-Token Adversarial Network (TITAN), which
separates the target images into two subsets: those similar to the source
(easy) and those dissimilar (hard). We propose a strategy to estimate variance
to partition the target domain. This approach leverages the insight that higher
detection variances correspond to higher recall and greater similarity to the
source domain. Also, we incorporate query-token-based adversarial modules into
a student-teacher baseline framework to reduce the domain gaps between two
feature representations. Experiments conducted on four natural imaging datasets
and two challenging medical datasets have substantiated the superior
performance of TITAN compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methodologies. We report an mAP improvement of +22.7, +22.2, +21.1, and +3.7
percent over the current SOTA on C2F, C2B, S2C, and K2C benchmarks,
respectively.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have set the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks
such as bounding box detection and semantic segmentation. Object detectors and
segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the
model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However,
these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and
loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic
foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to
quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not
make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is
truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as
automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this
work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics.
Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used
to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as
bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of
bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a
likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for
whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of
performance.

Motivation: 现有方法在解决LVLM中的幻觉问题时存在静态约束、效率低下和细节丢失等局限性，需要一种更灵活高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: DLC是一种高效且有效的解码时解决方案，能够提升LVLM的可靠性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by
hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing
training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the
use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during
generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes,
and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome
these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a
novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text
generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC
step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image
and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of
candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual
baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually
grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time
context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring
the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted
across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA,
InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces
hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference
efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an
effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations,
thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be
released on Github.

Conclusion: GGTalker通过通用先验和个体适应解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了高质量的3D说话头部合成。

Abstract: Creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads remains a
persistent challenge. Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed
viewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head
rotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained
by the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core
issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation
capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose
GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of
generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage
Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to
individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual
priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general
distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual
speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we
introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a
Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing
indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames. Comprehensive experiments show
that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D
consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: G$^{2}$D有效解决了模态不平衡问题，提升了多模态学习的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to leverage information from diverse data modalities
to achieve more comprehensive performance. However, conventional multimodal
models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities
dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and
underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce
Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework
that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that
fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a
dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning
process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the
pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D
on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the
significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in classification and regression tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in scene reconstruction have pushed toward highly realistic
modeling of autonomous driving (AD) environments using 3D Gaussian splatting.
However, the resulting reconstructions remain closely tied to the original
observations and struggle to support photorealistic synthesis of significantly
altered or novel driving scenarios. This work introduces MADrive, a
memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities
of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with
visually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank.
Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of ${\sim}70$K 360{\deg}
car videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the
most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding
3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through
orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide
complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling
photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as
demonstrated in our experiments. Project page:

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了集合表示的局限性，提升了跨模态检索的准确性。

Abstract: Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse
possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional
methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample,
but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across
modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple
embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more
diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise,
these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse
supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address
these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize
one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity
within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the
representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among
embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k
without relying on external data.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have demonstrated impressive performance in
point cloud representation learning by leveraging State Space Model (SSM) with
the efficient context modeling ability and linear complexity. However, these
methods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying
the adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain
long-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To
address these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for
self-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits.
First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial
dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update
strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions
between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method
reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input
lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental
results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our
method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image is a long-standing challenge,
especially under real-world occlusions. While recent diffusion-based view
synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image,
they generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object
are occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction
quality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for
occlusion-aware multi-view generation. Our method directly synthesizes six
structurally consistent novel views from a single partially occluded image,
enabling downstream 3D reconstruction without requiring prior inpainting or
manual annotations. We construct a self-supervised training pipeline using the
Pix2Gestalt dataset, leveraging occluded-unoccluded image pairs and
pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and
view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully
fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view
generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware
reconstruction, encompassing diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and
mask patterns. This benchmark provides a standardized protocol for evaluating
future methods under partial occlusions. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM4D是一个多模态时序基础模型，用于相机和LiDAR流的可提示分割，通过UMPE和MCMA技术实现跨模态一致性和动态场景分割，并通过自动化数据引擎快速生成伪标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶场景中相机和LiDAR数据的跨模态分割问题，同时避免人工标注瓶颈。

Method: 提出UMPE对齐多模态特征，MCMA增强时序一致性，并开发自动化数据引擎生成伪标签。

Result: 在Waymo-4DSeg上验证了强大的跨模态分割能力和高效数据标注潜力。

Conclusion: SAM4D在跨模态分割和数据标注方面表现出色，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: We present SAM4D, a multi-modal and temporal foundation model designed for
promptable segmentation across camera and LiDAR streams. Unified Multi-modal
Positional Encoding (UMPE) is introduced to align camera and LiDAR features in
a shared 3D space, enabling seamless cross-modal prompting and interaction.
Additionally, we propose Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA),
which leverages ego-motion compensation to enhance temporal consistency and
long-horizon feature retrieval, ensuring robust segmentation across dynamically
changing autonomous driving scenes. To avoid annotation bottlenecks, we develop
a multi-modal automated data engine that synergizes VFM-driven video masklets,
spatiotemporal 4D reconstruction, and cross-modal masklet fusion. This
framework generates camera-LiDAR aligned pseudo-labels at a speed orders of
magnitude faster than human annotation while preserving VFM-derived semantic
fidelity in point cloud representations. We conduct extensive experiments on
the constructed Waymo-4DSeg, which demonstrate the powerful cross-modal
segmentation ability and great potential in data annotation of proposed SAM4D.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SiM3D是首个结合多视角和多模态信息的3D异常检测与分割（ADS）基准，专注于单实例异常检测，并首次解决从合成训练数据泛化到真实测试数据的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 制造业中单实例异常检测的需求迫切，但现有方法缺乏多视角和多模态信息的整合，且泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出SiM3D基准，包含多模态多视角数据集（高分辨率图像和点云），并采用新颖的指标评估基于体素的异常体积。

Result: SiM3D数据集包含333个实例的八类对象，提供手动标注的3D分割GT，并评估了单视角方法的性能。

Conclusion: SiM3D为多视角3D ADS任务提供了首个基准，填补了从合成数据泛化到真实数据的空白。

Abstract: We propose SiM3D, the first benchmark considering the integration of
multiview and multimodal information for comprehensive 3D anomaly detection and
segmentation (ADS), where the task is to produce a voxel-based Anomaly Volume.
Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing:
single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or
synthetic, is available for training. In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the
first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic
training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview
dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset
features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points)
for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each
type. We also provide manually annotated 3D segmentation GTs for anomalous test
samples. To establish reference baselines for the proposed multiview 3D ADS
task, we adapt prominent singleview methods and assess their performance using
novel metrics that operate on Anomaly Volumes.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ClusterRCA是一种用于高性能计算系统网络故障诊断的新框架，通过多模态数据和图分析方法实现高精度故障定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高性能计算系统的网络故障诊断因数据异构性和准确性不足而具有挑战性，现有方法难以直接应用。

Method: ClusterRCA结合分类器和图分析方法，从多模态数据中提取特征，构建故障图并通过随机游走定位故障节点。

Result: 实验表明，ClusterRCA在高性能计算系统中实现了高精度的故障诊断，并在不同应用场景中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ClusterRCA为高性能计算系统的网络故障诊断提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Network failure diagnosis is challenging yet critical for high-performance
computing (HPC) systems. Existing methods cannot be directly applied to HPC
scenarios due to data heterogeneity and lack of accuracy. This paper proposes a
novel framework, called ClusterRCA, to localize culprit nodes and determine
failure types by leveraging multimodal data. ClusterRCA extracts features from
topologically connected network interface controller (NIC) pairs to analyze the
diverse, multimodal data in HPC systems. To accurately localize culprit nodes
and determine failure types, ClusterRCA combines classifier-based and
graph-based approaches. A failure graph is constructed based on the output of
the state classifier, and then it performs a customized random walk on the
graph to localize the root cause. Experiments on datasets collected by a
top-tier global HPC device vendor show ClusterRCA achieves high accuracy in
diagnosing network failure for HPC systems. ClusterRCA also maintains robust
performance across different application scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分布式数据分析框架，用于高效处理大规模GPU性能日志，解决了现有工具内存占用高、处理时间长的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具处理大规模GPU性能日志时内存需求高、运行时间长，无法满足自动化工作流的实时分析需求。

Method: 通过将数据集分区为可独立分析的片段，并利用MPI并行处理，减少单节点内存压力，避免中心瓶颈。

Result: 框架成功应用于真实HPC和AI工作负载的Nsight Compute跟踪数据，能够诊断性能变化并揭示内存传输延迟对GPU内核行为的影响。

Conclusion: 该分布式框架显著提升了大规模性能日志的分析效率，适用于复杂和高维跟踪数据的低延迟探索。

Abstract: Analyzing large-scale performance logs from GPU profilers often requires
terabytes of memory and hours of runtime, even for basic summaries. These
constraints prevent timely insight and hinder the integration of performance
analytics into automated workflows. Existing analysis tools typically process
data sequentially, making them ill-suited for HPC workflows with growing trace
complexity and volume. We introduce a distributed data analysis framework that
scales with dataset size and compute availability. Rather than treating the
dataset as a single entity, our system partitions it into independently
analyzable shards and processes them concurrently across MPI ranks. This design
reduces per-node memory pressure, avoids central bottlenecks, and enables
low-latency exploration of high-dimensional trace data. We apply the framework
to end-to-end Nsight Compute traces from real HPC and AI workloads, demonstrate
its ability to diagnose performance variability, and uncover the impact of
memory transfer latency on GPU kernel behavior.

### [153] [Utility-Driven Speculative Decoding for Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20675)
*Anish Saxena,Po-An Tsai,Hritvik Taneja,Aamer Jaleel,Moinuddin Qureshi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: GPU内存带宽是低延迟大语言模型（LLM）推理的主要瓶颈。推测解码通过轻量级草稿器提出K个令牌，LLM并行验证以提高令牌吞吐量。然而，对于混合专家（MoE）模型，推测解码因激活更多权重而增加数据移动和验证时间，导致速度下降。Cascade框架通过动态调整K值选择性启用推测解码，避免减速并提升吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE模型中推测解码因权重激活增加导致的性能下降问题，使其在实际应用中可行。

Method: 提出Cascade框架，通过轻量级指标“推测效用”动态调整K值，选择性启用推测解码。

Result: Cascade在vLLM中实现，评估显示其将减速限制在5%（相比1.5倍），吞吐量提升7-14%。

Conclusion: Cascade使推测解码在MoE模型中变得实用，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: GPU memory bandwidth is the main bottleneck for low-latency Large Language
Model (LLM) inference. Speculative decoding leverages idle GPU compute by using
a lightweight drafter to propose K tokens, which the LLM verifies in parallel,
boosting token throughput. In conventional dense LLMs, all model weights are
fetched each iteration, so speculation adds no latency overhead. Emerging
Mixture of Experts (MoE) models activate only a subset of weights per token,
greatly reducing data movement. However, we show that speculation is
ineffective for MoEs: draft tokens collectively activate more weights,
increasing data movement and verification time by 2-3x. When token throughput
gains fail to offset this overhead, speculation causes slowdowns up to 1.5x,
making it infeasible. Even when useful, the optimal K varies by task, model,
and even between requests and iterations. Thus, despite widespread use in dense
LLMs, speculation remains impractical in leading MoEs.
  We present Cascade, a utility-driven framework that selectively enables
speculation to avoid slowdowns and dynamically tunes K to accelerate MoE
serving. Cascade uses a lightweight metric, speculation utility, the ratio of
token gains to verification cost, which shows iteration-level locality,
enabling periodic decisions via short test and longer set phases. For each
request, Cascade disables speculation if utility drops below one during
testing, and when utility exceeds one, tests multiple K-values to choose the
utility-maximizing K for the set phase. We implement Cascade in vLLM and
evaluate it on five popular MoEs with workloads spanning code, math,
extraction, and mixed tasks. Cascade limits slowdown to 5% (vs. 1.5x) and
improves throughput by 7-14% over static K, making speculative decoding
practical for MoEs.

Motivation: GPGPU架构多样化导致编程模型和软件栈复杂化，现有可移植执行模型仍需开发者大量优化工作，LLM有望减轻这一负担。

Method: 开发了ParEval-Repo基准测试框架，包含多种编程模型的科学计算和AI小应用，评估开源和商业LLM在代码翻译中的表现。

Result: LLM能成功翻译小型科学应用，但在生成功能性构建系统和处理跨文件依赖时，难以扩展到大型代码库。

Conclusion: LLM在自动翻译代码库方面有潜力，但需进一步解决大型代码库的构建和依赖问题。

Abstract: GPGPU architectures have become significantly diverse in recent years, which
has led to an emergence of a variety of specialized programming models and
software stacks to support them. While portable execution models exist, they
still require significant developer effort to port to and optimize for
different hardware architectures. Recent advances in large language models
(LLMs) can help us reduce some of this programmer burden. In this paper, we
present a novel benchmark and testing framework, ParEval-Repo, which can be
used to evaluate the efficacy of LLM-based approaches in automatically
translating entire codebases across GPGPU execution models. ParEval-Repo
includes several scientific computing and AI mini-applications in a range of
programming models, and levels of repository complexity. We use ParEval-Repo to
evaluate a range of state-of-the-art open-source and commercial LLMs, with both
a non-agentic and a top-down agentic approach. We assess code generated by the
LLMs and approaches in terms of compilability, functional correctness,
categories of build errors, and the cost of translation in terms of the number
of inference tokens. Our results demonstrate that LLM translation of scientific
applications is feasible for small programs but difficulty with generating
functional build systems and cross-file dependencies pose challenges in scaling
to larger codebases.

Conclusion: 自动代码生成是确保大规模科学应用长期可持续性的可行解决方案。

Abstract: With the emergence of new high-performance computing (HPC) accelerators, such
as Nvidia and AMD GPUs, efficiently targeting diverse hardware architectures
has become a major challenge for HPC application developers. The increasing
hardware diversity in HPC systems often necessitates the development of
architecture-specific code, hindering the sustainability of large-scale
scientific applications. In this work, we leverage DaCe, a data-centric
parallel programming framework, to automate the generation of high-performance
kernels. DaCe enables automatic code generation for multicore processors and
various accelerators, reducing the burden on developers who would otherwise
need to rewrite code for each new architecture. Our study demonstrates DaCe's
capabilities by applying its automatic code generation to a critical
computational kernel used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Specifically,
we focus on Neko, a Fortran-based solver that employs the spectral-element
method, which relies on small tensor operations. We detail the formulation of
this computational kernel using DaCe's Stateful Dataflow Multigraph (SDFG)
representation and discuss how this approach facilitates high-performance code
generation. Additionally, we outline the workflow for seamlessly integrating
DaCe's generated code into the Neko solver. Our results highlight the
portability and performance of the generated code across multiple platforms,
including Nvidia GH200, Nvidia A100, and AMD MI250X GPUs, with competitive
performance results. By demonstrating the potential of automatic code
generation, we emphasise the feasibility of using portable solutions to ensure
the long-term sustainability of large-scale scientific applications.

Result: 实验表明，该框架在区块链环境中实现了高效的大语言模型知识共享。

Conclusion: 基于区块链的框架有效解决了知识孤岛问题，为大语言模型提供了可靠的外部知识支持。

Abstract: The hallucination problem of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly
drawn attention. Augmenting LLMs with external knowledge is a promising
solution to address this issue. However, due to privacy and security concerns,
a vast amount of downstream task-related knowledge remains dispersed and
isolated across various "silos," making it difficult to access. To bridge this
knowledge gap, we propose a blockchain-based external knowledge framework that
coordinates multiple knowledge silos to provide reliable foundational knowledge
for large model retrieval while ensuring data security. Technically, we distill
knowledge from local data into prompts and execute transactions and records on
the blockchain. Additionally, we introduce a reputation mechanism and
cross-validation to ensure knowledge quality and provide incentives for
participation. Furthermore, we design a query generation framework that
provides a direct API interface for large model retrieval. To evaluate the
performance of our proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments on
various knowledge sources. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework
achieves efficient LLM service knowledge sharing in blockchain environments.

Result: 实测显示，该架构能在几秒内完成最终确认，执行成本低，支持复杂的比特币去中心化应用。

Conclusion: 该架构为比特币智能合约提供了更安全、高效的实现方式，具有独立的研究价值和应用潜力。

Abstract: There is growing interest in providing programmatic access to the value
locked in Bitcoin, which famously offers limited programmability itself.
Various approaches have been put forth in recent years, with the vast majority
of proposed mechanisms either building new functionality on top of Bitcoin or
leveraging a bridging mechanism to enable smart contracts that make use of
``wrapped'' bitcoins on entirely different platforms.
  In this work, an architecture is presented that follows a different approach.
The architecture enables the execution of Turing-complete Bitcoin smart
contracts on the Internet Computer (IC), a blockchain platform for hosting and
executing decentralized applications. Instead of using a bridge, IC and Bitcoin
nodes interact directly, eliminating potential security risks that the use of a
bridge entails. This integration requires novel concepts, in particular to
reconcile the probabilistic nature of Bitcoin with the irreversibility of
finalized state changes on the IC, which may be of independent interest.
  In addition to the presentation of the architecture, we provide evaluation
results based on measurements of the Bitcoin integration running on mainnet.
The evaluation results demonstrate that, with finalization in a few seconds and
low execution costs, this integration enables complex Bitcoin-based
decentralized applications that were not practically feasible or economically
viable before.

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了碳预算与用户体验和收入的关系。

Abstract: The carbon footprint of data centers has recently become a critical concern.
So far, most carbon-aware strategies have focused on leveraging the flexibility
of scheduling decisions for batch processing by shifting the time and location
of workload executions. However, such approaches cannot be applied to
service-oriented cloud applications, since they have to be reachable at every
point in time and often at low latencies. We propose a carbon-aware approach
for operating microservices under hourly carbon budgets. By choosing the most
appropriate version and horizontal scaleout for each microservice, our strategy
maximizes user experience and revenue while staying within budget constraints.
Experiments across various application configurations and carbon budgets
demonstrate that the approach adapts properly to changing workloads and carbon
intensities.

Abstract: Finding the optimal set of cloud resources to deploy a given workload at
minimal cost while meeting a defined service level agreement is an active area
of research. Combining tens of parameters applicable across a large selection
of compute, storage, and services offered by cloud providers with similar
numbers of application-specific parameters leads to configuration spaces with
millions of deployment options.
  In this paper, we propose Discovery Space, an abstraction that formalizes the
description of workload configuration problems, and exhibits a set of
characteristics required for structured, robust and distributed investigations
of large search spaces. We describe a concrete implementation of the Discovery
Space abstraction and show that it is generalizable across a diverse set of
workloads such as Large Language Model inference and Big Data Analytics.
  We demonstrate that our approach enables safe, transparent sharing of data
between executions of best-of-breed optimizers increasing the efficiency of

Abstract: The advent of 5G and beyond has brought increased performance networks,
facilitating the deployment of services closer to the user. To meet performance
requirements such services require specialized hardware, such as Field
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). However, FPGAs are often deployed in
unprotected environments, leaving the user's applications vulnerable to
multiple attacks. With the rise of quantum computing, which threatens the
integrity of widely-used cryptographic algorithms, the need for a robust
security infrastructure is even more crucial. In this paper we introduce a
hybrid hardware-software solution utilizing remote attestation to securely
configure FPGAs, while integrating Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) algorithms
for enhanced security. Additionally, to enable trustworthiness across the whole
edge computing continuum, our solution integrates a blockchain infrastructure,
ensuring the secure storage of any security evidence. We evaluate the proposed
secure configuration process under different PQC algorithms in two FPGA
families, showcasing only 2% overheard compared to the non PQC approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在图形学习中表现出色，但由于顶点间的不规则连接导致DRAM访问效率低下，影响性能。现有加速器设计未能完全解决这一问题。

Method: LiGNN引入了一种局部感知的特征dropout机制，并结合内存布局知识，在DRAM行级别合并内存访问。

Result: 在0.5的dropout率下，LiGNN实现了1.48~3.02倍的加速，DRAM访问减少34%~55%，行激活降低59%~82%，且保持模型精度。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in graph

irregular connectivity between vertices leads to inefficient neighbor
aggregation, resulting in substantial irregular and coarse-grained DRAM
accesses. This lack of data locality presents significant challenges for
execution platforms, ultimately degrading performance. While previous
accelerator designs have leveraged on-chip memory and data access scheduling
strategies to address this issue, they still inevitably access features at
irregular addresses from DRAM. In this work, we propose LiGNN, a hardware-based
solution that improves data locality by applying dropout and merge techniques
during neighbor aggregation to accelerate GNN training. Unlike conventional
algorithm-level dropout methods that primarily aim to improve accuracy while
overlooking hardware costs, LiGNN introduces a locality-aware feature dropout
mechanism. This approach selectively drops node features with data locality
awareness, effectively reducing irregular DRAM accesses without compromising
model accuracy. Moreover, by leveraging detailed knowledge of memory layout and
organization-including critical alignment constraints-LiGNN strategically
merges memory accesses during neighbor aggregation at the DRAM row level,
guided by GNN-level semantics. This optimization significantly improves data
locality with minimal additional cost. Under the commonly adopted 0.5 dropout
rate, LiGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering a 1.48~3.02x
speedup, reducing DRAM accesses by 34%~55%, and lowering DRAM row activations
by 59%~82%, all while maintaining model accuracy.

### [164] [OptGM: An Optimized Gate Merging Method to Mitigate NBTI in Digital Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21487)
*Maryam Ghane,Amir M. Hajisadeghi,Hamid R. Zarandi*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: OptGM是一种优化的门合并方法，用于减轻数字电路中的负偏压温度不稳定性（NBTI）。通过识别NBTI关键节点并合并相关门，显著减少了NBTI关键晶体管数量、延迟退化和总晶体管数，同时提升了性能成本比（PPC）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NBTI是数字电路中影响可靠性的重要问题，会导致晶体管性能退化。OptGM旨在通过优化门合并来缓解这一问题。

Method: 首先识别信号概率超过阈值的NBTI关键节点，然后合并驱动这些节点的门和被驱动的门，形成新的复杂门以消除关键节点。

Result: 实验表明，OptGM平均减少了89.29%的NBTI关键晶体管、23.87%的延迟退化和6.47%的总晶体管数，PPC提升12.8%。

Conclusion: OptGM有效缓解了NBTI问题，显著提升了电路性能和可靠性，且面积开销极小。

Abstract: This paper presents OptGM, an optimized gate merging method designed to
mitigate negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) in digital circuits.
First, the proposed approach effectively identifies NBTI-critical internal
nodes, defined as those with a signal probability exceeding a predefined
threshold. Next, based on the proposed optimized algorithm, the sensitizer gate
(which drives the critical node) and the sensitive gate (which is fed by it)
are merged into a new complex gate. This complex gate preserves the original
logic while eliminating NBTI-critical nodes. Finally, to evaluate the
effectiveness of OptGM, we assess it on several combinational and sequential
benchmark circuits. Simulation results demonstrate that, on average, the number
of NBTI-critical transistors (i.e., PMOS transistors connected to critical
nodes), NBTI-induced delay degradation, and the total transistor count are
reduced by 89.29%, 23.87%, and 6.47%, respectively. Furthermore, OptGM enhances
performance per cost (PPC) by 12.8% on average, with minimal area overhead.

*Alexander Selivanov,Philip Müller,Özgün Turgut,Nil Stolt-Ansó,Daniel Rückert*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PTACL是一种多模态对比学习框架，通过整合CMR的时空信息增强ECG表征，提升心脏功能评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG无法直接测量心脏功能参数，而CMR虽为金标准但昂贵且不易获取，PTACL旨在弥补这一差距。

Method: PTACL结合全局患者级和局部时间级对比损失，对齐ECG和CMR表征，无需新增可学习权重。

Result: 在UK Biobank数据上，PTACL在患者检索和心脏功能参数预测任务中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PTACL展示了通过ECG增强非侵入性心脏诊断的潜力。

Abstract: An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used, cost-effective tool for
detecting electrical abnormalities in the heart. However, it cannot directly
measure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection
fraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic
resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed
structural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To
bridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive
Learning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG
representations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses
global patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive
loss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and
CMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart
embeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal
alignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with
corresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations
with diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more
insights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without
introducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data
from 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL
achieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving
patients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac
function parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. Our
results highlight the potential of PTACL to enhance non-invasive cardiac
diagnostics using ECG. The code is available at:

Motivation: 自动化准确的心脏图像分割是心脏疾病诊断和管理的关键步骤，现有方法在精度和信息保留方面存在不足。

Method: 提出U-R-Veda模型，整合卷积变换、视觉变换器、残差连接、通道和空间注意力，以及边缘检测的跳跃连接，以减少信息损失并提升特征提取能力。

Result: 模型在DSC指标上达到95.2%的平均准确率，优于其他模型，尤其在右心室和左心室心肌的分割上表现突出。

Conclusion: U-R-Veda模型显著提升了心脏磁共振图像的语义分割精度，为医学图像分析提供了更可靠的自动化工具。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence, including deep learning models, will play a
transformative role in automated medical image analysis for the diagnosis of
cardiac disorders and their management. Automated accurate delineation of
cardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and
automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution
transformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and
spatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an
accurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships
using a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and
spatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep
embedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies
important features and their spatial localization. The combined edge
information with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces
information-loss during convolution transformations. The overall model
significantly improves the semantic segmentation of CMR images necessary for
improved medical image analysis. An algorithm for the dual attention module
(channel and spatial attention) has been presented. Performance results show
that U-R-Veda achieves an average accuracy of 95.2%, based on DSC metrics. The
model outperforms the accuracy attained by other models, based on DSC and HD
metrics, especially for the delineation of right-ventricle and
left-ventricle-myocardium.

Motivation: 解决静态磁场B0不均匀性对谱分析准确性的影响。

Method: 利用深度学习模型，训练基于B0图和健康人脑代谢物比率的模拟谱，并与实测谱进行视觉和定量评估。

Result: 模拟谱与实测谱接近，使用模拟谱训练的模型显著降低了代谢物比率的均方误差和绝对百分比误差。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过增加训练样本，有望提高谱分析的准确性。

Abstract: Purpose:To develop a method that enhances the accuracy of spectral analysis
in the presence of static magnetic field B0 inhomogeneity. Methods:The authors
proposed a new spectral analysis method utilizing a deep learning model trained
on modeled spectra that consistently represent the spectral variations induced
by B0 inhomogeneity. These modeled spectra were generated from the B0 map and
metabolite ratios of the healthy human brain. The B0 map was divided into a
patch size of subregions, and the separately estimated metabolites and baseline
components were averaged and then integrated. The quality of the modeled
spectra was visually and quantitatively evaluated against the measured spectra.
The analysis models were trained using measured, simulated, and modeled
spectra. The performance of the proposed method was assessed using mean squared
errors (MSEs) of metabolite ratios. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs)
of the metabolite ratios were also compared to LCModel when analyzing the
phantom spectra acquired under two types of B0 inhomogeneity. Results:The
modeled spectra exhibited broadened and narrowed spectral peaks depending on
the B0 inhomogeneity and were quantitatively close to the measured spectra. The
analysis model trained using measured spectra with modeled spectra improved
MSEs by 49.89% compared to that trained using measured spectra alone, and by
26.66% compared to that trained using measured spectra with simulated spectra.
The performance improved as the number of modeled spectra increased from 0 to
1,000. This model showed significantly lower MAPEs than LCModel under both
types of B0 inhomogeneity. Conclusion:A new spectral analysis-trained deep
learning model using the modeled spectra was developed. The results suggest
that the proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy of spectral
analysis by increasing the training samples of spectra.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于DCT域的JPEG质量增强方法（AJQE），通过利用DCT系数中的相关性，显著提升了性能并降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有JPEG质量增强方法多在像素域操作，计算成本高；而DCT域方法性能有限。

Method: 识别JPEG图像DCT系数中的两种关键相关性，提出AJQE方法，将像素域模型适配到DCT域。

Result: 与像素域方法相比，PSNR提升0.35 dB，增强吞吐量提高60.5%。

Conclusion: AJQE方法在DCT域实现了高效且高性能的JPEG质量增强。

Abstract: Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) achieves data compression by
quantizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients, which inevitably
introduces compression artifacts. Most existing JPEG quality enhancement
methods operate in the pixel domain, suffering from the high computational
costs of decoding. Consequently, direct enhancement of JPEG images in the DCT
domain has gained increasing attention. However, current DCT-domain methods
often exhibit limited performance. To address this challenge, we identify two
critical types of correlations within the DCT coefficients of JPEG images.
Building on this insight, we propose an Advanced DCT-domain JPEG Quality
Enhancement (AJQE) method that fully exploits these correlations. The AJQE
method enables the adaptation of numerous well-established pixel-domain models
to the DCT domain, achieving superior performance with reduced computational
complexity. Compared to the pixel-domain counterparts, the DCT-domain models
derived by our method demonstrate a 0.35 dB improvement in PSNR and a 60.5%
increase in enhancement throughput on average.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出一种零样本去噪框架，用于低角度CPWC成像，通过自监督学习提升图像对比度，无需额外训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPWC多角度传输虽提升图像质量，但会降低帧率并引入模糊伪影，且噪声问题在传输角度有限时尤为突出。

Method: 将传输角度分为两个子集生成含噪图像，通过自监督残差学习训练轻量级深度模型，分离噪声与组织信号。

Result: 在仿真、体模和活体数据上，相比传统和深度学习方法，展现出更优的对比度增强和结构保留能力。

Conclusion: 该框架无需领域微调或配对数据，计算成本低，适用于不同解剖区域和采集设置。

Abstract: Ultrasound Coherent Plane Wave Compounding (CPWC) enhances image contrast by
combining echoes from multiple steered transmissions. While increasing the
number of angles generally improves image quality, it drastically reduces the
frame rate and can introduce blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets.
Moreover, compounded images remain susceptible to noise, particularly when
acquired with a limited number of transmissions. We propose a zero-shot
denoising framework tailored for low-angle CPWC acquisitions, which enhances
contrast without relying on a separate training dataset. The method divides the
available transmission angles into two disjoint subsets, each used to form
compound images that include higher noise levels. The new compounded images are
then used to train a deep model via a self-supervised residual learning scheme,
enabling it to suppress incoherent noise while preserving anatomical
structures. Because angle-dependent artifacts vary between the subsets while
the underlying tissue response is similar, this physics-informed pairing allows
the network to learn to disentangle the inconsistent artifacts from the
consistent tissue signal. Unlike supervised methods, our model requires no
domain-specific fine-tuning or paired data, making it adaptable across
anatomical regions and acquisition setups. The entire pipeline supports
efficient training with low computational cost due to the use of a lightweight
architecture, which comprises only two convolutional layers. Evaluations on
simulation, phantom, and in vivo data demonstrate superior contrast enhancement
and structure preservation compared to both classical and deep learning-based
denoising methods.

Conclusion: 3D MLLMs在RRG中具有潜力，设计优化和知识增强方法能显著提升性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising way to
automate Radiology Report Generation (RRG). In this work, we systematically
investigate the design space of 3D MLLMs, including visual input

techniques for 3D CT report generation. We also introduce two knowledge-based
report augmentation methods that improve performance on the GREEN score by up
to 10\%, achieving the 2nd place on the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Our
results on the 1,687 cases from the AMOS-MM dataset show that RRG is largely
independent of the size of LLM under the same training protocol. We also show
that larger volume size does not always improve performance if the original ViT
was pre-trained on a smaller volume size. Lastly, we show that using a
segmentation mask along with the CT volume improves performance. The code is

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文研究了在低资源音乐类型（如印度斯坦古典音乐和土耳其Makam音乐）中，如何通过参数高效微调（PEFT）技术优化MusicGen和Mustango模型的适配器设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调大规模音乐生成模型（如MusicGen和Mustango）计算成本高，而PEFT技术（尤其是基于适配器的方法）能以较少的可训练参数实现模型适应，但适配器的设计选择多样，缺乏明确的最优方案。

Method: 研究了MusicGen和Mustango模型在两种音乐类型上的不同适配器配置，包括卷积和基于Transformer的适配器，并分析了其性能和资源需求。

Result: 卷积适配器擅长捕捉局部音乐细节，Transformer适配器更擅长保持长程依赖关系；中等规模适配器（40M参数）在表达性和质量间取得平衡；Mustango生成多样性更高但稳定性较差，MusicGen训练更快且质量更高。

Conclusion: 适配器设计需根据具体音乐类型和需求选择，卷积和Transformer适配器各有优势，中等规模适配器是资源与性能的折衷方案；Mustango和MusicGen各有优缺点，需权衡使用。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale music generation models, such as MusicGen and
Mustango, is a computationally expensive process, often requiring updates to
billions of parameters and, therefore, significant hardware resources.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly adapter-based
methods, have emerged as a promising alternative, enabling adaptation with
minimal trainable parameters while preserving model performance. However, the
design choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size,
are numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce
optimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this
paper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter
configurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres:
Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.
  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in
capturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short
melodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range
dependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze
computational resource requirements across different adapter scales,
demonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal
balance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a
diffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to
the description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in
notes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive
and requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive
models like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can
produce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher
redundancy in their generations.

Conclusion: 研究为低资源环境下的阿拉伯方言识别提供了基线，并建议未来采用更大标注数据集、自监督学习和Transformer等先进架构。

Abstract: Arabic dialect recognition presents a significant challenge in speech
technology due to the linguistic diversity of Arabic and the scarcity of large
annotated datasets, particularly for underrepresented dialects. This research
investigates hybrid modeling strategies that integrate classical signal
processing techniques with deep learning architectures to address this problem
in low-resource scenarios. Two hybrid models were developed and evaluated: (1)
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) combined with a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), and (2) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features combined with
a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The models were trained on a dialect-filtered
subset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset, with dialect labels assigned based
on speaker metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the MFCC + CNN
architecture achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 91.2% and
strong precision, recall, and F1-scores, significantly outperforming the
Wavelet + RNN configuration, which achieved an accuracy of 66.5%. These
findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging spectral features with
convolutional models for Arabic dialect recognition, especially when working
with limited labeled data. The study also identifies limitations related to
dataset size, potential regional overlaps in labeling, and model optimization,
providing a roadmap for future research. Recommendations for further
improvement include the adoption of larger annotated corpora, integration of
self-supervised learning techniques, and exploration of advanced neural
architectures such as Transformers. Overall, this research establishes a strong
baseline for future developments in Arabic dialect recognition within
resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: While end-to-end video-to-audio generation has greatly improved, producing
high-fidelity audio that authentically captures the nuances of visual content
remains challenging. Like professionals in the creative industries, such
generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual
dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present
\textbf{ThinkSound}, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for
videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages:
foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes,
interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and
targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a
multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning
that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce
\textbf{AudioCoT}, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning
annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual
descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both
audio metrics and CoT metrics and excels in out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio
benchmark. The demo page is available at https://ThinkSound-Demo.github.io.

Motivation: 2D和3D设备级PIC模拟的高计算成本需要并行化，但传统方法因频繁的粒子-网格交互导致电荷沉积子程序成为瓶颈，且面临可扩展性问题。

Method: 采用粒子-线程绑定策略，每个节点仅需四个私有网格（分布式内存系统）或四个私有网格（共享内存系统），确保网格数据结构的完全可访问性，并通过附加功能和标志避免对同一单元格中粒子的同时访问。

Result: 在共享内存和分布式内存系统（1000核）上的性能评估表明，该方法具有高可扩展性和低硬件依赖性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了PIC模拟的可扩展性和性能，同时保持代码兼容性和低硬件依赖性。

Abstract: The Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method for plasma simulation tracks particle phase
space information using particle and grid data structures. High computational
costs in 2D and 3D device-scale PIC simulations necessitate parallelization,
with the Charge Deposition (CD) subroutine often becoming a bottleneck due to
frequent particle-grid interactions. Conventional methods mitigate dependencies
by generating private grids for each core, but this approach faces scalability
issues. We propose a novel approach based on a particle-thread binding strategy
that requires only four private grids per node in distributed memory systems or
four private grids in shared memory systems, enhancing CD scalability and
performance while maintaining conventional data structures and requiring
minimal changes to existing PIC codes. This method ensures complete
accessibility of grid data structure for concurrent threads and avoids
simultaneous access to particles within the same cell using additional
functions and flags. Performance evaluations using a PIC benchmark for
low-temperature partially magnetized E x B discharge simulation on a shared
memory as well as a distributed memory system (1000 cores) demonstrate the
method's scalability, and additionally, we show the method has little hardware
dependency.

Method: 提出了MAGPIE基准测试，包含158个高风险场景，评估LLM代理对隐私的理解和协作能力。

Result: 现有模型（如GPT-4o和Claude-2.7-Sonnet）在隐私分类和多轮对话中表现不佳，隐私泄露率高。

Conclusion: 当前模型在上下文隐私保护和协作任务完成方面存在不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of
inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource
allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access
proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict
confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an
understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems
preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn
conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents
primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information
can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158
real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed
such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet
unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then
evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of
contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without
violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,
including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual
privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the
time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in
59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.
Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios.
These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both
contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.

Method: 提出了一个概念验证框架，模拟模型建议在社会系统中的传播，并引入了一个包含100个间接危害场景的数据集。

Result: 新数据集上性能提升超过20%，在现有安全基准测试中平均胜率超过70%。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发更安全的语言模型代理提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes
societal decisions, from public policy to healthcare, ensuring their beneficial
impact requires understanding the far-reaching implications of their
suggestions. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that projects how
model-generated advice could propagate through societal systems on a
macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the
long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of
100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models' ability to foresee adverse,
non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach
achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average
win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks
(AdvBench, SafeRLHF, WildGuardMix), suggesting a promising direction for safer
agents.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的因果推理能力，发现其仅能进行浅层（level-1）推理，缺乏人类般的深层（level-2）能力。通过新基准测试CausalProbe-2024验证，并提出G^2-Reasoner方法以提升LLMs的因果推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否具备类似人类的真实因果推理能力，发现其当前仅能进行浅层推理，需改进以实现深层推理。

Method: 分析LLMs的自回归机制，提出新基准CausalProbe-2024测试其能力，并设计G^2-Reasoner方法结合通用知识和目标导向提示。

Result: LLMs在CausalProbe-2024上表现显著下降，验证其仅能进行level-1推理；G^2-Reasoner显著提升其在新鲜和反事实场景中的推理能力。

Conclusion: LLMs当前缺乏深层因果推理能力，但通过结合通用知识和目标导向的方法（如G^2-Reasoner）可推动其向level-2推理迈进。

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models
(LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to
have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and
providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether
they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence
indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing
shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal
knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine
human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,
methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of
transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.
Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,
whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs
exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier
benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal
reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw
inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by
general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that
incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal
reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly
enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and
counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to
advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making
strides towards level-2.

TL;DR: MindCube基准测试揭示了现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在构建空间心理模型方面的不足，提出了一种协同方法“map-then-reason”，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs是否能像人类一样通过少量视角构建完整场景的空间心理模型，以推理布局、视角和运动。

Method: 使用MindCube基准测试评估VLMs的空间心理模型能力，并提出三种方法（中间视角、自然语言推理链、认知地图），最终采用“map-then-reason”协同方法。

Result: 通过“map-then-reason”方法，准确率从37.8%提升至60.8%；结合强化学习后进一步提升至70.7%。

Conclusion: 构建和利用内部结构化空间表示的空间心理模型支架，显著提升了对不可见空间的理解能力。

Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few
views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal
representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and
motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images
exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.
Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial
mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations
(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements).
We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental
models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,
and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic
approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a
cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these
internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding
reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our
key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively
constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with
flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of
unobservable space.

Motivation: 现有评估方法无法应对自主代理搜索的复杂性和开放性，亟需新的基准和方法。

Method: 构建Mind2Web 2基准，包含130个长周期任务；提出Agent-as-a-Judge框架，基于树状评分标准设计任务特定的评分代理。

Result: OpenAI Deep Research系统表现最佳，达到人类性能的50-70%，耗时减半。

Conclusion: Mind2Web 2为下一代自主代理搜索系统的开发和评估提供了严格基础。

Abstract: Agentic search such as Deep Research systems, where large language models
autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive
citation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with
web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive
offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have
outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume
short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web
2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that
require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed
with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating
time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge
framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a
tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness
and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier
agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error
analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,
OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while
spending half the time, showing a great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2
provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next
generation of agentic search systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在纹理一致性和编辑灵活性上存在不足，需要一种能够支持多尺度编辑并保持对象身份的方法。

Method: 将场景表示为3D凸基元的组合，支持不同数量的基元表示同一场景；编辑后，基于深度和纹理提示的流式方法生成图像，纹理提示考虑了修改后的3D基元。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法在视觉保真度、可编辑性和组合泛化性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过3D基元和纹理提示的结合，实现了高效的场景编辑和高质量的图像生成。

Abstract: We describe Generative Blocks World to interact with the scene of a generated
image by manipulating simple geometric abstractions. Our method represents
scenes as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, and the same scene can be
represented by different numbers of primitives, allowing an editor to move
either whole structures or small details. Once the scene geometry has been
edited, the image is generated by a flow-based method which is conditioned on
depth and a texture hint. Our texture hint takes into account the modified 3D
primitives, exceeding texture-consistency provided by existing key-value
caching techniques. These texture hints (a) allow accurate object and camera
moves and (b) largely preserve the identity of objects depicted. Quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
works in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization.

Motivation: 现有方法将头发和面部建模纠缠在一起，限制了模型的灵活性和可编辑性。3DGH旨在通过分离建模提升生成效果和编辑能力。

Method: 提出基于模板的3D高斯溅射数据表示，引入可变形头发几何体；设计双生成器3D GAN架构，采用交叉注意力机制建模头发与面部的相关性。

Conclusion: 3DGH通过分离头发和面部建模，提升了生成和编辑能力，为3D人头合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present 3DGH, an unconditional generative model for 3D human heads with
composable hair and face components. Unlike previous work that entangles the
modeling of hair and face, we propose to separate them using a novel data
representation with template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting, in which deformable
hair geometry is introduced to capture the geometric variations across
different hairstyles. Based on this data representation, we design a 3D
GAN-based architecture with dual generators and employ a cross-attention
mechanism to model the inherent correlation between hair and face. The model is
trained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to
stabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation. We conduct extensive
experiments to validate the design choice of 3DGH, and evaluate it both
qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing with several state-of-the-art 3D
GAN methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in unconditional full-head image
synthesis and composable 3D hairstyle editing. More details will be available

Conclusion: VideoTex为动态实时应用提供了高质量的时空一致纹理合成方案。

Abstract: Current texture synthesis methods, which generate textures from fixed
viewpoints, suffer from inconsistencies due to the lack of global context and
geometric understanding. Meanwhile, recent advancements in video generation
models have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving temporally consistent
videos. In this paper, we introduce VideoTex, a novel framework for seamless
texture synthesis that leverages video generation models to address both
spatial and temporal inconsistencies in 3D textures. Our approach incorporates
geometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures.
Additionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances
the generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting
in smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother
transitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally
stable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and
stability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both
visual quality and temporal coherence.

TL;DR: FairyGen是一个自动系统，能从单张儿童绘画生成故事驱动的卡通视频，并保留其独特的艺术风格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注角色一致性和基本动作，而FairyGen旨在通过分离角色建模与风格化背景生成，并结合电影镜头设计，实现更具表现力和连贯性的故事讲述。

Method: 系统使用MLLM生成结构化故事板，引入风格传播适配器确保视觉一致性，并通过镜头设计模块增强视觉多样性和电影质量。角色动画通过3D代理重建和MMDiT图像到视频扩散模型实现。

Result: 实验表明，FairyGen生成的动画风格忠实、叙事结构自然，具有个性化且引人入胜的潜力。

Conclusion: FairyGen为个性化故事动画提供了高效且创新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose FairyGen, an automatic system for generating story-driven cartoon
videos from a single child's drawing, while faithfully preserving its unique
artistic style. Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on
character consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles
character modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates
cinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a
single character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured
storyboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,
character actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we
introduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual
style and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's
full visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design
module further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame
cropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the
story, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically
plausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based
image-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion
customization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from
temporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second
stage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen
identity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent
video scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful,
narratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for
personalized and engaging story animation. The code will be available at

Abstract: Visualizations are crucial for data communication, yet understanding them
requires comprehension of both visual elements and their underlying data

address these challenges, we present a novel dataset and train multimodal

combines chart images with their corresponding vectorized representations,

Abstract: Everyday, a vast stream of research documents is submitted to conferences,
anthologies, journals, newsletters, annual reports, daily papers, and various
periodicals. Many such publications use independent external specialists to
review submissions. This process is called peer review, and the reviewers are
called referees. However, it is not always possible to pick the best referee
for reviewing. Moreover, new research fields are emerging in every sector, and
the number of research papers is increasing dramatically. To review all these
papers, every journal assigns a small team of referees who may not be experts
in all areas. For example, a research paper in communication technology should
be reviewed by an expert from the same field. Thus, efficiently selecting the
best reviewer or referee for a research paper is a big challenge.
  In this research, we propose and implement program that uses a new strategy
to automatically select the best reviewers for a research paper. Every research
paper contains references at the end, usually from the same area. First, we
collect the references and count authors who have at least one paper in the
references. Then, we automatically browse the web to extract research topic
keywords. Next, we search for top researchers in the specific topic and count
their h-index, i10-index, and citations for the first n authors. Afterward, we
rank the top n authors based on a score and automatically browse their
homepages to retrieve email addresses. We also check their co-authors and
colleagues online and discard them from the list. The remaining top n authors,
generally professors, are likely the best referees for reviewing the research
paper.

Motivation: AF3在蛋白质结构预测方面取得了突破，但其训练过程因计算和内存密集型操作、2D注意力机制和数据管道等问题而难以扩展。MegaFold旨在解决这些瓶颈问题。

Method: MegaFold采用提前缓存消除GPU空闲时间，使用Triton内核实现高效EvoAttention，并通过深度融合优化小操作符。

Result: 在NVIDIA H200和AMD MI250 GPU上，MegaFold将AF3训练的峰值内存使用降低1.23倍，训练速度提升1.73倍和1.62倍，并支持处理1.35倍更长的序列。

Conclusion: MegaFold显著提升了AF3训练的可扩展性和效率，为现代蛋白质折叠模型的进一步发展提供了支持。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models such as AlphaFold3 (AF3) push the
frontier of biomolecular modeling by incorporating science-informed
architectural changes to the transformer architecture. However, these advances
come at a steep system cost, introducing: compute- and memory-intensive
operators, 2D attention mechanisms, and retrieval-augmented data pipelines,
which collectively hinder the scalability of AF3 training. In this work, we
present MegaFold, a cross-platform system to accelerate AF3 training. MegaFold
tackles key bottlenecks through ahead-of-time caching to eliminate GPU idle
time from the retrieval-augmented data pipeline, Triton-based kernels for
memory-efficient EvoAttention on heterogeneous devices, and deep fusion for
common and critical small operators in AF3. Evaluation on both NVIDIA H200 and
AMD MI250 GPUs shows that MegaFold reduces peak memory usage of AF3 training by
up to 1.23$\times$ and improves per-iteration training time by up-to
1.73$\times$ and 1.62$\times$ respectively. More importantly, MegaFold enables
training on 1.35$\times$ longer sequence lengths compared to PyTorch baselines
without running out-of-memory, significantly improving the scalability of
modern protein folding models. We open source our code at

Conclusion: 该方法对异常点的容忍度是有效导体测量值的两倍，适用于复杂环境下的电力线检测。

Abstract: Drones can inspect overhead power lines while they remain energized,
significantly simplifying the inspection process. However, localizing a drone
relative to all conductors using an onboard LiDAR sensor presents several
challenges: (1) conductors provide minimal surface for LiDAR beams limiting the
number of conductor points in a scan, (2) not all conductors are consistently
detected, and (3) distinguishing LiDAR points corresponding to conductors from
other objects, such as trees and pylons, is difficult. This paper proposes an
estimation approach that minimizes the error between LiDAR measurements and a
single geometric model representing the entire conductor array, rather than
tracking individual conductors separately. Experimental results, using data
from a power line drone inspection, demonstrate that this method achieves
accurate tracking, with a solver converging under 50 ms per frame, even in the
presence of partial observations, noise, and outliers. A sensitivity analysis
shows that the estimation approach can tolerate up to twice as many outlier
points as valid conductors measurements.

Abstract: Autonomous systems rely on sensors to estimate the environment around them.
However, cameras, LiDARs, and RADARs have their own limitations. In nighttime
or degraded environments such as fog, mist, or dust, thermal cameras can
provide valuable information regarding the presence of objects of interest due
to their heat signature. They make it easy to identify humans and vehicles that
are usually at higher temperatures compared to their surroundings. In this
paper, we focus on the adaptation of thermal cameras for robotics and
automation, where the biggest hurdle is the lack of data. Several multi-modal
datasets are available for driving robotics research in tasks such as scene
segmentation, object detection, and depth estimation, which are the cornerstone
of autonomous systems. However, they are found to be lacking in thermal
imagery. Our paper proposes a solution to augment these datasets with synthetic
thermal data to enable widespread and rapid adaptation of thermal cameras. We
explore the use of conditional diffusion models to convert existing RGB images
to thermal images using self-attention to learn the thermal properties of
real-world objects.

Conclusion: V2X-REALM推动了端到端协作自动驾驶的可扩展性，适用于复杂挑战性驾驶条件。

Abstract: Ensuring robust planning and decision-making under rare, diverse, and
visually degraded long-tail scenarios remains a fundamental challenge for
autonomous driving in urban environments. This issue becomes more critical in
cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and
reason across complex environments. To address this challenge, we propose
V2X-REALM, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework with adaptive
multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail
scenarios. V2X-REALM introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven
long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation
models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across
vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity
efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that
modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or
corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning
objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario
feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V2X-REALM
significantly outperforms existing baselines in robustness, semantic reasoning,
safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions,
advancing the scalability of end-to-end cooperative autonomous driving.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了微前端架构在工业场景中的适用性，通过案例研究发现其虽能提升团队独立性和可扩展性，但并非总是必要选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究微前端架构的适用性，特别是在工业环境中，以解决紧耦合、技术过差和开发者体验差的问题。

Method: 结合学术和灰色文献研究微前端现状，并在一个手工艺品市场平台实施该架构，通过半开放式问卷评估开发者反馈。

Result: 微前端架构成功实施，但研究发现其他替代方案（如单体前端）也能达到类似效果，其优势在于与微服务架构的兼容性。

Conclusion: 微前端架构在特定场景（如已有微服务基础设施）下更具优势，但需权衡其复杂性和必要性。

Abstract: In the micro frontends architectural style, the frontend is divided into
smaller components, which can range from a simple button to an entire page. The
goal is to improve scalability, resilience, and team independence, albeit at
the cost of increased complexity and infrastructure demands. This paper seeks
to understand when it is worth adopting micro frontends, particularly in the
context of industry. To achieve this, we conducted an investigation into the
state of the art of micro frontends, based on both academic and gray
literature. We then implemented this architectural style in a marketplace for
handcrafted products, which already used microservices. Finally, we evaluated
the implementation through a semi-open questionnaire with the developers. At
the studied marketplace company, the need for architectural change arose due to
the tight coupling between their main system (a Java monolith) and a dedicated
frontend system. Additionally, there were deprecated technologies and poor
developer experience. To address these issues, the micro frontends architecture
was adopted, along with the API Gateway and Backend for Frontend patterns, and
technologies such as Svelte and Fastify. Although the adoption of Micro
Frontends was successful, it was not strictly necessary to meet the company's
needs. According to the analysis of the mixed questionnaire responses, other
alternatives, such as a monolithic frontend, could have achieved comparable
results. What made adopting micro frontends the most convenient choice in the
company's context was the monolith strangulation and microservices adoption,
which facilitated implementation through infrastructure reuse and knowledge
sharing between teams.

*Fu Peng,Meng Zhang,Ming Tang*

TL;DR: 该论文研究了联邦学习（FL）在数据流分布变化（概念漂移）下的性能问题，提出了一种基于信息理论的算法来缓解性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据通常是动态的，而现有的FL研究多基于静态数据集，导致模型在概念漂移下性能下降。

Method: 通过将概念漂移建模为马尔可夫链，提出“稳态泛化误差”评估模型对未来数据的适应能力，并设计了一种结合KL散度和互信息的正则化算法。

Result: 实验验证了三种漂移模式（周期性、渐进性和随机性）对FL性能的影响，提出的算法在性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该算法能有效适应概念漂移，提升FL的长期性能，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent studies in federated learning (FL) commonly train models on static
datasets. However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting
distributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This
paper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and
proposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept
drift as a Markov chain and introduce the \emph{Stationary Generalization
Error} to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future
unseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual
information. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and
their impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that
regularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and
mutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore
the performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our
approach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental
results corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns
significantly affect performance. Our method consistently outperforms existing
approaches for these three patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
adapting concept drift in FL.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在微调中的记忆问题，特别是LoRA微调的影响。

Method: 使用基于相似性的记忆度量，比较不同微调策略（如LoRA和全微调）的记忆风险。

Result: LoRA微调在减少记忆风险方面优于全微调，且不影响任务性能。

Conclusion: LoRA微调是一种更安全的参数高效方法，适用于减少记忆风险。

Abstract: Memorization in large language models (LLMs) makes them vulnerable to data
extraction attacks. While pre-training memorization has been extensively
studied, fewer works have explored its impact in fine-tuning, particularly for
LoRA fine-tuning, a widely adopted parameter-efficient method.
  In this work, we re-examine memorization in fine-tuning and uncover a
surprising divergence from prior findings across different fine-tuning
strategies. Factors such as model scale and data duplication, which strongly
influence memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not follow the
same trend in LoRA fine-tuning. Using a more relaxed similarity-based
memorization metric, we demonstrate that LoRA significantly reduces
memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, while still maintaining strong
task performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SharpZO的混合优化方法，通过锐度感知预热训练提升零阶优化的视觉语言模型微调性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统基于梯度的微调方法在内存受限的边缘设备上不可行的问题，同时克服现有零阶优化方法性能不足的缺陷。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：锐度感知进化策略阶段全局探索和平滑损失景观，稀疏零阶优化阶段进行细粒度局部搜索。

Result: 在CLIP模型上实验表明，SharpZO显著提升准确性和收敛速度，平均性能提升7%。

Conclusion: SharpZO为边缘设备上的视觉语言模型微调提供了一种高效的无梯度优化方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance
across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients
through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained,
inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has
explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often
rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this
paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO)
approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM
fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a
two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally
explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization,
followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire
optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and
extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly
improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over
state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用知识图谱生成高质量指令数据的方法，以提升大语言模型（LLMs）的工具使用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升LLMs的工具使用能力需要高质量的指令数据，但现有方法生成的数据质量不足。

Method: 从知识图谱中提取查询路径，转化为用户查询，并将实体关系转化为可操作工具，生成高质量指令数据。

Result: 实验表明，仅需少量合成数据微调即可显著提升LLMs的工具使用能力。

Conclusion: 知识图谱生成的指令数据能有效提升LLMs的工具使用和整体能力。

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to use tools is crucial for improving
their problem-solving abilities and expanding their applications. However,
effectively using tools is challenging because it requires a deep understanding
of tool functionalities and user intentions. Previous methods relied mainly on
LLMs to generate instruction data, but the quality of these data was often
insufficient. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses knowledge graphs
to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs. Knowledge graphs are
manually curated datasets rich in semantic information. We begin by extracting
various query pathways from a given knowledge graph, which are transformed into
a broad spectrum of user queries. We then translate the relationships between
entities into actionable tools and parse the pathways of each query into
detailed solution steps, thereby creating high-quality instruction data. Our
experiments show that fine-tuning on just a small sample of this synthetic data
can significantly improve the tool utilization and overall capabilities of
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于中间层冗余性高的观察，尝试通过动态跳过中间层来提升Transformer的效率。

Method: 使用学习门控机制动态跳过对称的中间层，并通过门控注意力机制防止后续令牌关注跳过的位置。

Result: 在研究的规模下，未能比密集基线模型更好地权衡验证交叉熵与FLOPs。

Conclusion: 动态跳过中间层的方法在当前规模下效果有限，但代码已开源。

Abstract: Conditional computation is a popular strategy to make Transformers more
efficient. Existing methods often target individual modules (e.g.,
mixture-of-experts layers) or skip layers independently of one another.
However, interpretability research has demonstrated that the middle layers of
Transformers exhibit greater redundancy, and that early layers aggregate
information into token positions. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel
architecture that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle
outward. In particular, a learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass
a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input, and a gated attention
mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions.
Residual norms are controlled with a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme and
gate sparsity with an adaptive regularization loss. We had aimed to reduce
compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and potentially foster an emergent
multi-level representational hierarchy but, at the scales investigated, our
approach does not achieve improvements in the trade-off between validation
cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer
layers. We release our code at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过优化微调过程，减少对昂贵数据和计算资源的需求，同时保持性能。

Method: 利用熵分类数据复杂度，结合SFT和蒸馏方法进行微调。

Result: 在3B模型上，性能优于标准SFT（0.55 vs 0.43），且数据用量减少62%。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且性能优越，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned
through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific
domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a
larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount
of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses
reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across two
small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity
categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large
language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline
significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.55$ vs $0.43$ average
accuracy) and provides comparable with distillation performance while using
$62\%$ less data ($0.55$ average accuracy for both). We publish our code and
data to facilitate further research in this direction.

Motivation: 解决在慢速网络上训练超大规模模型（如100B参数以上）的挑战，释放去中心化集群的潜力。

Method: 结合Pipeline Parallelism、Dual Optimizer Policy、One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local Training，以及Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme。

Result: 成功在1Gbps网络上预训练107B模型，相比AllReduce实现357倍加速，且模型收敛几乎无退化。

Conclusion: DiLoCoX是首个成功应用于100B参数以上模型的去中心化训练框架。

Abstract: The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language
models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is
highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects.
Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of
decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion
parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale
decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with
Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local
Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination
significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model
pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of
communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression
scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model
over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x
speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in
model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100
billion parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MoE系统存在严重的负载不平衡问题，导致模型容量和计算资源利用率低下。

Method: 采用聚类视角提出LPR框架，推广现有方法并促进专家负载平衡。

Result: 实验表明，LPR将专家负载的基尼系数从0.70降至0.035，最小-最大专家负载比从1e-6提升至0.70，实现近乎完美的负载平衡。

Conclusion: LPR是一种有效的路由框架，能够在保持下游性能的同时显著改善MoE系统的负载平衡。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a key strategy for
scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, current MoE systems
suffer from severe load imbalance, where only a small subset of experts is
consistently activated during training and inference, leading to significant
underutilization of model capacity and computational resources. In this work,
we revisit expert routing through a clustering perspective and propose Latent
Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework that generalizes existing
approaches while promoting balanced expert utilization without compromising
downstream performance. Extensive experiments across multiple open-source MoE
models -- including DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-MoE, and Mixtral -- demonstrate that LPR
reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 on average,
improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving
near-perfect load balancing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）存在幻觉和校准不足的问题，在高风险领域（如自主系统和医疗）中，量化其不确定性至关重要。现有方法因参数过多难以扩展。

Method: 在LoRA秩为r的子空间中进行贝叶斯推理，利用LoRA参数作为投影矩阵，将子空间样本映射到LLM的完整权重空间，使用随机变分推理学习所有参数。

Result: 尽管子空间维度低，ScalaBL性能与最先进方法相当，仅需约1000额外参数，并成功扩展到迄今为止最大的贝叶斯LLM。

Conclusion: ScalaBL提供了一种高效且可扩展的方法，用于量化LLM的不确定性，适用于大规模模型。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, large language models (LLMs) are known to
hallucinate incorrect information and be poorly calibrated. This makes the
uncertainty quantification of these models of critical importance, especially
in high-stakes domains, such as autonomy and healthcare. Prior work has made
Bayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by
performing inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a
fine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger
LLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA. In this
work we present $\textbf{Scala}$ble $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{L}$ow-Rank
Adaptation via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference (ScalaBL). We perform
Bayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By
repurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map
samples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM. This allows
us to learn all the parameters of our approach using stochastic variational
inference. Despite the low dimensionality of our subspace, we are able to
achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while only
requiring ${\sim}1000$ additional parameters. Furthermore, it allows us to
scale up to the largest Bayesian LLM to date, with four times as a many base
parameters as prior work.

Result: 方法高效、实时兼容，适用于多种DNN架构和领域（如图像、视频、音频）。

Conclusion: 该方法在对抗样本检测中表现出高效性和通用性，适用于实时处理和多领域应用。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial input
designs with limited noise budgets. While numerous successful attacks with
subtle modifications to original input have been proposed, defense techniques
against these attacks are relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches
either focus on improving DNN robustness by negating the effects of
perturbations or use a secondary model to detect adversarial data. Although
equally important, the attack detection approach, which is studied in this
work, provides a more practical defense compared to the robustness approach. We
show that the existing detection methods are either ineffective against the
state-of-the-art attack techniques or computationally inefficient for real-time
processing. We propose a novel universal and efficient method to detect
adversarial examples by analyzing the varying degrees of impact of attacks on
different DNN layers. {Our method trains a lightweight regression model that
predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the
prediction error to detect adversarial samples.} Through theoretical arguments
and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly
effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, compatible with
any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image,
video, and audio.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模数据集训练带来高计算和存储开销，而现实数据中存在冗余，需要更高效的数据选择方法以减少成本。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和架构上，RL-Selector优于现有方法，提升模型泛化性能和训练效率。

Conclusion: RL-Selector通过动态数据选择有效减少冗余，显著提升训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on
these datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world
datasets often contain substantial redundancies, prompting the need for more
data-efficient training paradigms. Data selection has shown promise to mitigate
redundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing
training costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically
rely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined
effect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We
introduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample
redundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic
structure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a
reinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a
lightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging
epsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward
signal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse
architectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art baselines. Models trained with our selected datasets show
enhanced generalization performance with improved training efficiency.

Conclusion: pFedDC通过双提示学习和交叉融合有效解决了联邦学习中的异构性问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by
heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight
tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated
prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint
label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL
framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC.
Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision
and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across
the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain
characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively
integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate
personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data
distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of
heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods.
