### [1] [EvidenceOutcomes: a Dataset of Clinical Trial Publications with Clinically Meaningful Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05380)
*Yiliang Zhou,Abigail M. Newbury,Gongbo Zhang,Betina Ross Idnay,Hao Liu,Chunhua Weng,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了EvidenceOutcomes，一个从生物医学文献中提取临床有意义结果的新型标注语料库，填补了现有基准中结果元素被忽视或简化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在循证医学中，结果（Outcome）是最复杂的PICO元素之一，但现有基准常忽视或简化其标注。

Method: 通过迭代和临床医生与NLP专家的讨论，制定了标注指南，并由三名独立标注者对500篇PubMed摘要和140篇EBM-NLP摘要的结果和结论部分进行标注。

Result: 标注语料库EvidenceOutcomes的标注质量高，标注者间一致性为0.76；基于PubMedBERT的模型在实体和标记级别分别达到0.69和0.76的F1分数。

Conclusion: EvidenceOutcomes可作为未来机器学习算法开发和测试的共享基准，用于从生物医学摘要中提取临床有意义的结果。

Abstract: The fundamental process of evidence extraction and synthesis in
evidence-based medicine involves extracting PICO (Population, Intervention,
Comparison, and Outcome) elements from biomedical literature. However,
Outcomes, being the most complex elements, are often neglected or
oversimplified in existing benchmarks. To address this issue, we present
EvidenceOutcomes, a novel, large, annotated corpus of clinically meaningful
outcomes extracted from biomedical literature. We first developed a robust
annotation guideline for extracting clinically meaningful outcomes from text
through iteration and discussion with clinicians and Natural Language
Processing experts. Then, three independent annotators annotated the Results
and Conclusions sections of a randomly selected sample of 500 PubMed abstracts
and 140 PubMed abstracts from the existing EBM-NLP corpus. This resulted in
EvidenceOutcomes with high-quality annotations of an inter-rater agreement of
0.76. Additionally, our fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, applied to these 500
PubMed abstracts, achieved an F1-score of 0.69 at the entity level and 0.76 at
the token level on the subset of 140 PubMed abstracts from the EBM-NLP corpus.
EvidenceOutcomes can serve as a shared benchmark to develop and test future
machine learning algorithms to extract clinically meaningful outcomes from
biomedical abstracts.

### [2] [LLMs Can Also Do Well! Breaking Barriers in Semantic Role Labeling via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05385)
*Xinxin Li,Huiyao Chen,Chengjun Liu,Jing Li,Meishan Zhang,Jun Yu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过引入检索增强生成和自我纠正机制，使生成式解码器大语言模型（LLM）在语义角色标注（SRL）任务中首次超越编码器-解码器模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成式解码器大语言模型（LLM）在多种自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但在语义角色标注（SRL）任务中仍落后于编码器-解码器模型（如BERT）。本文旨在缩小这一差距。

Method: 提出两种机制：(a)检索增强生成，利用外部语言知识；(b)自我纠正，识别并修正不一致的SRL输出。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的SRL基准测试（CPB1.0、CoNLL-2009和CoNLL-2012）中，该方法在中文和英文上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 这是LLM首次在SRL任务中超越编码器-解码器模型，展示了其在复杂语言任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a crucial task of natural language processing
(NLP). Although generative decoder-based large language models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, they still lag behind
state-of-the-art encoder-decoder (BERT-like) models in SRL. In this work, we
seek to bridge this gap by equipping LLMs for SRL with two mechanisms: (a)
retrieval-augmented generation and (b) self-correction. The first mechanism
enables LLMs to leverage external linguistic knowledge such as predicate and
argument structure descriptions, while the second allows LLMs to identify and
correct inconsistent SRL outputs. We conduct extensive experiments on three
widely-used benchmarks of SRL (CPB1.0, CoNLL-2009, and CoNLL-2012). Results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
Chinese and English, marking the first successful application of LLMs to
surpass encoder-decoder approaches in SRL.

### [3] [Beyond RAG: Reinforced Reasoning Augmented Generation for Clinical Notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05386)
*Lo Pang-Yun Ting,Chengshuai Zhao,Yu-Hua Zeng,Yuan Jee Lim,Kun-Ta Chuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2AG是一种基于强化学习的检索器，用于从入院前数据生成长篇出院指导，通过检索医学知识图谱的推理路径为LLM提供语义指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的方法在生成长篇临床笔记时表现不足，尤其是输入信息有限时。

Method: 提出R2AG，结合强化学习和GRO方法优化检索质量，提升LLM的推理能力。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV-Note数据集上，R2AG在临床效果和自然语言生成指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: R2AG能填补稀疏输入场景的语义空白，帮助LLM避免临床误解。

Abstract: Clinical note generation aims to automatically produce free-text summaries of
a patient's condition and diagnostic process, with discharge instructions being
a representative long-form example. While recent large language model
(LLM)-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in
clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from
limited patient information. In this paper, we propose R2AG, the first
reinforced retriever for long-form discharge instruction generation based on
pre-admission data. R2AG is trained with reinforcement learning to retrieve
reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, providing explicit semantic
guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose Group-Based
Retriever Optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with
group-relative rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the
LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset show that R2AG
outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation
metrics. Further analysis reveals that R2AG fills semantic gaps in sparse input
scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical
misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.

### [4] [Advancing Decoding Strategies: Enhancements in Locally Typical Sampling for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05387)
*Jaydip Sen,Saptarshi Sengupta. Subhasis Dasgupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的局部典型采样算法（ASTS），通过动态熵阈值、多目标评分和奖励-惩罚调整，提升了文本生成的流畅性、多样性和连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统解码方法（如top-k和核采样）在平衡文本生成的流畅性、多样性和连贯性方面存在不足，因此需要改进。

Method: 提出了自适应语义感知典型性采样（ASTS），结合动态熵阈值、多目标评分和奖励-惩罚调整。

Result: ASTS在多个基准测试中表现优于现有采样技术，减少了重复，增强了语义对齐和流畅性。

Conclusion: ASTS是一种高效且有效的解码策略，适用于需要高质量文本生成的任务。

Abstract: This chapter explores advancements in decoding strategies for large language
models (LLMs), focusing on enhancing the Locally Typical Sampling (LTS)
algorithm. Traditional decoding methods, such as top-k and nucleus sampling,
often struggle to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation.
To address these challenges, Adaptive Semantic-Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS)
is proposed as an improved version of LTS, incorporating dynamic entropy
thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments. ASTS
ensures contextually coherent and diverse text generation while maintaining
computational efficiency. Its performance is evaluated across multiple
benchmarks, including story generation and abstractive summarization, using
metrics such as perplexity, MAUVE, and diversity scores. Experimental results
demonstrate that ASTS outperforms existing sampling techniques by reducing
repetition, enhancing semantic alignment, and improving fluency.

### [5] [taz2024full: Analysing German Newspapers for Gender Bias and Discrimination across Decades](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05388)
*Stefanie Urchs,Veronika Thurner,Matthias Aßenmacher,Christian Heumann,Stephanie Thiemichen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了taz2024full，这是迄今为止最大的公开德语报纸文章语料库，包含1980年至2024年的180多万篇文章，并展示了其在性别偏见研究中的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德语大规模语料资源有限，限制了语言趋势和社会问题（如性别偏见）的研究。

Method: 构建了taz2024full语料库，并通过可扩展的结构化分析管道分析性别代表性。

Result: 研究发现男性在报道中被过度代表，但近年来逐渐趋向更平衡的报道。

Conclusion: 该语料库支持多种应用，促进德语NLP的包容性和可重复性研究。

Abstract: Open-access corpora are essential for advancing natural language processing
(NLP) and computational social science (CSS). However, large-scale resources
for German remain limited, restricting research on linguistic trends and
societal issues such as gender bias. We present taz2024full, the largest
publicly available corpus of German newspaper articles to date, comprising over
1.8 million texts from taz, spanning 1980 to 2024.
  As a demonstration of the corpus's utility for bias and discrimination
research, we analyse gender representation across four decades of reporting. We
find a consistent overrepresentation of men, but also a gradual shift toward
more balanced coverage in recent years. Using a scalable, structured analysis
pipeline, we provide a foundation for studying actor mentions, sentiment, and
linguistic framing in German journalistic texts.
  The corpus supports a wide range of applications, from diachronic language
analysis to critical media studies, and is freely available to foster inclusive
and reproducible research in German-language NLP.

### [6] [Understanding Gender Bias in AI-Generated Product Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05390)
*Markelle Kelly,Mohammad Tahaei,Padhraic Smyth,Lauren Wilcox*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在电子商务中生成产品描述时的性别偏见，提出了新的分类方法，并分析了GPT-3.5和电商专用LLM中的偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM的性别偏见在许多领域已被广泛研究，但在电子商务中的应用尚未充分探讨，可能揭示新的算法偏见和危害。

Method: 开发了数据驱动的性别偏见分类方法，并定量分析了GPT-3.5和电商专用LLM中的偏见问题。

Result: 研究发现电商场景中存在独特的性别偏见形式，如服装尺寸假设、产品特征刻板印象和说服性语言差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了电子商务中未被充分探索的性别偏见维度，补充了现有AI危害框架中的排斥性规范、刻板印象和性能差异问题。

Abstract: While gender bias in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively
studied in many domains, uses of LLMs in e-commerce remain largely unexamined
and may reveal novel forms of algorithmic bias and harm. Our work investigates
this space, developing data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias in the
context of product description generation, which we situate with respect to
existing general purpose harms taxonomies. We illustrate how AI-generated
product descriptions can uniquely surface gender biases in ways that require
specialized detection and mitigation approaches. Further, we quantitatively
analyze issues corresponding to our taxonomic categories in two models used for
this task -- GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM -- demonstrating that these
forms of bias commonly occur in practice. Our results illuminate unique,
under-explored dimensions of gender bias, such as assumptions about clothing
size, stereotypical bias in which features of a product are advertised, and
differences in the use of persuasive language. These insights contribute to our
understanding of three types of AI harms identified by current frameworks:
exclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities, particularly for
the context of e-commerce.

### [7] [Are Large Language Models Good Temporal Graph Learners?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05393)
*Shenyang Huang,Ali Parviz,Emma Kondrup,Zachary Yang,Zifeng Ding,Michael Bronstein,Reihaneh Rabbany,Guillaume Rabusseau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TGTalker是一种新颖的时序图学习框架，利用LLMs处理动态图数据，在链接预测任务中表现优异，并提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注静态图或合成时序图，而LLMs在真实动态图中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: TGTalker通过时序图的近期偏好提取结构信息，转化为自然语言输入LLMs，并利用时序邻居信息辅助预测。

Result: 在五个真实网络中，TGTalker与前沿时序图方法表现相当，且优于TGN和HTGN，同时生成预测的文本解释。

Conclusion: TGTalker填补了LLMs在动态图应用的空白，为时序链接预测提供了新的可解释性方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently driven significant advancements in
Natural Language Processing and various other applications. While a broad range
of literature has explored the graph-reasoning capabilities of LLMs, including
their use of predictors on graphs, the application of LLMs to dynamic graphs --
real world evolving networks -- remains relatively unexplored. Recent work
studies synthetic temporal graphs generated by random graph models, but
applying LLMs to real-world temporal graphs remains an open question. To
address this gap, we introduce Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker), a novel
temporal graph learning framework designed for LLMs. TGTalker utilizes the
recency bias in temporal graphs to extract relevant structural information,
converted to natural language for LLMs, while leveraging temporal neighbors as
additional information for prediction. TGTalker demonstrates competitive link
prediction capabilities compared to existing Temporal Graph Neural Network
(TGNN) models. Across five real-world networks, TGTalker performs competitively
with state-of-the-art temporal graph methods while consistently outperforming
popular models such as TGN and HTGN. Furthermore, TGTalker generates textual
explanations for each prediction, thus opening up exciting new directions in
explainability and interpretability for temporal link prediction. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/shenyangHuang/TGTalker.

*Ayesha Qamar,Arushi Raghuvanshi,Conal Sathi,Youngseo Son*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Auto Review系统，通过两阶段后处理流程提高医疗电话转录的准确性，减少人工审核负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗电话转录中的噪音和领域术语导致信息提取不准确，影响患者治疗效率，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用多ASR替代方案和伪标签方法，结合大型语言模型和特征模型提升转录质量。

Result: 实验显示转录准确性显著提高，Auto Review效率增强。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了ASR问题，提升了医疗电话转录的自动化水平。

Abstract: Automating benefit verification phone calls saves time in healthcare and
helps patients receive treatment faster. It is critical to obtain highly
accurate information in these phone calls, as it can affect a patient's
healthcare journey. Given the noise in phone call transcripts, we have a
two-stage system that involves a post-call review phase for potentially noisy
fields, where human reviewers manually verify the extracted
data$\unicode{x2013}$a labor-intensive task. To automate this stage, we
introduce Auto Review, which significantly reduces manual effort while
maintaining a high bar for accuracy. This system, being highly reliant on call
transcripts, suffers a performance bottleneck due to automatic speech
recognition (ASR) issues. This problem is further exacerbated by the use of
domain-specific jargon in the calls. In this work, we propose a second-stage
postprocessing pipeline for accurate information extraction. We improve
accuracy by using multiple ASR alternatives and a pseudo-labeling approach that
does not require manually corrected transcripts. Experiments with
general-purpose large language models and feature-based model pipelines
demonstrate substantial improvements in the quality of corrected call
transcripts, thereby enhancing the efficiency of Auto Review.

*Wanyun Cui,Mingwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AsymKV的KV缓存压缩框架，通过利用键和值的不对称性，实现了更高效的长上下文建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）中注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了长上下文建模的效率，而现有压缩方法未区分键和值的特性。

Method: 提出AsymKV框架，结合基于同质性的键合并和数学证明的无损值压缩。

Result: 在LLaMA3.1-8B等模型上，AsymKV在LongBench任务中平均得分43.95，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AsymKV通过区分键和值的特性，显著提升了长上下文建模的效率，为LLM的扩展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the critical
importance of extending context length, yet the quadratic complexity of
attention mechanisms poses significant challenges for efficient long-context
modeling. KV cache compression has emerged as a key approach to address this
challenge. Through extensive empirical analysis, we reveal a fundamental yet
previously overlooked asymmetry in KV caches: while adjacent keys receive
similar attention weights (local homogeneity), adjacent values demonstrate
distinct heterogeneous distributions. This key-value asymmetry reveals a
critical limitation in existing compression methods that treat keys and values
uniformly. To address the limitation, we propose a training-free compression
framework (AsymKV) that combines homogeneity-based key merging with a
mathematically proven lossless value compression. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AsymKV consistently outperforms existing long-context methods
across various tasks and base models. For example, on LLaMA3.1-8B, AsymKV
achieves an average score of 43.95 on LongBench, surpassing SOTA methods like
H$_2$O (38.89) by a large margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在4位量化时面临激活异常值的挑战，影响量化精度。SmoothRot旨在解决这一问题，提升量化效率。

Method: SmoothRot结合通道级缩放和Hadamard变换，将极端异常值转化为适合量化的激活值。

Result: 在LLaMA2 7B、LLaMA3.1 8B和Mistral 7B等模型上的实验表明，SmoothRot将量化与FP16模型的性能差距缩小了10-30%，且不增加推理延迟。

Conclusion: SmoothRot是一种高效的量化技术，显著提升了LLMs的量化性能，适用于语言生成和零样本推理任务。

Abstract: We present SmoothRot, a novel post-training quantization technique to enhance
the efficiency of 4-bit quantization in Large Language Models (LLMs). SmoothRot
addresses the critical challenge of massive activation outliers, by integrating
channel-wise scaling with Hadamard transformations. Our technique effectively
transforms extreme outliers into quantization-friendly activations,
significantly improving quantization accuracy. Experiments conducted on popular
LLMs (LLaMA2 7B, LLaMA3.1 8B, and Mistral 7B) demonstrate that SmoothRot
consistently reduces the performance gap between quantized and FP16 models by
approximately 10-30\% across language generation and zero-shot reasoning tasks,
without introducing additional inference latency. Code is available at

Motivation: 探索如何通过计算方式预测Reddit用户对Wordle游戏的趣味反应，以量化游戏中的幽默创造力。

Method: 从Reddit抓取约80k条用户反应，用GPT-3.5进行少样本分类，验证其与人工标签的一致性，并提取游戏特征预测用户反应。

Result: 研究发现游戏特征能弱预测用户的有趣反应，表明幽默创造力在Wordle游戏中是可测量的。

Conclusion: 用户对Wordle游戏的趣味反应可以部分通过计算预测，揭示了游戏设计中幽默创造力的可量化性。

Abstract: We explore automatically predicting which Wordle games Reddit users find
amusing.
  We scrape approximately 80k reactions by Reddit users to Wordle games from
Reddit, classify the reactions as expressing amusement or not using OpenAI's
GPT-3.5 using few-shot prompting, and verify that GPT-3.5's labels roughly
correspond to human labels.
  We then extract features from Wordle games that can predict user amusement.
We demonstrate that the features indeed provide a (weak) signal that predicts
user amusement as predicted by GPT-3.5.
  Our results indicate that user amusement at Wordle games can be predicted
computationally to some extent. We explore which features of the game
contribute to user amusement.
  We find that user amusement is predictable, indicating a measurable aspect of
creativity infused into Wordle games through humor.

*Hongbo Zhao,Fei Zhu,Rundong Wang,Gaofeng Meng,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLM-CL是一个新的多模态大语言模型持续学习基准，通过参数隔离和路由机制解决动态场景下的知识整合问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在动态现实场景中难以持续整合新知识和技能，现有持续学习方法和基准存在局限。

Method: 提出参数隔离和基于MLLM的路由机制，防止灾难性干扰。

Result: 实验表明该方法能最小化遗忘，有效整合领域知识和功能能力，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MLLM-CL为动态场景下的持续学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language
understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios
that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While
continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and
methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL,
a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the
former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation
across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID
scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing
catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based
routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can
integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal
forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.

### [13] [Multidimensional Analysis of Specific Language Impairment Using Unsupervised Learning Through PCA and Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05498)
*Niruthiha Selvanayagam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究利用无监督机器学习方法分析了特定语言障碍（SLI）儿童的自然语言发展轨迹，发现SLI主要表现为语言产出能力下降而非句法复杂性缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统诊断方法可能忽略细微发展模式，研究旨在通过无监督学习技术为早期识别和干预提供新视角。

Method: 分析了1,163名4-16岁儿童的叙事样本，使用PCA和聚类技术评估64个语言特征。

Result: 发现两个主要集群：高语言产出低SLI和低产出高句法复杂性高SLI，支持语言能力的连续模型。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了分类诊断框架，展示了无监督学习在优化诊断和干预策略中的潜力。

Abstract: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) affects approximately 7 percent of
children, presenting as isolated language deficits despite normal cognitive
abilities, sensory systems, and supportive environments. Traditional diagnostic
approaches often rely on standardized assessments, which may overlook subtle
developmental patterns. This study aims to identify natural language
development trajectories in children with and without SLI using unsupervised
machine learning techniques, providing insights for early identification and
targeted interventions. Narrative samples from 1,163 children aged 4-16 years
across three corpora (Conti-Ramsden 4, ENNI, and Gillam) were analyzed using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. A total of 64 linguistic
features were evaluated to uncover developmental trajectories and distinguish
linguistic profiles. Two primary clusters emerged: (1) high language production
with low SLI prevalence, and (2) limited production but higher syntactic
complexity with higher SLI prevalence. Additionally, boundary cases exhibited
intermediate traits, supporting a continuum model of language abilities.
Findings suggest SLI manifests primarily through reduced production capacity
rather than syntactic complexity deficits. The results challenge categorical
diagnostic frameworks and highlight the potential of unsupervised learning
techniques for refining diagnostic criteria and intervention strategies.

*Petr Máša*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于增强关联规则的新方法，通过规则到文本的转换，将规则集作为RAG输入到LLM中，显著提升了基于数据集的问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在问答任务中面临安全和可控性问题，希望通过可解释的ML方法（如增强关联规则）改进基于数据集的回答，并与RAG等安全技术结合。

Method: 提出一种方法：基于知识模式生成规则集，通过规则到文本转换器将规则转为文本，并将其作为RAG输入到LLM中。

Result: 与ChatGPT（包括使用代理）相比，该方法在基于数据集的问答任务中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法具有潜力，未来可通过引入更多模式、将规则挖掘作为代理等方式进一步优化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are achieving significant progress almost every
moment now. Many advanced techniques have been introduced and widely accepted,
like retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG), agents, and tools. Tools can
query the database to answer questions from structured data files or perform
groupings or other statistics. This unlocks huge opportunities, such as it can
answer any question, but also poses threats, such as safety, because there is
no control over the commands that are created. We would like to discuss whether
we can create a new method that improves answers based on dataset/database via
some interpretable ML methods, namely enhanced association rules. The advantage
would be if the method can be also used in some safe technique like RAG.
Association rules have a sound history. Since the introduction of CN2 and
aproiri, many enhancements have been made. In parallel, enhanced association
rules have been introduced and evolved over the last 40 years. The general
problem is typically that there are too many rules. There are some techniques
for handling it, but when LLM emerged, it turned out to be the best use case
for the RAG technique for LLMs. We proposed a method that generates a ruleset
based on defined knowledge patterns, then converts rules into text form via a
rule-to-text converter, and includes the result as an RAG into LLM. We compared
this method with ChatGPT (even with using agents) and we have discovered a
significant improvement in answering questions based on the dataset. We have
also tried several strategies how much rules to generate. We found this
improvement interesting. Moreover, it can also be improved in many ways as
future work, like incorporating other patterns, the use of rule mining as an
agent, and many others.

TL;DR: 论文描述了一个基于大语言模型的系统，用于从电子健康记录中回答临床问题，通过两步法优化句子选择和回答生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从电子健康记录中高效准确地回答临床问题的挑战。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 使用大语言模型筛选相关句子；2) 生成简短且有引用的回答。优化方法包括少样本提示、自一致性和阈值处理。

Result: 较小的8B模型在筛选相关信息时表现优于较大的70B模型，且准确的句子选择对生成高质量回答至关重要。

Conclusion: 自一致性与阈值处理能提升句子选择的可靠性，从而改善回答质量。

Abstract: We describe our system for the ArchEHR-QA Shared Task on answering clinical
questions using electronic health records (EHRs). Our approach uses large
language models in two steps: first, to find sentences in the EHR relevant to a
clinician's question, and second, to generate a short, citation-supported
response based on those sentences. We use few-shot prompting, self-consistency,
and thresholding to improve the sentence classification step to decide which
sentences are essential. We compare several models and find that a smaller 8B
model performs better than a larger 70B model for identifying relevant
information. Our results show that accurate sentence selection is critical for
generating high-quality responses and that self-consistency with thresholding
helps make these decisions more reliable.

TL;DR: SynthesizeMe通过用户交互生成合成用户角色，用于个性化奖励建模，提升LLM的个性化判断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖额外身份信息，而SynthesizeMe旨在通过用户交互生成合成角色，减少对预定义信息的依赖。

Method: 生成并验证解释用户偏好的推理，从中诱导合成用户角色，并筛选信息丰富的交互数据以构建个性化提示。

Result: 在Chatbot Arena上，个性化判断准确性提升4.4%；在PersonalRewardBench上表现最佳。

Conclusion: SynthesizeMe为个性化奖励建模提供了一种高效方法，减少了对预定义信息的依赖。

Abstract: Recent calls for pluralistic alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs)
encourage adapting models to diverse user preferences. However, most prior work
on personalized reward models heavily rely on additional identity information,
such as demographic details or a predefined set of preference categories. To
this end, we introduce SynthesizeMe, an approach to inducing synthetic user
personas from user interactions for personalized reward modeling. SynthesizeMe
first generates and verifies reasoning to explain user preferences, then
induces synthetic user personas from that reasoning, and finally filters to
informative prior user interactions in order to build personalized prompts for
a particular user. We show that using SynthesizeMe induced prompts improves
personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% on Chatbot Arena. Combining
SynthesizeMe derived prompts with a reward model achieves top performance on
PersonalRewardBench: a new curation of user-stratified interactions with
chatbots collected from 854 users of Chatbot Arena and PRISM.

Motivation: 评估LLMs模拟真实用户行为的能力，因缺乏高质量公开数据集而受限。

Method: 通过在线问卷和浏览器插件收集OPERA数据集，包含用户人设、观察、细粒度行为和即时理性。

Result: 建立了首个LLM预测用户行为和理性的基准。

Conclusion: OPERA为未来研究个性化LLM代理（数字孪生）奠定了基础。

Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a
specific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating
``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user
behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality,
publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the
internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce
OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected
from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the
first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser
observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time
rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser
plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the
first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's
next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action,
rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into
LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索预训练语言模型在阿尔茨海默病筛查中对性别因素的敏感性，并解决性别混淆问题。

Method: 提出了两种方法：Extended Confounding Filter和Dual Filter，用于隔离和消除与性别相关的权重。

Result: 结果显示，Transformer模型容易过拟合训练数据分布，去混淆方法虽略微降低检测性能，但能有效减少性别影响。

Conclusion: 结论是去混淆方法能有效减少性别对痴呆检测的影响，但需权衡检测性能的轻微下降。

Abstract: Deep transformer models have been used to detect linguistic anomalies in
patient transcripts for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) screening. While
pre-trained neural language models (LMs) fine-tuned on AD transcripts perform
well, little research has explored the effects of the gender of the speakers
represented by these transcripts. This work addresses gender confounding in
dementia detection and proposes two methods: the $\textit{Extended Confounding
Filter}$ and the $\textit{Dual Filter}$, which isolate and ablate weights
associated with gender. We evaluate these methods on dementia datasets with
first-person narratives from patients with cognitive impairment and healthy
controls. Our results show transformer models tend to overfit to training data
distributions. Disrupting gender-related weights results in a deconfounded
dementia classifier, with the trade-off of slightly reduced dementia detection
performance.

Conclusion: ID-SPAM是一种简单高效的参数微调方法，适用于大语言模型的领域适应任务。

Abstract: The performance of large language models in domain-specific tasks
necessitates fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and technically
challenging. This paper focuses on parameter-efficient fine-tuning using soft
prompting, a promising approach that adapts pre-trained models to downstream
tasks by learning a small set of parameters. We propose a novel Input Dependent
Soft Prompting technique with a self-Attention Mechanism (ID-SPAM) that
generates soft prompts based on the input tokens and attends different tokens
with varying importance. Our method is simple and efficient, keeping the number
of trainable parameters small. We show the merits of the proposed approach
compared to state-of-the-art techniques on various tasks and show the improved
zero shot domain transfer capability.

Abstract: Extremist groups develop complex in-group language, also referred to as
cryptolects, to exclude or mislead outsiders. We investigate the ability of
current language technologies to detect and interpret the cryptolects of two
online extremist platforms. Evaluating eight models across six tasks, our
results indicate that general purpose LLMs cannot consistently detect or decode

domain adaptation and specialised prompting techniques. These results provide
important insights to inform the development and deployment of automated
moderation technologies. We further develop and release novel labelled and
unlabelled datasets, including 19.4M posts from extremist platforms and
lexicons validated by human experts.

Conclusion: 合成数据为研究语言模型记忆机制提供了新工具，但构建高质量虚构数据仍需进一步探索。

Abstract: When language models are trained on textual data, they acquire both knowledge
about the structure of language as well as knowledge of facts about the world.
At inference time, their knowledge of facts can be leveraged to solve
interesting problems and perform useful knowledge work for users. It is well
known that language models can verbatim memorize long sequences from their
training data. However, it is much less well understood how language models
memorize facts seen during training. In this work, we propose a new dataset to
specifically empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact
memorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of
synthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events, as well
as question-answer pairs about the events. We conduct training experiments
showing how synthetic data about fictional events can be effective in teasing
apart different forms of memorization. We also document the challenges in
effectively building realistic, fictional synthetic data.

TL;DR: CulturalPersonas是一个大规模基准测试，用于评估LLMs在文化背景下的个性表达，覆盖六个国家的3000个场景问题，显著提升了LLMs与文化特定人类个性分布的匹配度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在互动应用中的普及，个性表达与文化适应性的结合变得至关重要，而现有研究忽视了文化与个性的相互作用。

Method: 提出CulturalPersonas基准测试，包含3000个基于场景的问题，评估三种LLMs的多选和开放式回答。

Result: CulturalPersonas显著减少了Wasserstein距离（20%以上），并生成更具表达力和文化一致性的输出。

Conclusion: CulturalPersonas为LLMs的全球行为规范对齐提供了新方向，推动了更具社会智能和全球适应性的LLMs发展。

Abstract: As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to
mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate
ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality
evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and
personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first
large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality
expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset
spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to
elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We
evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response
formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with
country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in
Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive,
culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas
surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded
prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior.
By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that
CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally
adaptive LLMs.

TL;DR: MEFA是一个基于多源证据模糊聚合的零样本框架，用于解决事件因果关系识别（ECI）中的因果幻觉问题，通过任务分解和模糊聚合显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ECI模型依赖大规模标注数据，而大型语言模型（LLMs）在零样本ECI中容易产生因果幻觉，MEFA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MEFA将因果关系推理分解为三个主任务和三个辅助任务，通过精心设计的提示引导LLMs生成不确定性和确定性输出，并通过模糊聚合整合证据进行评分和判定。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，MEFA的F1分数和精确度分别比次优无监督基线高出6.2%和9.3%，同时显著减少幻觉导致的错误。

Conclusion: MEFA通过任务分解和模糊聚合有效提升了ECI性能，验证了其方法的优越性。

Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) aims to detect causal relationships
between events in textual contexts. Existing ECI models predominantly rely on
supervised methodologies, suffering from dependence on large-scale annotated
data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) enable zero-shot ECI, they are
prone to causal hallucination-erroneously establishing spurious causal links.
To address these challenges, we propose MEFA, a novel zero-shot framework based
on Multi-source Evidence Fuzzy Aggregation. First, we decompose causality
reasoning into three main tasks (temporality determination, necessity analysis,
and sufficiency verification) complemented by three auxiliary tasks. Second,
leveraging meticulously designed prompts, we guide LLMs to generate uncertain
responses and deterministic outputs. Finally, we quantify LLM's responses of
sub-tasks and employ fuzzy aggregation to integrate these evidence for
causality scoring and causality determination. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks demonstrate that MEFA outperforms second-best unsupervised baselines
by 6.2% in F1-score and 9.3% in precision, while significantly reducing
hallucination-induced errors. In-depth analysis verify the effectiveness of
task decomposition and the superiority of fuzzy aggregation.

Motivation: 研究动机在于整合PSG、DG和CG的表示原则，以提供一种统一的语法分析方法，特别是在处理不连续句法结构时。

Method: 论文通过提出对应原则，并以土耳其语中的不连续从句为例，展示了如何实现统一表示。

Result: 结果表明，统一表示方法能够简化计算复杂性，并对连续和不连续句子的神经认知表示与处理产生重要影响。

Conclusion: 结论指出，这种统一表示方法为自然语言的不连续性提供了新的理论视角，并整合了PSG、DG和CG的基本原则，对句法分析具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper advances a unified representation of linguistic structure for
three grammar formalisms, namely, Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), Dependency
Grammar (DG) and Categorial Grammar (CG) from the perspective of syntactic and
computational complexity considerations. The correspondence principle is
proposed to enable a unified representation of the representational principles
from PSG, DG, and CG. To that end, the paper first illustrates a series of
steps in achieving a unified representation for a discontinuous subordinate
clause from Turkish as an illustrative case. This affords a new way of
approaching discontinuity in natural language from a theoretical point of view
that unites and integrates the basic tenets of PSG, DG, and CG, with
significant consequences for syntactic analysis. Then this paper demonstrates
that a unified representation can simplify computational complexity with
regards to the neurocognitive representation and processing of both continuous
and discontinuous sentences vis-\`a-vis the basic principles of PSG, DG, and
CG.

Result: 通过基准测试，系统分析了GraphRAG的优势场景及其成功原因。

Conclusion: GraphRAG在特定场景下优于传统RAG，研究结果为实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. It
leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts,
enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate
reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG
frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a
critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do
graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this,
we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual
reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of
increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual
summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the
entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final
generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the
conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons
for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application. All related
resources and analyses are collected for the community at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KD方法在训练过程中可能导致学生模型分布显著偏移，引发灾难性遗忘、模式崩溃等问题。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了POCL框架。

Method: POCL包含两个核心组件：难度测量器（对样本从易到难排序和分区）和训练调度器（逐步引入样本并应用温度递增的损失函数）。

Result: 实验表明，POCL能显著提升蒸馏学生模型的性能，适用于多种白盒KD方法和模型家族。

Conclusion: POCL通过结构化训练数据，有效提升了KD过程的稳定性和性能，为LLM的压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLM）在多个领域表现出色，但其在关系深度学习（RDL）中的应用仍未被充分探索。现有方法将结构化数据转换为扁平文本，忽略了关键关系结构并导致冗余。

Method: Rel-LLM利用GNN编码器提取实体周围的局部子图，构建包含实体关系和时序依赖的特征表示，并通过反规范化过程将其转换为结构化提示，使LLM能够处理复杂关系。

Result: 实验表明，Rel-LLM在关键RDL任务上优于现有方法，提供了一种可扩展且高效的方式将LLM与结构化数据源集成。

Conclusion: Rel-LLM通过保留数据库的固有关系结构，为LLM处理复杂关系提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet their application to relational deep learning (RDL)
remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational
links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into
flat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical
relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM
context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a
graph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational
prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.
Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves
the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to
effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically,
the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature
representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal
dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts
using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over
relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and
efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources. Code is
available at https://github.com/smiles724/Rel-LLM.

Method: 提出知识遗忘评估框架，利用知识图表示事实上下文，并设计基于推理的评估协议，使用LLM评委判断遗忘效果。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能更真实、严格地评估遗忘性能，并揭示现有评估策略高估了遗忘效果。

Conclusion: 该框架为知识遗忘提供了更准确的评估方法，并指出了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in
large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus
on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential
dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs.
Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through
correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge
unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit
structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as
knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an
inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these
judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning
success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated
against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability.
Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our
framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning
performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies
tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available

Abstract: Temporal tabular question answering presents a significant challenge for
Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring robust reasoning over structured data,
which is a task where traditional prompting methods often fall short. These
methods face challenges such as memorization, sensitivity to table size, and
reduced performance on complex queries. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce TempTabQA-C, a synthetic dataset designed for systematic and
controlled evaluations, alongside a symbolic intermediate representation that
transforms tables into database schemas. This structured approach allows LLMs
to generate and execute SQL queries, enhancing generalization and mitigating
biases. By incorporating adaptive few-shot prompting with contextually tailored
examples, our method achieves superior robustness, scalability, and
performance. Experimental results consistently highlight improvements across
key challenges, setting a new benchmark for robust temporal reasoning with

Result: 实验表明，该框架在7B规模模型上显著提升了长文本写作性能，并展现出对长输入推理任务的良好泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled strong
performance in long-form writing, yet existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
approaches suffer from limitations such as data saturation and restricted
learning capacity bounded by teacher signals. In this work, we present
Writing-RL: an Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework to advance
long-form writing capabilities beyond SFT. The framework consists of three key
components: Margin-aware Data Selection strategy that prioritizes samples with
high learning potential, Pairwise Comparison Reward mechanism that provides
discriminative learning signals in the absence of verifiable rewards, and
Dynamic Reference Scheduling approach, which plays a particularly critical role
by adaptively adjusting task difficulty based on evolving model performance.
Experiments on 7B-scale writer models show that our RL framework largely
improves long-form writing performance over strong SFT baselines. Furthermore,
we observe that models trained with long-output RL generalize surprisingly well
to long-input reasoning tasks, potentially offering a promising perspective for
rethinking long-context training.

*Saptarshi Sengupta,Shuhua Yang,Paul Kwong Yu,Fali Wang,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BioMol-MQA是一个多模态问答数据集，旨在测试LLMs在检索和推理多模态知识图谱（包括文本和分子结构）方面的能力。现有LLMs在此任务上表现不佳，凸显了强大RAG框架的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG-based LLMs主要针对单模态（文本）信息检索，而现实问题（如医疗）需要多模态信息（如知识图谱、临床笔记、分子结构）的检索与推理。

Method: 提出BioMol-MQA数据集，包含多模态知识图谱（文本和分子结构）和设计用于测试LLMs能力的挑战性问题。

Result: 现有LLMs在未提供背景数据时表现不佳，表明需要更强的RAG框架。

Conclusion: BioMol-MQA为多模态RAG研究提供了基准，强调了开发支持多模态检索和推理的LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has shown great power in improving Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing RAG-based LLMs are dedicated to
retrieving single modality information, mainly text; while for many real-world
problems, such as healthcare, information relevant to queries can manifest in
various modalities such as knowledge graph, text (clinical notes), and complex
molecular structure. Thus, being able to retrieve relevant multi-modality
domain-specific information, and reason and synthesize diverse knowledge to
generate an accurate response is important. To address the gap, we present
BioMol-MQA, a new question-answering (QA) dataset on polypharmacy, which is
composed of two parts (i) a multimodal knowledge graph (KG) with text and
molecular structure for information retrieval; and (ii) challenging questions
that designed to test LLM capabilities in retrieving and reasoning over
multimodal KG to answer questions. Our benchmarks indicate that existing LLMs
struggle to answer these questions and do well only when given the necessary
background data, signaling the necessity for strong RAG frameworks.

Conclusion: 开源中间训练检查点，促进大语言模型研究。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for
scaling language models efficiently by activating only a subset of parameters
for each input token. In this report, we present dots.llm1, a large-scale MoE
model that activates 14B parameters out of a total of 142B parameters,
delivering performance on par with state-of-the-art models while reducing
training and inference costs. Leveraging our meticulously crafted and efficient
data processing pipeline, dots.llm1 achieves performance comparable to
Qwen2.5-72B after pretraining on 11.2T high-quality tokens and post-training to
fully unlock its capabilities. Notably, no synthetic data is used during
pretraining. To foster further research, we open-source intermediate training
checkpoints at every one trillion tokens, providing valuable insights into the
learning dynamics of large language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）具备感知时间流逝的能力，并能根据时间调整决策行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否能够感知时间流逝并据此调整行为，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过三个实验验证：1）Token-Time假设验证；2）用户紧急情况下LLMs的响应调整；3）动态环境中的时间压力测试（BombRush任务）。

Result: LLMs能够将离散的token映射到连续时间，并在时间压力下调整行为，但能力因模型规模和推理能力而异。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs在时间敏感应用中的时间感知能力提供了理论基础。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at temporal reasoning tasks like
event ordering and duration estimation, their ability to perceive the actual
passage of time remains unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs perceive the
passage of time and adapt their decision-making accordingly through three
complementary experiments. First, we introduce the Token-Time Hypothesis,
positing that LLMs can map discrete token counts to continuous wall-clock time,
and validate this through a dialogue duration judgment task. Second, we
demonstrate that LLMs could use this awareness to adapt their response length
while maintaining accuracy when users express urgency in question answering
tasks. Finally, we develop BombRush, an interactive navigation challenge that
examines how LLMs modify behavior under progressive time pressure in dynamic
environments. Our findings indicate that LLMs possess certain awareness of time
passage, enabling them to bridge discrete linguistic tokens and continuous
physical time, though this capability varies with model size and reasoning
abilities. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for enhancing
temporal awareness in LLMs for time-sensitive applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏错误检测和经验复用机制，无法模拟人类问题解决过程。

Method: 提出MAPLE框架，包含Solver、Checker、Reflector和Archiver四个组件，实现反馈驱动的多智能体协作。

Result: 在WiKiTQ和TabFact数据集上取得显著提升，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MAPLE通过模拟人类问题解决过程，显著提升了表格问答的推理能力。

Abstract: Table-based question answering requires complex reasoning capabilities that
current LLMs struggle to achieve with single-pass inference. Existing
approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought reasoning and question decomposition, lack
error detection mechanisms and discard problem-solving experiences, contrasting
sharply with how humans tackle such problems. In this paper, we propose MAPLE
(Multi-agent Adaptive Planning with Long-term mEmory), a novel framework that
mimics human problem-solving through specialized cognitive agents working in a
feedback-driven loop. MAPLE integrates 4 key components: (1) a Solver using the
ReAct paradigm for reasoning, (2) a Checker for answer verification, (3) a
Reflector for error diagnosis and strategy correction, and (4) an Archiver
managing long-term memory for experience reuse and evolution. Experiments on
WiKiTQ and TabFact demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple LLM backbones.

TL;DR: FinanceReasoning是一个新的基准测试，用于评估大型推理模型（LRMs）在金融数值推理问题中的能力，具有可信性、全面性和挑战性三大特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在金融领域的覆盖范围和评估标准不足，无法准确评估LRMs的推理能力改进。

Method: 通过更新和标注问题、构建Python格式化函数，并设计高难度问题，评估和提升LRMs的金融推理能力。

Result: FinanceReasoning显著提升了模型表现（如GPT-4o从83.2%提升到91.6%），但LRMs在数值精度上仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 结合推理器和编程器模型能有效提升LRMs性能，为领域特定复杂推理任务的研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce FinanceReasoning, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) in financial numerical
reasoning problems. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key advancements. (1) Credibility: We update 15.6% of the questions from four
public datasets, annotating 908 new questions with detailed Python solutions
and rigorously refining evaluation standards. This enables an accurate
assessment of the reasoning improvements of LRMs. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinanceReasoning covers 67.8% of financial concepts and formulas, significantly
surpassing existing datasets. Additionally, we construct 3,133 Python-formatted
functions, which enhances LRMs' financial reasoning capabilities through
refined knowledge (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 91.6% for GPT-4o). (3) Challenge:
Models are required to apply multiple financial formulas for precise numerical
reasoning on 238 Hard problems. The best-performing model (i.e., OpenAI o1 with
PoT) achieves 89.1% accuracy, yet LRMs still face challenges in numerical
precision. We demonstrate that combining Reasoner and Programmer models can
effectively enhance LRMs' performance (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 87.8% for
DeepSeek-R1). Our work paves the way for future research on evaluating and
improving LRMs in domain-specific complex reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现多语言大模型在推理时会倾向于使用其预训练主导语言，即使提示为其他语言，这种现象称为“跨语言崩溃”。通过实验发现，训练中的语言不平衡会迅速放大，且语言一致性奖励会以牺牲准确性为代价缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多语言大模型（LRMs）在多语言推理中的机制，尤其是其推理链为何会倾向于预训练主导语言。

Method: 使用Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)在中文、韩语和乌克兰语的翻译数据集上微调多语言LRMs，监控任务准确性和语言一致性。

Result: GRPO会迅速放大预训练语言不平衡，语言一致性奖励可缓解但会降低准确性，且语言崩溃现象难以逆转。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多语言推理中语言不平等的问题，并强调了奖励塑造、数据难度和预训练先验的作用。

Abstract: We identify \textbf{Cross-lingual Collapse}, a systematic drift in which the
chain-of-thought (CoT) of a multilingual language model reverts to its dominant
pre-training language even when the prompt is expressed in a different
language. Recent large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by
exposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning
models (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is
not yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual
LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of
the GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese,
Korean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and
language consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key
findings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading
to the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates;
(ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the
expense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting
language collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent
fine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original
target-language reasoning capabilities. Together, these findings point to a
remarkable conclusion: \textit{not all languages are trained equally for
reasoning}. Furthermore, our paper sheds light on the roles of reward shaping,
data difficulty, and pre-training priors in eliciting multilingual reasoning.

TL;DR: R2-Reasoner是一个新颖的框架，通过动态路由子任务到不同规模的模型，实现高效且准确的协作推理，显著降低API成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步推理能提升大语言模型（LLMs）的问题解决能力，但长推理链会增加计算成本。许多子任务可由小型语言模型（SLMs）高效处理，因此需要一种动态分配任务的机制。

Method: 提出R2-Reasoner框架，包含任务分解器和子任务分配器，通过强化学习训练动态路由子任务到不同规模的模型。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，R2-Reasoner将API成本降低86.85%，同时保持或超越基线准确性。

Conclusion: R2-Reasoner为高效且自适应的LLM推理提供了新方向，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning has proven essential for enhancing the problem-solving
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into
intermediate steps, either explicitly or implicitly. Extending the reasoning
chain at test time through deeper thought processes or broader exploration, can
furthur improve performance, but often incurs substantial costs due to the
explosion in token usage. Yet, many reasoning steps are relatively simple and
can be handled by more efficient smaller-scale language models (SLMs). This
motivates hybrid approaches that allocate subtasks across models of varying
capacities. However, realizing such collaboration requires accurate task
decomposition and difficulty-aware subtask allocation, which is challenging. To
address this, we propose R2-Reasoner, a novel framework that enables
collaborative reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs by dynamically routing
sub-tasks based on estimated complexity. At the core of our framework is a
Reinforced Model Router, composed of a task decomposer and a subtask allocator.
The task decomposer segments complex input queries into logically ordered
subtasks, while the subtask allocator assigns each subtask to the most
appropriate model, ranging from lightweight SLMs to powerful LLMs, balancing
accuracy and efficiency. To train this router, we introduce a staged pipeline
that combines supervised fine-tuning on task-specific datasets with Group
Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, enabling self-supervised refinement
through iterative reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across four
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that R2-Reasoner reduces API costs by 86.85%
while maintaining or surpassing baseline accuracy. Our framework paves the way
for more cost-effective and adaptive LLM reasoning. The code is open-source at

Motivation: 虚假信息对社会构成重大威胁，手动核实成本高且不可扩展，LLM在自动化反驳中有潜力但存在幻觉问题。

Method: 提出MisMitiFact框架，利用轻量级反馈模型对LLM输出进行细化，确保回应基于事实。

Result: 实验表明，MisMitiFact生成的反驳质量与LLM自反馈相当，但吞吐量提高约5倍。

Conclusion: MisMitiFact适合大规模、经济高效的虚假信息缓解，代码和模板已开源。

Abstract: Fake news and misinformation poses a significant threat to society, making
efficient mitigation essential. However, manual fact-checking is costly and
lacks scalability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in automating
counter-response generation to mitigate misinformation, but a critical
challenge lies in their tendency to hallucinate non-factual information.
Existing models mainly rely on LLM self-feedback to reduce hallucination, but
this approach is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose
MisMitiFact, Misinformation Mitigation grounded in Facts, an efficient
framework for generating fact-grounded counter-responses at scale. MisMitiFact
generates simple critique feedback to refine LLM outputs, ensuring responses
are grounded in evidence. We develop lightweight, fine-grained critique models
trained on data sourced from readily available fact-checking sites to identify
and correct errors in key elements such as numerals, entities, and topics in
LLM generations. Experiments show that MisMitiFact generates counter-responses
of comparable quality to LLMs' self-feedback while using significantly smaller
critique models. Importantly, it achieves ~5x increase in feedback generation
throughput, making it highly suitable for cost-effective, large-scale
misinformation mitigation. Code and LLM prompt templates are at

Motivation: 现有同质MoE-LoRA方法存在表示崩溃和专家负载不平衡问题，限制了LLM的潜力。

Method: 提出异构MoA方法，包括Soft MoA（加权融合所有专家输出）和Sparse MoA（稀疏激活贡献显著的专家）。

Result: 实验表明，异构MoA在性能和参数效率上均优于同质MoE-LoRA方法。

Conclusion: 异构MoA通过专家多样化提升了预训练知识在下游任务中的迁移效果。

Abstract: Recent studies integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) to further enhance the performance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Existing methods
employ \emph{homogeneous} MoE-LoRA architectures composed of LoRA experts with
either similar or identical structures and capacities. However, these
approaches often suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance,
which negatively impact the potential of LLMs. To address these challenges, we
propose a \emph{heterogeneous} \textbf{Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA)} approach.
This method dynamically integrates PEFT adapter experts with diverse
structures, leveraging their complementary representational capabilities to
foster expert specialization, thereby enhancing the effective transfer of
pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks. MoA supports two variants:
\textbf{(i)} \textit{Soft MoA} achieves fine-grained integration by performing
a weighted fusion of all expert outputs; \textbf{(ii)} \textit{Sparse MoA}
activates adapter experts sparsely based on their contribution, achieving this
with negligible performance degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that
heterogeneous MoA outperforms homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods in both performance
and parameter efficiency. Our project is available at

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) often struggle to dynamically adapt their
reasoning depth to varying task complexities, leading to suboptimal performance
or inefficient resource utilization. To address this, we introduce DynamicMind,
a novel tri-mode thinking system. DynamicMind empowers LLMs to autonomously
select between Fast, Normal, and Slow thinking modes for zero-shot question
answering (ZSQA) tasks through cognitive-inspired prompt engineering. Our
framework's core innovations include: (1) expanding the established
dual-process framework of fast and slow thinking into a tri-mode thinking
system involving a normal thinking mode to preserve the intrinsic capabilities
of LLM; (2) proposing the Thinking Density metric, which aligns computational
resource allocation with problem complexity; and (3) developing the Thinking
Mode Capacity (TMC) dataset and a lightweight Mind Router to predict the
optimal thinking mode. Extensive experiments across diverse mathematical,
commonsense, and scientific QA benchmarks demonstrate that DynamicMind achieves
superior ZSQA capabilities while establishing an effective trade-off between

Result: 开发了综合评估方案验证框架有效性，实验证明其能生成更有效的情感支持回应。

Conclusion: IntentionESC和ICECoT显著提升了情感支持对话的效果，为LLMs在情感支持领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: In emotional support conversations, unclear intentions can lead supporters to
employ inappropriate strategies, inadvertently imposing their expectations or
solutions on the seeker. Clearly defined intentions are essential for guiding
both the supporter's motivations and the overall emotional support process. In
this paper, we propose the Intention-centered Emotional Support Conversation
(IntentionESC) framework, which defines the possible intentions of supporters
in emotional support conversations, identifies key emotional state aspects for
inferring these intentions, and maps them to appropriate support strategies.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generating, they fundamentally
operate as probabilistic models trained on extensive datasets, lacking a true
understanding of human thought processes and intentions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Intention Centric Chain-of-Thought (ICECoT)
mechanism. ICECoT enables LLMs to mimic human reasoning by analyzing emotional
states, inferring intentions, and selecting suitable support strategies,
thereby generating more effective emotional support responses. To train the
model with ICECoT and integrate expert knowledge, we design an automated
annotation pipeline that produces high-quality training data. Furthermore, we
develop a comprehensive evaluation scheme to assess emotional support efficacy
and conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework. Our data and code

Method: 基于大型语言模型（LLM），结合多种提示策略、多样性增强技术和人类反馈优化，生成数学应用题。

Result: 生成的应用题质量高，拼写和语法问题少，但在满足年级和题目类型要求方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLM在MWP生成中具有潜力，但在特定要求的适应性上仍需改进。

Abstract: Mathematics is often perceived as a complex subject by students, leading to
high failure rates in exams. To improve Mathematics skills, it is important to
provide sample questions for students to practice problem-solving. Manually
creating Math Word Problems (MWPs) is time consuming for tutors, because they
have to type in natural language while adhering to grammar and spelling rules
of the language. Existing Deep Learning techniques for MWP generation either
require a tutor to provide the initial portion of the MWP, and/or additional
information such as an equation. In this paper, we present an MWP generation
system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that overcome the need for
additional input - the only input to our system is the number of MWPs needed,
the grade and the type of question (e.g. addition, subtraction). Unlike the
existing LLM-based solutions for MWP generation, we carried out an extensive
set of experiments involving different LLMs, prompting strategies, techniques
to improve the diversity of questions, as well as techniques that employ human
feedback to improve LLM performance. Human and automated evaluations confirmed
that the generated MWPs are high in quality, with minimal spelling and grammar
issues. However, LLMs still struggle to generate questions that adhere to the
specified grade and question type requirements.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的推理时方法Shoes-of-Others (SoO)前缀，用于提升大型语言模型(LLMs)的心理理论(ToM)能力，适用于更广泛的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时方法仅适用于世界状态变化的场景，限制了ToM能力的提升。

Method: 使用SoO前缀（如“Let's put ourselves in A's shoes”）作为LLM输出的开头。

Result: 在两种基准测试中，SoO前缀显著提升了LLMs在五种心理状态类别中的ToM表现。

Conclusion: SoO前缀通过激发真实思考，有效提升了LLMs的ToM能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Theory of Mind (ToM) in large language models
(LLMs) has not reached human-level performance yet. Since fine-tuning LLMs on
ToM datasets often degrades their generalization, several inference-time
methods have been proposed to enhance ToM in LLMs. However, existing
inference-time methods for ToM are specialized for inferring beliefs from
contexts involving changes in the world state. In this study, we present a new
inference-time method for ToM, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, which makes
fewer assumptions about contexts and is applicable to broader scenarios. SoO
prefixing simply specifies the beginning of LLM outputs with ``Let's put
ourselves in A's shoes.'', where A denotes the target character's name. We
evaluate SoO prefixing on two benchmarks that assess ToM in conversational and
narrative contexts without changes in the world state and find that it
consistently improves ToM across five categories of mental states. Our analysis
suggests that SoO prefixing elicits faithful thoughts, thereby improving the
ToM performance.

Conclusion: 简单的实体导向启发式方法可以有效解决上下文窗口受限的问题，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Our contribution to the SemEval 2025 shared task 10, subtask 1 on entity

that a simple entity-oriented heuristics for context selection can enable text

Motivation: 文本匿名化需要在隐私保护和信息保留之间找到平衡，但目前缺乏统一的评估基准。

Conclusion: Tau-Eval填补了文本匿名化评估领域的空白，支持更全面的方法比较。

Abstract: Text anonymization is the process of removing or obfuscating information from
textual data to protect the privacy of individuals. This process inherently
involves a complex trade-off between privacy protection and information
preservation, where stringent anonymization methods can significantly impact
the text's utility for downstream applications. Evaluating the effectiveness of
text anonymization proves challenging from both privacy and utility
perspectives, as there is no universal benchmark that can comprehensively
assess anonymization techniques across diverse, and sometimes contradictory
contexts. We present Tau-Eval, an open-source framework for benchmarking text
anonymization methods through the lens of privacy and utility task sensitivity.
A Python library, code, documentation and tutorials are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在不同语言和文化背景下的性能差异，为构建更具文化敏感性的多语言NLP系统提供依据。

Method: 结合OCR、自动化文本提取和人工验证，构建包含问题领域、文化相关性和难度的数据集，并测试LLMs性能。

Result: LLMs在国际问题上的准确率（80-95%）显著高于罗马尼亚文化相关问题（50-75%）。

Conclusion: 文化背景和数据来源显著影响LLMs性能，研究为教育领域多语言NLP系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate varying performance across languages
and cultural contexts. This study introduces a novel, culturally-rich,
multilingual dataset derived from video recordings of the Romanian game show
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" (Vrei s\u{a} fii Milionar?). We employed an
innovative process combining optical character recognition (OCR), automated
text extraction, and manual verification to collect question-answer pairs,
enriching them with metadata including question domain (e.g., biology,
history), cultural relevance (Romanian-specific vs. international), and
difficulty. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs, including Romanian-adapted
models, on this dataset revealed significant performance disparities: models
consistently achieve higher accuracy (80-95%) on international questions
compared to Romanian-specific cultural questions (50-75%). We further
investigate these differences through experiments involving machine translation
of Romanian questions into English and cross-lingual tests using a comparable
dataset in French. Our findings underscore the impact of cultural context and
data source on LLM performance and offer practical insights for building
robust, culturally-aware multilingual NLP systems, especially in educational
domains. The dataset is publicly available at Hugging Face.

Motivation: 研究Chain-of-Thought（CoT）技术在不同任务中效果不一致的机制，探索其与token概率分布单调性的相关性。

Method: 提出基于token概率分布的指标评估CoT效果，结合逻辑回归模型动态选择CoT或直接回答（Dynamic CoT），并扩展到闭源模型。

Result: 评估CoT效果的指标准确率达89.2%，Dynamic CoT减少35%以上token消耗且保持高准确率。

Conclusion: 为CoT机制提供新视角，并提出高效部署框架。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique has proven effective in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks.
However, the performance gains are inconsistent across different tasks, and the
underlying mechanism remains a long-standing research question. In this work,
we make a preliminary observation that the monotonicity of token probability
distributions may be correlated with the gains achieved through CoT reasoning.
Leveraging this insight, we propose two indicators based on the token
probability distribution to assess CoT effectiveness across different tasks. By
combining instance-level indicators with logistic regression model, we
introduce Dynamic CoT, a method that dynamically select between CoT and direct
answer. Furthermore, we extend Dynamic CoT to closed-source models by
transferring decision strategies learned from open-source models. Our
indicators for assessing CoT effectiveness achieve an accuracy of 89.2\%, and
Dynamic CoT reduces token consumption by more than 35\% while maintaining high
accuracy. Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on the underlying
mechanisms of CoT reasoning and provides a framework for its more efficient
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的递归思维能力有限，尤其是在缺乏专家数据蒸馏的情况下，需要一种新方法来释放其潜力。

Method: AvR通过引入批评和改进动作的细化过程，结合可微分学习技术优化细化感知奖励，生成多轮数据作为长细化思维。

Result: 实验显示，AvR仅用3k合成样本就将LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct模型在AlpacaEval 2.0上的胜率提升超过20%。

Conclusion: AvR通过长形式CoT显著提升了LLMs的递归推理能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The OpenAI o1-series models have demonstrated that leveraging long-form Chain
of Thought (CoT) can substantially enhance performance. However, the recursive
thinking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain limited,
particularly in the absence of expert-curated data for distillation. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{AvR}: \textbf{Alignment via Refinement}, a novel
method aimed at unlocking the potential of LLMs for recursive reasoning through
long-form CoT. AvR introduces a refinement process that integrates criticism
and improvement actions, guided by differentiable learning techniques to
optimize \textbf{refinement-aware rewards}. As a result, the synthesized
multi-round data can be organized as a long refinement thought, further
enabling test-time scaling. Experimental results show that AvR significantly
outperforms conventional preference optimization methods. Notably, with only 3k
synthetic samples, our method boosts the performance of the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct
model by over 20\% in win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有代理搜索方法存在优化不足、评估成本高和搜索效率低的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出分层搜索空间、预测值模型和分层MCTS策略，结合任务描述和代理系统设计。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，平均性能提升8.34%，搜索效率更高。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了代理系统的性能和搜索效率，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities
across diverse domains. However, designing high-performing agentic systems
remains challenging. Existing agent search methods suffer from three major
limitations: (1) an emphasis on optimizing agentic workflows while
under-utilizing proven human-designed components such as memory, planning, and
tool use; (2) high evaluation costs, as each newly generated agent must be
fully evaluated on benchmarks; and (3) inefficient search in large search
space. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework to address these
challenges. First, We propose a hierarchical search space that jointly models
agentic workflow and composable functional components, enabling richer agentic
system designs. Building on this structured design space, we introduce a
predictive value model that estimates agent performance given agentic system
and task description, allowing for efficient, low-cost evaluation during the
search process. Finally, we present a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) strategy informed by uncertainty to guide the search. Experiments on
seven benchmarks, covering embodied, math, web, tool, and game, show that our
method achieves an average performance gain of 8.34\% over state-of-the-art
baselines and exhibits faster search progress with steeper improvement
trajectories. Code repo is available at

Result: 在ClashEval基准测试中，SR-DCR显著提升对误导上下文的鲁棒性，同时保持对可信输入的准确性。

Conclusion: SR-DCR是一种轻量级框架，能有效解决语言模型中的上下文冲突问题，且计算开销低。

Abstract: Large language models frequently encounter conflicts between their parametric
knowledge and contextual input, often resulting in factual inconsistencies or
hallucinations. We propose Self-Reflective Debate for Contextual Reliability
(SR-DCR), a lightweight framework that integrates token-level self-confidence
with an asymmetric multi-agent debate to adjudicate such conflicts. A critic,
deprived of context, challenges a defender who argues from the given passage; a
judge model evaluates the debate and determines the context's reliability. The
final answer is selected by combining the verdict with model confidence.
Experiments on the ClashEval benchmark demonstrate that SR-DCR consistently
enhances robustness to misleading context while maintaining accuracy on
trustworthy inputs, outperforming both classical debate and confidence-only
baselines with minimal computational overhead. The code is available at
https://github.com/smiles724/Self-Reflective-Debates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL方法因重复检索大规模数据集导致高计算成本，需改进。

Method: 引入“充分性”和“必要性”指标，设计树状算法高效选择代表性示例。

Result: 实验显示FEEDER能减少20%以上训练数据，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: FEEDER高效且兼容性强，适用于多种下游演示选择策略。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) delivers strong
few-shot performance by choosing few-shot demonstrations from the entire
training data. However, existing ICL methods, which rely on similarity or
diversity scores to choose demonstrations, incur high computational costs due
to repeatedly retrieval from large-scale datasets for each query. To this end,
we propose FEEDER (FEw yet Essential Demonstration prE-selectoR), a novel
pre-selection framework that identifies a representative subset of
demonstrations containing the most representative examples in the training
data, tailored to specific LLMs. To construct this subset, we introduce the
"sufficiency" and "necessity" metrics in the pre-selection stage and design a
tree-based algorithm to identify representative examples efficiently. Once
pre-selected, this representative subset can effectively replace the full
training data, improving efficiency while maintaining comparable performance in
ICL. Additionally, our pre-selected subset also benefits fine-tuning LLMs,
where we introduce a bi-level optimization method that enhances training
efficiency without sacrificing performance. Experiments with LLMs ranging from
300M to 8B parameters show that FEEDER can reduce training data size by over
20% while maintaining performance and seamlessly integrating with various
downstream demonstration selection strategies in ICL.

Result: 现有方法仅能解决少量MATP-BENCH问题，表明该基准具有挑战性。

Conclusion: MATP-BENCH为多模态自动定理证明研究提供了新的挑战和方向。

Abstract: Numerous theorems, such as those in geometry, are often presented in
multimodal forms (e.g., diagrams). Humans benefit from visual reasoning in such
settings, using diagrams to gain intuition and guide the proof process. Modern
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in solving a wide range of mathematical problems. However, the
potential of MLLMs as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs), specifically in the
multimodal domain, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the
Multimodal Automated Theorem Proving benchmark (MATP-BENCH), a new Multimodal,
Multi-level, and Multi-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in this
role as multimodal automated theorem provers. MATP-BENCH consists of 1056
multimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level
mathematics. All these multimodal problems are accompanied by formalizations in
Lean 4, Coq and Isabelle, thus making the benchmark compatible with a wide
range of theorem-proving frameworks. MATP-BENCH requires models to integrate
sophisticated visual understanding with mastery of a broad spectrum of
mathematical knowledge and rigorous symbolic reasoning to generate formal
proofs. We use MATP-BENCH to evaluate a variety of advanced multimodal language
models. Existing methods can only solve a limited number of the MATP-BENCH
problems, indicating that this benchmark poses an open challenge for research
on automated theorem proving.

Result: 实验证明CatShift在无法访问内部概率的情况下仍能有效检测数据集成员资格，适用于开源和API模型。

Conclusion: CatShift为保护专有数据提供了一种实用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
by excelling at interpreting, reasoning about, and generating human language.
However, their reliance on large-scale, often proprietary datasets poses a
critical challenge: unauthorized usage of such data can lead to copyright
infringement and significant financial harm. Existing dataset-inference methods
typically depend on log probabilities to detect suspicious training material,
yet many leading LLMs have begun withholding or obfuscating these signals. This
reality underscores the pressing need for label-only approaches capable of
identifying dataset membership without relying on internal model logits.
  We address this gap by introducing CatShift, a label-only dataset-inference
framework that capitalizes on catastrophic forgetting: the tendency of an LLM
to overwrite previously learned knowledge when exposed to new data. If a
suspicious dataset was previously seen by the model, fine-tuning on a portion
of it triggers a pronounced post-tuning shift in the model's outputs;
conversely, truly novel data elicits more modest changes. By comparing the
model's output shifts for a suspicious dataset against those for a known
non-member validation set, we statistically determine whether the suspicious
set is likely to have been part of the model's original training corpus.
Extensive experiments on both open-source and API-based LLMs validate
CatShift's effectiveness in logit-inaccessible settings, offering a robust and
practical solution for safeguarding proprietary data.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在联邦学习中的记忆能力可能导致数据隐私泄露，尤其是在敏感领域。论文旨在探索这种风险并提出解决方案。

Method: 设计了针对FedLLMs的提取攻击算法，假设攻击者仅能访问单个客户端的数据，并利用上下文前缀提取其他客户端的个人身份信息（PII）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提取高达56.57%的受害者专属PII，其中“地址”、“生日”和“姓名”最易受攻击。

Conclusion: 研究强调了联邦学习中隐私保护的紧迫性，并为未来研究提供了新的基准和评估框架。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of large language models (FedLLMs) presents a promising
approach for achieving strong model performance while preserving data privacy
in sensitive domains. However, the inherent memorization ability of LLMs makes
them vulnerable to training data extraction attacks. To investigate this risk,
we introduce simple yet effective extraction attack algorithms specifically
designed for FedLLMs. In contrast to prior "verbatim" extraction attacks, which
assume access to fragments from all training data, our approach operates under
a more realistic threat model, where the attacker only has access to a single
client's data and aims to extract previously unseen personally identifiable
information (PII) from other clients. This requires leveraging contextual
prefixes held by the attacker to generalize across clients. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our approaches, we propose two rigorous metrics-coverage rate
and efficiency-and extend a real-world legal dataset with PII annotations
aligned with CPIS, GDPR, and CCPA standards, achieving 89.9% human-verified
precision. Experimental results show that our method can extract up to 56.57%
of victim-exclusive PII, with "Address," "Birthday," and "Name" being the most
vulnerable categories. Our findings underscore the pressing need for robust
defense strategies and contribute a new benchmark and evaluation framework for
future research in privacy-preserving federated learning.

Result: ATC在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，并支持多种编程语言（如Python、CPP、Java）。

Conclusion: 任务级别的条件化是检测LLM生成代码的关键，ATC方法具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Detecting Large Language Model (LLM)-generated code is a growing challenge
with implications for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity.
We investigate the role of conditional probability distributions in improving
zero-shot LLM-generated code detection, when considering both the code and the
corresponding task prompt that generated it. Our key insight is that when
evaluating the probability distribution of code tokens using an LLM, there is
little difference between LLM-generated and human-written code. However,
conditioning on the task reveals notable differences. This contrasts with
natural language text, where differences exist even in the unconditional
distributions. Leveraging this, we propose a novel zero-shot detection approach
that approximates the original task used to generate a given code snippet and
then evaluates token-level entropy under the approximated task conditioning
(ATC). We further provide a mathematical intuition, contextualizing our method
relative to previous approaches. ATC requires neither access to the generator
LLM nor the original task prompts, making it practical for real-world
applications. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves state-of-the-art
results across benchmarks and generalizes across programming languages,
including Python, CPP, and Java. Our findings highlight the importance of
task-level conditioning for LLM-generated code detection. The supplementary
materials and code are available at https://github.com/maorash/ATC, including

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法依赖非结构化医疗文本，存在噪声和难以利用的问题，缺乏系统性组织医疗知识的方法。

Method: 提出MIRIAD语料库，通过LLM生成、过滤、接地和人工标注，将医疗文献转化为QA对格式。

Result: 实验表明，MIRIAD提升LLMs在医疗QA基准上的准确性达6.7%，并显著减少幻觉生成。

Conclusion: MIRIAD为医疗领域提供了更可靠的LLM应用基础，支持多种下游任务。

Abstract: LLMs are bound to transform healthcare with advanced decision support and
flexible chat assistants. However, LLMs are prone to generate inaccurate
medical content. To ground LLMs in high-quality medical knowledge, LLMs have
been equipped with external knowledge via RAG, where unstructured medical
knowledge is split into small text chunks that can be selectively retrieved and
integrated into the LLMs context. Yet, existing RAG pipelines rely on raw,
unstructured medical text, which can be noisy, uncurated and difficult for LLMs
to effectively leverage. Systematic approaches to organize medical knowledge to
best surface it to LLMs are generally lacking. To address these challenges, we
introduce MIRIAD, a large-scale, curated corpus of 5,821,948 medical QA pairs,
each rephrased from and grounded in a passage from peer-reviewed medical
literature using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation, filtering,
grounding, and human annotation. Unlike prior medical corpora, which rely on
unstructured text, MIRIAD encapsulates web-scale medical knowledge in an
operationalized query-response format, which enables more targeted retrieval.
Experiments on challenging medical QA benchmarks show that augmenting LLMs with
MIRIAD improves accuracy up to 6.7% compared to unstructured RAG baselines with
the same source corpus and with the same amount of retrieved text. Moreover,
MIRIAD improved the ability of LLMs to detect medical hallucinations by 22.5 to
37% (increase in F1 score). We further introduce MIRIAD-Atlas, an interactive
map of MIRIAD spanning 56 medical disciplines, enabling clinical users to
visually explore, search, and refine medical knowledge. MIRIAD promises to
unlock a wealth of down-stream applications, including medical information
retrievers, enhanced RAG applications, and knowledge-grounded chat interfaces,
which ultimately enables more reliable LLM applications in healthcare.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过与数据库引擎交互（而非监督微调）来优化模型生成SQL查询的能力。

Method: 将问题建模为强化学习任务，利用执行反馈（标量奖励）和GRPO框架进行优化。

Result: RL-tuning将SQL生成准确率从31.49提升至49.83，错误率从25.43%降至14.71%，接近更大模型性能。

Conclusion: 执行反馈可有效提升LLM的符号推理能力。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of code generation with a large language
model (LLM), with a focus on generating SQL queries from natural language
questions. We ask: Instead of using supervised fine tuning with text-code
pairs, can we tune a model by having it interact with a database engine? We
frame this problem as a reinforcement learning problem where the model receives
execution-based feedback from the environment in the form of scalar rewards.
These rewards penalize execution failures and assign positive values when a
query returns a correct answer. We use the rewards within the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework. We use a tabular reasoning benchmark to
test and evaluate our findings. We find that with only weak supervision in the
form of question-answer pairs, RL-tuning improves the accuracy of model
generated SQL code from 31.49 to 49.83 while reducing error percentage from
25.43% to 14.71%. This improvement allowed the model nearly match the

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）能否在主观任务（如仇恨言论检测）中捕捉多视角和反映标注者分歧。通过零样本和少样本设置评估了四种开源LLMs，发现多视角生成在零样本中可行，但少样本设置难以全面反映人类判断。提示设计和演示选择对性能有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在NLP分类任务中表现优异，但通常依赖聚合标签（如多数投票），可能掩盖主观标注中的人类分歧。研究旨在探索LLMs是否能捕捉多视角和反映标注者分歧。

Method: 使用上下文学习（ICL）在零样本和少样本设置下评估四种开源LLMs，比较三种标签建模策略（聚合硬标签、分散硬标签和软标签）。少样本设置中测试了基于文本相似性、标注分歧、组合排名和示例排序策略的演示选择方法。

Result: 多视角生成在零样本设置中可行，但少样本设置难以全面反映人类判断。提示设计和演示选择对性能影响显著，示例排序影响有限。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在建模主观性时的挑战，强调了构建更具视角意识和社会智能模型的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on NLP
classification tasks. However, they typically rely on aggregated labels-often
via majority voting-which can obscure the human disagreement inherent in
subjective annotations. This study examines whether LLMs can capture multiple
perspectives and reflect annotator disagreement in subjective tasks such as
hate speech and offensive language detection. We use in-context learning (ICL)
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, evaluating four open-source LLMs across
three label modeling strategies: aggregated hard labels, and disaggregated hard
and soft labels. In few-shot prompting, we assess demonstration selection
methods based on textual similarity (BM25, PLM-based), annotation disagreement
(entropy), a combined ranking, and example ordering strategies (random vs.
curriculum-based). Results show that multi-perspective generation is viable in
zero-shot settings, while few-shot setups often fail to capture the full
spectrum of human judgments. Prompt design and demonstration selection notably
affect performance, though example ordering has limited impact. These findings
highlight the challenges of modeling subjectivity with LLMs and the importance
of building more perspective-aware, socially intelligent models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种语音纠正系统，通过生成语音替代方案并结合重打分机制，显著提升了E2E ASR模型在识别新电影名称时的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E2E ASR模型依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，导致新电影名称识别效果不佳，需要一种低成本改进方法。

Method: 系统包含语音搜索生成替代方案和重打分组件，结合ASR输出选择最终结果。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在流行电影名称识别任务中相对基线模型降低了4.4%至7.6%的词错误率。

Conclusion: 提出的语音纠正系统有效提升了E2E ASR模型对新内容的识别能力。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are trained using
paired audio-text samples that are expensive to obtain, since high-quality
ground-truth data requires human annotators. Voice search applications, such as
digital media players, leverage ASR to allow users to search by voice as
opposed to an on-screen keyboard. However, recent or infrequent movie titles
may not be sufficiently represented in the E2E ASR system's training data, and
hence, may suffer poor recognition.
  In this paper, we propose a phonetic correction system that consists of (a) a
phonetic search based on the ASR model's output that generates phonetic
alternatives that may not be considered by the E2E system, and (b) a rescorer
component that combines the ASR model recognition and the phonetic
alternatives, and select a final system output.
  We find that our approach improves word error rate between 4.4 and 7.6%
relative on benchmarks of popular movie titles over a series of competitive
baselines.

*Tara Azin,Daniel Dumitrescu,Diana Inkpen,Raj Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了自然语言推理（NLI）模型在处理条件句中的预设推理时的表现，并提出了CONFER数据集用于评估。结果表明，现有NLI模型和大型语言模型（LLMs）在此任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨NLI模型在条件句中的预设推理能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 引入CONFER数据集，评估四种NLI模型和多种LLMs在零样本和少样本提示下的表现。

Result: NLI模型在条件句的预设推理上表现不佳，微调现有数据集未能提升性能。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究以提升模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining whether a
sentence pair represents entailment, contradiction, or a neutral relationship.
While NLI models perform well on many inference tasks, their ability to handle
fine-grained pragmatic inferences, particularly presupposition in conditionals,
remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce CONFER, a novel dataset
designed to evaluate how NLI models process inference in conditional sentences.
We assess the performance of four NLI models, including two pre-trained models,
to examine their generalization to conditional reasoning. Additionally, we
evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, LLaMA, Gemma, and
DeepSeek-R1, in zero-shot and few-shot prompting settings to analyze their
ability to infer presuppositions with and without prior context. Our findings
indicate that NLI models struggle with presuppositional reasoning in
conditionals, and fine-tuning on existing NLI datasets does not necessarily
improve their performance.

TL;DR: 介绍了一个名为semantic-features的库，用于研究语言模型的上下文词嵌入，并通过实验验证其在特定语法结构中对语义解释的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究上下文词嵌入在特定语法结构（如与格结构）中对语义解释的影响，开发一个易于使用的工具来支持此类研究。

Method: 使用semantic-features库，设计包含450对句子的数据集，测试不同与格结构对词嵌入的影响。

Result: 实验表明，三个掩码语言模型的上下文词嵌入表现出预期的敏感性。

Conclusion: semantic-features工具在分析语言模型的语义解释方面具有实用价值。

Abstract: We introduce semantic-features, an extensible, easy-to-use library based on
Chronis et al. (2023) for studying contextualized word embeddings of LMs by
projecting them into interpretable spaces. We apply this tool in an experiment
where we measure the contextual effect of the choice of dative construction
(prepositional or double object) on the semantic interpretation of utterances
(Bresnan, 2007). Specifically, we test whether "London" in "I sent London the
letter." is more likely to be interpreted as an animate referent (e.g., as the
name of a person) than in "I sent the letter to London." To this end, we devise
a dataset of 450 sentence pairs, one in each dative construction, with
recipients being ambiguous with respect to person-hood vs. place-hood. By
applying semantic-features, we show that the contextualized word embeddings of
three masked language models show the expected sensitivities. This leaves us
optimistic about the usefulness of our tool.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级多代理流程，将图表描述转换为可执行代码的错误率从15%降至4.5%，但发现仍需改进图表的美观性、语义保真度和可访问性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在生成可执行图表代码时的高错误率（15%）是否源于模型限制或单提示设计，并提出解决方案。

Method: 采用多代理流程（起草、执行、修复和判断），使用现成的GPT-4o-mini模型，在Text2Chart31和ChartX基准测试中验证。

Result: 错误率降至4.5%（Text2Chart31）和4.6%（ChartX），但发现图表存在幻觉和可访问性问题。

Conclusion: 未来工作应关注图表美观性、语义保真度和可访问性，而非仅执行可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models can translate natural-language chart descriptions into
runnable code, yet approximately 15\% of the generated scripts still fail to
execute, even after supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We
investigate whether this persistent error rate stems from model limitations or
from reliance on a single-prompt design. To explore this, we propose a
lightweight multi-agent pipeline that separates drafting, execution, repair,
and judgment, using only an off-the-shelf GPT-4o-mini model. On the
\textsc{Text2Chart31} benchmark, our system reduces execution errors to 4.5\%
within three repair iterations, outperforming the strongest fine-tuned baseline
by nearly 5 percentage points while requiring significantly less compute.
Similar performance is observed on the \textsc{ChartX} benchmark, with an error
rate of 4.6\%, demonstrating strong generalization. Under current benchmarks,
execution success appears largely solved. However, manual review reveals that 6
out of 100 sampled charts contain hallucinations, and an LLM-based
accessibility audit shows that only 33.3\% (\textsc{Text2Chart31}) and 7.2\%
(\textsc{ChartX}) of generated charts satisfy basic colorblindness guidelines.
These findings suggest that future work should shift focus from execution
reliability toward improving chart aesthetics, semantic fidelity, and
accessibility.

Motivation: 解决语音钓鱼检测中缺乏转录数据的问题，并探索小语言模型在对抗性条件下的性能差异。

Method: 微调Llama3，设计VP评估标准，应用CoT技术，构建对抗性测试数据集，生成VP转录数据。

Result: 微调后的Llama3-8B在小语言模型中表现最佳，性能接近GPT-4。

Conclusion: 在语音钓鱼检测中，将专家知识融入提示比CoT技术对小语言模型更有效。

Abstract: We develop a voice phishing (VP) detector by fine-tuning Llama3, a
representative open-source, small language model (LM). In the prompt, we
provide carefully-designed VP evaluation criteria and apply the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. To evaluate the robustness of LMs and
highlight differences in their performance, we construct an adversarial test
dataset that places the models under challenging conditions. Moreover, to
address the lack of VP transcripts, we create transcripts by referencing
existing or new types of VP techniques. We compare cases where evaluation
criteria are included, the CoT technique is applied, or both are used together.
In the experiment, our results show that the Llama3-8B model, fine-tuned with a
dataset that includes a prompt with VP evaluation criteria, yields the best
performance among small LMs and is comparable to that of a GPT-4-based VP
detector. These findings indicate that incorporating human expert knowledge
into the prompt is more effective than using the CoT technique for small LMs in
VP detection.

Motivation: 研究开放性和创造性推理能力在复杂、多模态问题中的表现，填补现有基准测试的不足。

Method: 引入PuzzleWorld基准，包含详细标注的谜题和推理痕迹，用于评估和诊断模型性能。

Result: 当前模型表现差（1-2%准确率），但微调推理痕迹可提升步进推理能力（从4%到11%）。

Conclusion: PuzzleWorld为开发更通用的开放性和创造性推理系统提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined
problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks
consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to
discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and
iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,
exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent
progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings
remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a
large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess
step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is
annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive
skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic
analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,
with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise
accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that
fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from
4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near
zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,
are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack
sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release
PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on
building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.

envision future physics-specialized LLMs that could handle multimodal data,
propose testable hypotheses, and design experiments. Realizing this vision
requires addressing fundamental challenges: ensuring physical consistency, and
developing robust verification methods. We call for collaborative efforts

Motivation: 在线性别歧视检测面临数据稀疏性和语言细微差别的挑战，现有模型在数据不平衡和类别模糊性上表现不佳。

Method: 提出定义数据增强（DDA）和上下文语义扩展（CSE）两种数据增强技术，并结合多语言模型的集成策略。

Result: 在EDOS数据集上，二元分类任务（Task A）和细粒度分类任务（Task C）的宏F1分别提高了1.5和4.1分。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法有效提升了性别歧视检测的性能，尤其是在数据不平衡和语言细微差别的情况下。

Abstract: The detection of sexism in online content remains an open problem, as harmful
language disproportionately affects women and marginalized groups. While
automated systems for sexism detection have been developed, they still face two
key challenges: data sparsity and the nuanced nature of sexist language. Even
in large, well-curated datasets like the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism
(EDOS), severe class imbalance hinders model generalization. Additionally, the
overlapping and ambiguous boundaries of fine-grained categories introduce
substantial annotator disagreement, reflecting the difficulty of interpreting
nuanced expressions of sexism. To address these challenges, we propose two
prompt-based data augmentation techniques: Definition-based Data Augmentation
(DDA), which leverages category-specific definitions to generate
semantically-aligned synthetic examples, and Contextual Semantic Expansion
(CSE), which targets systematic model errors by enriching examples with
task-specific semantic features. To further improve reliability in fine-grained
classification, we introduce an ensemble strategy that resolves prediction ties
by aggregating complementary perspectives from multiple language models. Our
experimental evaluation on the EDOS dataset demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance across all tasks, with notable improvements of macro F1 by 1.5
points for binary classification (Task A) and 4.1 points for fine-grained
classification (Task C).

TL;DR: DSSP-RAG框架通过混合注意力机制和认知不确定性检测，解决了RAG中外部知识与LLMs内部知识的冲突问题，提升了生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法因外部知识与LLMs内部知识冲突而性能下降，缺乏冲突解决机制。

Method: 提出DSSP-RAG框架，采用混合注意力区分共享与私有语义，引入认知不确定性检测和能量商（EQ）减少外部知识噪声。

Result: 实验表明DSSP-RAG能有效解决知识冲突，增强双流知识互补性，性能优于基线。

Conclusion: DSSP-RAG通过创新机制提升了RAG的稳定性和性能，为知识冲突问题提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a cost-effective approach to mitigate
the hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating the
retrieved external knowledge into the generation process. However, external
knowledge may conflict with the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Furthermore,
current LLMs lack inherent mechanisms for resolving such knowledge conflicts,
making traditional RAG methods suffer from degraded performance and stability.
Thus, we propose a Dual-Stream Knowledge-Augmented Framework for Shared-Private
Semantic Synergy (DSSP-RAG). Central to the framework is a novel approach that
refines self-attention into a mixed-attention, distinguishing shared and
private semantics for a controlled internal-external knowledge integration. To
effectively facilitate DSSP in RAG, we further introduce an unsupervised
hallucination detection method based on cognitive uncertainty, ensuring the
necessity of introducing knowledge, and an Energy Quotient (EQ) based on
attention difference matrices to reduce noise in the retrieved external
knowledge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that DSSP-RAG can
effectively resolve conflicts and enhance the complementarity of dual-stream
knowledge, leading to superior performance over strong baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Cartridge的方法，通过离线训练小型KV缓存来替代传统的大语言模型上下文学习（ICL），显著降低了内存消耗和推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大语言模型在处理长上下文时，内存消耗大且成本高，因此需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出Cartridge方法，通过离线训练小型KV缓存，并使用自学习（self-study）生成合成对话进行训练。

Result: Cartridge在性能上与ICL相当，但内存消耗减少38.6倍，吞吐量提高26.4倍，并能扩展有效上下文长度。

Conclusion: Cartridge方法是一种高效且经济的替代方案，适用于长上下文任务，并支持推理时组合。

Abstract: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text
corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the
entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL).
Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is
costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with
input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on
each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a
Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge
can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,
we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token
prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose
self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations
about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.
We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of
ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context
benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while
using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also
extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on
MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference
time without retraining.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本摘要中表现优异，但存在预训练数据中的偏见问题，导致下游任务输出不公平。

Method: AdvSumm引入Perturber组件，在序列到序列模型的嵌入层应用梯度引导扰动，增强模型对输入变化的鲁棒性。

Result: AdvSumm有效减少了名称-国籍偏见和政治框架偏见，且在基准数据集上优于标准Transformer和数据增强方法。

Conclusion: AdvSumm在减少偏见的同时不损害摘要质量，是一种有效的领域无关训练框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications.
However, these systems often inherit associative and framing biases from
pre-training data, leading to inappropriate or unfair outputs in downstream
tasks. In this work, we present AdvSumm (Adversarial Summarization), a
domain-agnostic training framework designed to mitigate bias in text
summarization through improved generalization. Inspired by adversarial
robustness, AdvSumm introduces a novel Perturber component that applies
gradient-guided perturbations at the embedding level of Sequence-to-Sequence
models, enhancing the model's robustness to input variations. We empirically
demonstrate that AdvSumm effectively reduces different types of bias in
summarization-specifically, name-nationality bias and political framing
bias-without compromising summarization quality. Compared to standard
transformers and data augmentation techniques like back-translation, AdvSumm
achieves stronger bias mitigation performance across benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: GPT-4V在图像取证领域展示了强大的零样本能力，特别是在检测图像拼接操作中，准确率超过85%。通过不同的提示策略（零样本、少样本和思维链），模型表现出对低级视觉伪影和上下文知识的利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索GPT-4V在图像取证中的零样本能力，尤其是检测图像拼接操作，以评估其作为通用工具的潜力。

Method: 使用三种提示策略（零样本、少样本和思维链）在CASIA v2.0拼接数据集上评估GPT-4V的性能。

Result: GPT-4V在零样本设置下达到85%以上的准确率，思维链提示在真实和拼接图像间表现最平衡。模型还能利用上下文知识识别不合理合成。

Conclusion: 尽管GPT-4V不及专用模型，但其通用性、可解释性和推理能力使其成为图像取证中的灵活工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning
across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex
vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the
out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics,
specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any
task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies:
Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a
curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in
zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the
most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative
analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual
artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object
scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible
composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing
detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic
reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions are critical indicators of both
environmental impact and various industrial processes, including livestock

Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions
across diverse applications. Our approach integrates a multi-scale context

dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates
(10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions
from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CarboNeXT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving

*Tinglin Huang,Tianyu Liu,Mehrtash Babadi,Wengong Jin,Rex Ying*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STFlow是一种基于流匹配的生成模型，通过建模整个切片的基因表达联合分布来考虑细胞间相互作用，解决了现有方法在内存和独立性假设上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学（ST）技术结合组织学成像和基因表达分析，但受限于低通量和专业设施需求。现有预测方法未能有效建模细胞间相互作用且面临内存问题。

Method: 提出STFlow，采用流匹配生成模型建模整个切片的基因表达联合分布，并结合高效的切片级编码器和局部空间注意力机制。

Result: 在HEST-1k和STImage-1K4M基准测试中，STFlow显著优于现有方法，相对病理基础模型提升超过18%。

Conclusion: STFlow通过改进建模方式和内存效率，为空间转录组学数据分析提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for
bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its
application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized
experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide
histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they
factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene
expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with
memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in
typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative
model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution
of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level
encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without
excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M
benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种种子选择方法，通过从多个候选种子中选择最优种子，在不增加比特率的情况下提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要额外信息传输以实现可扩展性，而现有扩散方法虽避免了这一点，但使用单一随机种子可能导致图像质量不佳。

Method: 基于反向扩散过程的早期中间输出，从多个候选种子中选择最优种子。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的种子选择方法有效提升了图像质量，且未增加比特率。

Abstract: Conventional methods for scalable image coding for humans and machines
require the transmission of additional information to achieve scalability. A
recent diffusion-based method avoids this by generating human-oriented images
from machine-oriented images without extra bitrate. This method, however, uses
a single random seed, which may lead to suboptimal image quality. In this
paper, we propose a seed selection method that identifies the optimal seed from
multiple candidates to improve image quality without increasing the bitrate. To
reduce computational cost, the selection is performed based on intermediate
outputs obtained from early steps of the reverse diffusion process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: 该方法通过微调和优化策略，有效解决了立体图像生成的挑战。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach to generate stereo
images given a text prompt. Since stereo image datasets with large baselines
are scarce, training a diffusion model from scratch is not feasible. Therefore,
we propose leveraging the strong priors learned by Stable Diffusion and
fine-tuning it on stereo image datasets to adapt it to the task of stereo
generation. To improve stereo consistency and text-to-image alignment, we
further tune the model using prompt alignment and our proposed stereo
consistency reward functions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our approach in generating high-quality stereo images across
diverse scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have opened the door to new research
perspectives in the domain of art and cultural heritage, where a large number
of artifacts have been digitized. There is a need for innovation to ease the
access and highlight the content of digital collections. Such innovations
develop into creative explorations of the digital image in relation to its
malleability and contemporary interpretation, in confrontation to the original
historical object. Based on the concept of the autonomous image, we propose a
new framework towards the production of self-explaining cultural artifacts
using open-source large-language, face detection, text-to-speech and
audio-to-animation models. The goal is to start from a digitized artwork and to
automatically assemble a short video of the latter where the main character
animates to explain its content. The whole process questions cultural biases
encapsulated in large-language models, the potential of digital images and
deepfakes of artworks for educational purposes, along with concerns of the
field of art history regarding such creative diversions.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is critical for optimal policy design in dynamic

novel neural architecture that integrates spatial feature extraction using

Abstract: Rapid spread of false images and videos on online platforms is an emerging
problem. Anyone may add, delete, clone or modify people and entities from an
image using various editing software which are readily available. This
generates false and misleading proof to hide the crime. Now-a-days, these false
and counterfeit images and videos are flooding on the internet. These spread
false information. Many methods are available in literature for detecting those
counterfeit contents but new methods of counterfeiting are also evolving.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are observed to be one effective method
as it modifies the context and definition of images producing plausible results
via image-to-image translation. This work uses an independent discriminant
network that can identify GAN generated image or video. A discriminant network
has been created using a convolutional neural network based on
InceptionResNetV2. The article also proposes a platform where users can detect
forged images and videos. This proposed work has the potential to help the
forensics domain to detect counterfeit videos and hidden criminal evidence

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most revolutionary inventions
of 21st century. At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that
uses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are
quadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with
opposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service
in the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national
security. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part
of the national security and provide the most valuable service during
surveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals,
there reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such
as signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust
hardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs
to be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision
algorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of
deep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos
for the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer
vision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed
suitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate
judgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors
have proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through
various algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the
purpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense
area exploration, traffic vehicle surveillance etc.

Conclusion: ViT和ResNet结合的方法在公平人脸认证中有效，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Biometric face authentication is crucial in computer vision, but ensuring
fairness and generalization across demographic groups remains a big challenge.
Therefore, we investigated whether Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet,
leveraging pre-trained global features, can fairly authenticate different
demographic faces while relying minimally on local features. In this
investigation, we used three pre-trained state-of-the-art (SOTA) ViT foundation
models from Facebook, Google, and Microsoft for global features as well as
ResNet-18. We concatenated the features from ViT and ResNet, passed them
through two fully connected layers, and trained on customized face image
datasets to capture the local features. Then, we designed a novel few-shot
prototype network with backbone features embedding. We also developed new
demographic face image support and query datasets for this empirical study. The
network's testing was conducted on this dataset in one-shot, three-shot, and
five-shot scenarios to assess how performance improves as the size of the
support set increases. We observed results across datasets with varying
races/ethnicities, genders, and age groups. The Microsoft Swin Transformer
backbone performed better among the three SOTA ViT for this task. The code and
data are available at: https://github.com/Sufianlab/FairVitBio.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将质量评分和推理描述作为分离任务优化，导致评分准确性和解释性之间的权衡，限制了模型潜力。

Method: 两阶段框架：冷启动阶段通过专家设计的提示从教师模型蒸馏数据；强化学习微调阶段引入新奖励机制（GRPO）联合优化评分准确性和推理一致性。

Result: Q-Ponder在质量评分回归基准上达到SOTA性能（SRCC提升6.5%），并在描述准确性和合理性上显著优于基于描述的SOTA模型。

Conclusion: Q-Ponder框架成功统一评分与解释性任务，展示了在多任务中的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can
proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments.
However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning
descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading
to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with
precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability.
This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality
assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing.
To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a
cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage.
Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher
model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via
cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize
scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived
from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show
that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score
regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain
datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based
SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in
description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization
potential over diverse tasks.

Result: 在TVSum20和SumMe数据集上，TriPSS表现优于传统单模态和多模态方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: TriPSS通过捕捉视觉和语义的细微信息，为大规模视频内容理解设定了新基准。

Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization
and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains
challenging. In this work, we present TriPSS, a novel tri-modal framework that
effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space,
deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from
frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing
these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs
robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video
content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating
quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set
is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art
performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous
multi-modal methods. These results underscore TriPSS's ability to capture
nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for
video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios.

Motivation: 当前分割模型（如SAM和SAM-HQ）在处理复杂形状物体（如电线、自行车等）时表现不佳，尤其是对细长结构和精细边界的分割效果较差。

Method: Talk2SAM利用用户提供的文本提示生成CLIP嵌入，并将其投影到DINO特征空间，作为SAM-HQ的额外提示，从而增强对目标物体的分割能力。

Result: 在BIG、ThinObject5K和DIS5K三个基准测试中，Talk2SAM相比SAM-HQ实现了最高5.9%的IoU和8.3%的边界IoU提升。

Conclusion: Talk2SAM通过自然语言引导提供了一种灵活且有效的方法，显著提升了复杂形状物体的分割精度。

Abstract: Segmenting objects with complex shapes, such as wires, bicycles, or
structural grids, remains a significant challenge for current segmentation
models, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its high-quality variant
SAM-HQ. These models often struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries,
leading to poor segmentation quality. We propose Talk2SAM, a novel approach
that integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of such challenging
objects. The method uses CLIP-based embeddings derived from user-provided text
prompts to identify relevant semantic regions, which are then projected into
the DINO feature space. These features serve as additional prompts for SAM-HQ,
enhancing its ability to focus on the target object. Beyond improving
segmentation accuracy, Talk2SAM allows user-controllable segmentation, enabling
disambiguation of objects within a single bounding box based on textual input.
We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks: BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K.
Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving up to +5.9\% IoU and +8.3\%
boundary IoU improvements. Our results demonstrate that incorporating natural
language guidance provides a flexible and effective means for precise object
segmentation, particularly in cases where traditional prompt-based methods
fail. The source code is available on GitHub:

Abstract: Image captioning involves generating textual descriptions from input images,
bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language processing.
Recent advancements in transformer-based models have significantly improved
caption generation by leveraging attention mechanisms for better scene
understanding. While various surveys have explored deep learning-based
approaches for image captioning, few have comprehensively analyzed
attention-based transformer models across multiple languages. This survey
reviews attention-based image captioning models, categorizing them into
transformer-based, deep learning-based, and hybrid approaches. It explores
benchmark datasets, discusses evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr,
and ROUGE, and highlights challenges in multilingual captioning. Additionally,
this paper identifies key limitations in current models, including semantic
inconsistencies, data scarcity in non-English languages, and limitations in
reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions, such as
multimodal learning, real-time applications in AI-powered assistants,
healthcare, and forensic analysis. This survey serves as a comprehensive

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly
common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency
and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical
driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit
over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident
predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE,
an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous
driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We
evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets,
including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle
running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple
VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum
improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy,
with maximum gains of up to 44%.

Abstract: In robot scientific laboratories, visual anomaly detection is important for
the timely identification and resolution of potential faults or deviations. It
has become a key factor in ensuring the stability and safety of experimental
processes. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a VLM-based visual
reasoning approach that supports different levels of supervision through four
progressively informative prompt configurations. To systematically evaluate its
effectiveness, we construct a visual benchmark tailored for process anomaly
detection in scientific workflows. Experiments on two representative
vision-language models show that detection accuracy improves as more contextual
information is provided, confirming the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed reasoning approach for process anomaly detection in scientific
workflows. Furthermore, real-world validations at selected experimental steps
confirm that first-person visual observation can effectively identify
process-level anomalies. This work provides both a data-driven foundation and
an evaluation framework for vision anomaly detection in scientific experiment
workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ODIS是一种预训练方法，通过对象级自蒸馏改进视觉表示，解决了现有方法假设图像仅含单一对象的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉预训练方法假设图像仅含单一对象，限制了在复杂场景数据集上的扩展性。ODIS旨在通过对象级自蒸馏提升表示能力。

Method: ODIS采用对象感知裁剪和掩码注意力，隔离对象区域，将场景级任务分解为对象级子任务。

Result: ODIS在ViT-Large上实现了82.6%的k-NN准确率，显著提升了图像和补丁级别的视觉表示。

Conclusion: ODIS通过对象级自蒸馏有效提升了视觉表示能力，适用于复杂场景数据集。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level
self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly
assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always
hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits
scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity.
We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation
(ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity
from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked
attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer
toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level
task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves
visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at
inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on
ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

TL;DR: 研究评估了111个视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视线推断任务中的表现，发现大多数模型表现不佳，而人类表现接近完美。少数表现较好的VLMs受任务难度影响，但对感知变化稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视线推断是人类与AI自然交互的关键能力，研究旨在评估VLMs在此任务中的表现。

Method: 通过控制实验，比较111个VLMs和65名人类参与者在不同难度和变异性照片中的表现，并使用混合效应模型分析行为。

Result: 94个VLMs表现不如随机猜测，人类表现接近完美。少数表现较好的VLMs受任务难度影响但对感知变化稳健。

Conclusion: VLMs目前缺乏视线推断能力，但仍有潜力成为与人类自然交互的技术。

Abstract: Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking
at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI
interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision
Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and
variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65),
and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 of the 111
VLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved
near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally
frequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we
zoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find
that their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only
slightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features
cannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they
likely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance
is subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations. This
suggests that VLMs, lacking gaze inference capability, have yet to become
technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential
remains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAVVY-Bench是首个针对动态3D场景中空间推理的基准测试，结合了同步空间音频。SAVVY是一种无需训练的两阶段推理方法，显著提升了现有AV-LLMs的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AV-LLMs和基准测试主要关注静态或2D场景，而动态3D空间推理尚未充分探索。

Method: SAVVY分为两个阶段：(i) 利用AV-LLMs和其他视听方法追踪关键对象的轨迹；(ii) 构建全局动态地图并通过坐标转换回答问题。

Result: 实验表明，SAVVY显著提升了现有AV-LLMs的性能。

Conclusion: SAVVY为动态3D空间推理设定了新标准，推动了AV-LLMs的发展。

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone
of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual
Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on
static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D
spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio.
SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and
moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D
localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose
SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:
(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as
other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to
the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map
Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and
converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a
final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the
global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a
new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

Motivation: STEP格式需要CAD内核处理，导致许可证成本高，限制了CAD数据在机器学习中的大规模应用。

Method: 开发了基于HDF5的开放格式，并提供了开源库和数据集，支持采样、法线和曲率等标准功能。

Result: 成功转换了Fusion 360和ABC数据集，并通过四个标准用例验证了数据的完整性和与原STEP文件的一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的HDF5格式和工具显著提升了CAD数据在机器学习中的可用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) generated from computer-aided design (CAD) is
widely used in industry, with several large datasets available. However, the
data in these datasets is represented in STEP format, requiring a CAD kernel to
read and process it. This dramatically limits their scope and usage in large
learning pipelines, as it constrains the possibility of deploying them on
computing clusters due to the high cost of per-node licenses.
  This paper introduces an alternative format based on the open, cross-platform
format HDF5 and a corresponding dataset for STEP files, paired with an
open-source library to query and process them. Our Python package also provides
standard functionalities such as sampling, normals, and curvature to ease
integration in existing pipelines.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our format, we converted the Fusion 360
dataset and the ABC dataset. We developed four standard use cases (normal
estimation, denoising, surface reconstruction, and segmentation) to assess the
integrity of the data and its compliance with the original STEP files.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉强化学习中，图像常包含任务无关的干扰（如阴影、云、光线），尤其是在训练中未暴露的干扰下，需要高效且鲁棒的表示方法。

Method: 设计了Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD)方法，通过并行使用弱增强和强增强，预测双向增强版本间的逆向和正向转换来学习表示。

Result: 在MuJoCo视觉控制任务和CARLA自动驾驶任务中，SPD在复杂观察和未见观察的泛化性能上优于先前研究。

Conclusion: SPD能有效提取任务相关特征，显著提升视觉强化学习在干扰环境中的表现。

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust
representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain
distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It
becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training.
We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant
features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak
and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting
inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set
of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD
outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly
improves the generalization performance for unseen observations. Our code is

Motivation: 解决现有MBRL算法在面对视觉干扰时性能下降的问题，适应现实场景中常见的任务无关干扰。

Method: 使用双对比学习训练编码器和世界模型，引入递归状态逆动力学模型以增强时间结构理解。

Result: 在DeepMind Control和Robosuite中，Dr. G分别比现有方法性能提升117%和14%。

Conclusion: Dr. G显著提升了MBRL在视觉干扰下的泛化能力，适用于复杂现实场景。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve
vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although
recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when
faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant
distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in
real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method,
Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and
world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures
task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a
recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better
understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the
robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the
generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then
test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and
the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance
improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works, respectively. Our code is

Motivation: 现有RF-based MPPE方法存在计算复杂度高或性能不足的问题，本文旨在设计一种更高效且准确的解决方案。

Method: 通过分组处理原始RF信号，使用共享单层CNN和多头注意力机制，结合自监督学习预测掩码数据的潜在表示。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和准确性上均优于现有技术，自监督学习进一步提升了泛化能力，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: In the field of Multi-Person Pose Estimation (MPPE), Radio Frequency
(RF)-based methods can operate effectively regardless of lighting conditions
and obscured line-of-sight situations. Existing RF-based MPPE methods typically
involve either 1) converting RF signals into heatmap images through complex
preprocessing, or 2) applying a deep embedding network directly to raw RF
signals. The first approach, while delivering decent performance, is
computationally intensive and time-consuming. The second method, though simpler
in preprocessing, results in lower MPPE accuracy and generalization
performance. This paper proposes an efficient and lightweight one-stage MPPE
model based on raw RF signals. By sub-grouping RF signals and embedding them
using a shared single-layer CNN followed by multi-head attention, this model
outperforms previous methods that embed all signals at once through a large and
deep CNN. Additionally, we propose a new self-supervised learning (SSL) method
that takes inputs from both one unmasked subgroup and the remaining masked
subgroups to predict the latent representations of the masked data. Empirical
results demonstrate that our model improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15 in
PCKh@0.5 compared to previous methods using raw RF signals. Especially, the
proposed SSL method has shown to significantly enhance performance improvements
when placed in new locations or in front of obstacles at RF antennas,
contributing to greater performance gains as the number of people increases.

Motivation: 人类社交互动的复杂性和多模态特性对人工智能提出了挑战，需要开发更先进的评估工具。

Method: 通过2,792个视频片段和8,792个问题-答案对，结合人类与LLM协作生成数据，覆盖多样化的视频类型和文化背景。

Result: 实验显示MLLMs在SSU表现良好，但在SSR和SDP上表现不佳，关系推理（RI）是主要瓶颈。转录对话对理解复杂社交互动至关重要。

Conclusion: SIV-Bench为开发更具社交智能的AI提供了关键见解，并公开了数据集和代码。

Abstract: The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing
multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical
behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To
advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark
for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR),
and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and
8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM
collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube,
covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and
cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the
impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no
text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models
adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where
Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our
analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in
aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically
identifying current MLLMs' strengths and limitations, SIV-Bench offers crucial
insights to steer the development of more socially intelligent AI. The dataset

Motivation: 视觉-语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答等任务中表现优异，但其对微小扰动的鲁棒性不足，尤其是在部署场景中。因此，需要一种方法来评估和提升这些模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为视觉-语言模型的鲁棒性评估提供了新方法，并展示了多模态对抗攻击的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks
such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to
traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a
challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating
the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and
language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we
train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and
generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial
perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack
strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning
datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results
indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and
single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate
their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art
pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

Conclusion: 该方法为视频分类模型的鲁棒性评估提供了更有效和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging,
specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal
dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational
cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to
induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify
the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider
temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more
effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method
enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant
to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action
recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

Result: CLIP视觉表征提供语义信息，语言解码器能补偿视觉表征不足。

Conclusion: 未来可设计更多将视觉处理任务转移给语言解码器的架构。

Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of
multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have
various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language
backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by
contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform
controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our
findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer
ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in
scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the
language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover
performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates
future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language
decoder.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a
broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and
are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate
them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading
charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However,
such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do
not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception,
reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology,
inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of
synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal
perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with
gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number
of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant.
This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure
analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and
interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities. Our code is available at

Result: FastDrive在决策任务上准确率提升20%，推理速度提升10倍，同时验证了场景标注对决策任务的重要性。

Conclusion: 结构化数据集和高效模型FastDrive显著提升了自动驾驶任务的性能和效率。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end
autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However,
troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving
applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely
formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce
redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs
hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this
paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which
is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured
representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with
0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and
unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands
structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving
decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive
achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20%
accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive
parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally,
ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g.,
weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance
on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote

learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence
speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this
type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on
two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically,
we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining
the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that
mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore,
cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased
stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR

Abstract: Image degradation is a prevalent issue in various real-world applications,
affecting visual quality and downstream processing tasks. In this study, we
propose a novel framework that employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
automatically classify degraded images into predefined categories. The VLM
categorizes an input image into one of four degradation types: (A)
super-resolution degradation (including noise, blur, and JPEG compression), (B)
reflection artifacts, (C) motion blur, or (D) no visible degradation
(high-quality image). Once classified, images assigned to categories A, B, or C
undergo targeted restoration using dedicated models tailored for each specific
degradation type. The final output is a restored image with improved visual
quality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
accurately classifying image degradations and enhancing image quality through
specialized restoration models. Our method presents a scalable and automated
solution for real-world image enhancement tasks, leveraging the capabilities of
VLMs in conjunction with state-of-the-art restoration techniques.

Abstract: Changing facial expressions, gestures, or background details may dramatically
alter the meaning conveyed by an image. Notably, recent advances in diffusion
models greatly improve the quality of image manipulation while also opening the
door to misuse. Identifying changes made to authentic images, thus, becomes an
important task, constantly challenged by new diffusion-based editing tools. To
this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted
AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features
from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive
loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these
techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its
generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic
evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with
images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR
achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and
localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models. Our code,
data and models will be publicly available at alex-costanzino.github.io/radar.

TL;DR: S2GO提出了一种基于稀疏查询的3D表示方法，通过动态传播和解码为语义高斯，显著提升了效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D占用预测方法依赖密集表示（如体素或高斯），速度慢且难以捕捉动态场景。

Method: 使用紧凑的3D查询集动态传播，并解码为语义高斯，结合去噪渲染目标优化。

Result: 在nuScenes和KITTI基准测试中表现最优，IoU提升1.5，推理速度快5.9倍。

Conclusion: 稀疏查询表示在效率和性能上优于密集表示，适用于动态场景建模。

Abstract: Despite the demonstrated efficiency and performance of sparse query-based
representations for perception, state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction
methods still rely on voxel-based or dense Gaussian-based 3D representations.
However, dense representations are slow, and they lack flexibility in capturing
the temporal dynamics of driving scenes. Distinct from prior work, we instead
summarize the scene into a compact set of 3D queries which are propagated
through time in an online, streaming fashion. These queries are then decoded
into semantic Gaussians at each timestep. We couple our framework with a
denoising rendering objective to guide the queries and their constituent
Gaussians in effectively capturing scene geometry. Owing to its efficient,
query-based representation, S2GO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
nuScenes and KITTI occupancy benchmarks, outperforming prior art (e.g.,
GaussianWorld) by 1.5 IoU with 5.9x faster inference.

Abstract: Removing reflections is a crucial task in computer vision, with significant
applications in photography and image enhancement. Nevertheless, existing
methods are constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and
diverse datasets. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark for Single Image
Reflection Removal (SIRR). We have developed a large-scale dataset containing
5,300 high-quality, pixel-aligned image pairs, each consisting of a reflection
image and its corresponding clean version. Specifically, the dataset is divided
into two parts: 5,000 images are used for training, and 300 images are used for
validation. Additionally, we have included 100 real-world testing images
without ground truth (GT) to further evaluate the practical performance of
reflection removal methods. All image pairs are precisely aligned at the pixel
level to guarantee accurate supervision. The dataset encompasses a broad
spectrum of real-world scenarios, featuring various lighting conditions, object
types, and reflection patterns, and is segmented into training, validation, and
test sets to facilitate thorough evaluation. To validate the usefulness of our
dataset, we train a U-Net-based model and evaluate it using five widely-used
metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS, and NIQE. We will release both the
dataset and the code on https://github.com/caijie0620/OpenRR-5k to facilitate
future research in this field.

Abstract: Visual attention is a mechanism closely intertwined with vision and memory.
Top-down information influences visual processing through attention. We
designed a neural network model inspired by aspects of human visual attention.
This model consists of two networks: one serves as a basic processor performing
a simple task, while the other processes contextual information and guides the
first network through attention to adapt to more complex tasks. After training
the model and visualizing the learned attention response, we discovered that
the model's emergent attention patterns corresponded to spatial and
feature-based attention. This similarity between human visual attention and
attention in computer vision suggests a promising direction for studying human
cognition using neural network models.

Result: VR-INR在未见过的尺度和噪声条件下保持高质量重建，在清晰度、细节保留和去噪效果上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VR-INR展示了隐式神经表示在视频修复中的强大泛化能力和灵活性。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) videos play a crucial role in many computer vision
applications. Although existing video restoration (VR) methods can
significantly enhance video quality by exploiting temporal information across
video frames, they are typically trained for fixed upscaling factors and lack
the flexibility to handle scales or degradations beyond their training
distribution. In this paper, we introduce VR-INR, a novel video restoration
approach based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that is trained only
on a single upscaling factor ($\times 4$) but generalizes effectively to
arbitrary, unseen super-resolution scales at test time. Notably, VR-INR also
performs zero-shot denoising on noisy input, despite never having seen noisy
data during training. Our method employs a hierarchical
spatial-temporal-texture encoding framework coupled with multi-resolution
implicit hash encoding, enabling adaptive decoding of high-resolution and
noise-suppressed frames from low-resolution inputs at any desired
magnification. Experimental results show that VR-INR consistently maintains
high-quality reconstructions at unseen scales and noise during training,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in sharpness, detail
preservation, and denoising efficacy.

Motivation: 现实场景中的反射复杂多样，现有方法难以有效处理，需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用U形架构，结合FFT Transformer块（利用全局频率信息）和分层Transformer块（多尺度特征提取），以处理不同大小和复杂度的反射。

Result: 在三个公开测试数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: F2T2-HiT架构通过结合频率域和多尺度信息，有效解决了SIRR问题。

Abstract: Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR) technique plays a crucial role in
image processing by eliminating unwanted reflections from the background. These
reflections, often caused by photographs taken through glass surfaces, can
significantly degrade image quality. SIRR remains a challenging problem due to
the complex and varied reflections encountered in real-world scenarios. These
reflections vary significantly in intensity, shapes, light sources, sizes, and
coverage areas across the image, posing challenges for most existing methods to
effectively handle all cases. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces a U-shaped Fast Fourier Transform Transformer and Hierarchical
Transformer (F2T2-HiT) architecture, an innovative Transformer-based design for
SIRR. Our approach uniquely combines Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Transformer
blocks and Hierarchical Transformer blocks within a UNet framework. The FFT
Transformer blocks leverage the global frequency domain information to
effectively capture and separate reflection patterns, while the Hierarchical
Transformer blocks utilize multi-scale feature extraction to handle reflections
of varying sizes and complexities. Extensive experiments conducted on three
publicly available testing datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance,
validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 现有自回归模型在文本到图像生成中表现接近扩散模型，但在细粒度文本-图像对齐上表现不佳，无法实现精确的视觉标记控制。

Method: 提出FocusDiff方法，构建包含相似表达但局部语义不同的文本-图像对数据集，并设计强化学习算法以强调细粒度语义差异。

Result: FocusDiff在现有文本到图像基准测试中达到最优性能，并在PairComp基准上显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: FocusDiff通过强化细粒度语义对齐，显著提升了文本到图像生成的精确控制能力。

Abstract: Recent studies extend the autoregression paradigm to text-to-image
generation, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models. However, our
new PairComp benchmark -- featuring test cases of paired prompts with similar
syntax but different fine-grained semantics -- reveals that existing models
struggle with fine-grained text-image alignment thus failing to realize precise
control over visual tokens. To address this, we propose FocusDiff, which
enhances fine-grained text-image semantic alignment by focusing on subtle
differences between similar text-image pairs. We construct a new dataset of
paired texts and images with similar overall expressions but distinct local
semantics, further introducing a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to
emphasize such fine-grained semantic differences for desired image generation.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing text-to-image
benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods on PairComp.

TL;DR: MORSE-500是一个新的视频基准测试，旨在解决现有多模态推理基准测试的不足，包括静态图像、狭窄的问题范围和易饱和性。它包含500个脚本生成的视频片段，覆盖六种推理能力，并通过可控生成支持持续挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在时间复杂性、推理能力广度和难度扩展性方面存在不足，无法全面评估多模态模型的推理能力。

Method: 使用Python脚本（Manim、Matplotlib、MoviePy）、生成视频模型和真实素材，程序化生成500个视频片段，嵌入六类推理问题，并支持难度动态调整。

Result: 实验显示，当前最先进的模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro和OpenAI o3）在所有推理类别中表现不佳，尤其在抽象和规划任务上差距显著。

Conclusion: MORSE-500为多模态推理研究提供了透明、可扩展的评估工具，支持未来模型的持续改进。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks
for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they
overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal
complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on
mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning
skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal
capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many
benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure
modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal
Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully
scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning
categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic
Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and
curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control
over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling
difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static
benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:
its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily
challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing
next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --
including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest
available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal
substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large
deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset,
generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent,
reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

Motivation: 现有基于概念的神经网络解释存在概念不一致问题，且缺乏用户反馈机制，影响了模型解释的可理解性和用户满意度。

Method: 提出YoursProtoP，通过用户监督调整和拆分原型部分（视觉概念），使其更符合用户偏好和理解。

Result: 在FunnyBirds、CUB、CARS和PETS数据集上的实验表明，YoursProtoP在保持模型准确性的同时实现了概念一致性。

Conclusion: YoursProtoP有效解决了概念不一致问题，并通过用户交互提升了模型解释的可理解性。

Abstract: Concept-based interpretable neural networks have gained significant attention
due to their intuitive and easy-to-understand explanations based on case-based
reasoning, such as "this bird looks like those sparrows". However, a major
limitation is that these explanations may not always be comprehensible to users
due to concept inconsistency, where multiple visual features are
inappropriately mixed (e.g., a bird's head and wings treated as a single
concept). This inconsistency breaks the alignment between model reasoning and
human understanding. Furthermore, users have specific preferences for how
concepts should look, yet current approaches provide no mechanism for
incorporating their feedback. To address these issues, we introduce
YoursProtoP, a novel interactive strategy that enables the personalization of
prototypical parts - the visual concepts used by the model - according to user
needs. By incorporating user supervision, YoursProtoP adapts and splits
concepts used for both prediction and explanation to better match the user's
preferences and understanding. Through experiments on both the synthetic
FunnyBirds dataset and a real-world scenario using the CUB, CARS, and PETS
datasets in a comprehensive user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
YoursProtoP in achieving concept consistency without compromising the accuracy
of the model.

Motivation: 现有图像编码器（如DINO、CLIP）缺乏时间感知，而视频模型（如VideoMAE）在密集预测任务中表现不佳，因此需要一种兼顾时空一致性和密集预测能力的视频编码器。

Method: FRAME通过自监督学习，从过去和当前RGB帧预测当前和未来的DINO补丁特征，生成时空精确且一致的表示，并支持CLIP语义空间对齐。

Result: 在七个数据集的六项密集预测任务中，FRAME均优于图像编码器和现有自监督视频模型，同时保持紧凑架构。

Conclusion: FRAME填补了密集视频预测任务的编码器空白，兼具时空一致性和密集预测能力，适用于多种下游应用。

Abstract: Dense video prediction tasks, such as object tracking and semantic
segmentation, require video encoders that generate temporally consistent,
spatially dense features for every frame. However, existing approaches fall
short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video
models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense
prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame
encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current
and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to
spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge,
FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense
prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual
correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with
CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video
classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven
datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing
self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a
compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.

Motivation: 尽管3D视觉技术在静态场景中表现良好，但在动态现象（如移动物体分割）中效果不佳。本文旨在解决这一问题，探索3D技术如何提升动态场景的2D分析。

Result: 3D模型的分割预测显著优于2D基线，证明了3D技术即使在动态场景中也能提升2D分析效果。

Conclusion: 研究表明，3D技术可以在复杂动态场景中有效增强2D分析，为动态现象的研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques, with 3D vision still
relegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However, by building
on recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors
have shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from
independent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is
particularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is
significant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In
fact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques
are ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in
particular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this
issue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D
by fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered
radiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,
dynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric
structure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the
(incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time
refinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing
the data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the
refinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that
surpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques
can enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and
realistic setting.

Conclusion: 通过分析语义幻觉的成因并提出针对性解决方案，论文为提升多模态模型在复杂场景中的鲁棒性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in visual
perception and reasoning. However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or
non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand
the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually
incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work,
we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a
key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene
text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we
propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising
two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies
potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer
Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers
less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs
for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To
enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of over
1,730 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually
curated question-answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic
hallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for
scene text spotting and understanding.

Abstract: Generating high-quality camera-controllable videos from monocular input is a
challenging task, particularly under extreme viewpoint. Existing methods often
struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts in boundaries,
leading to degraded visual quality. In this paper, we introduce EX-4D, a novel
framework that addresses these challenges through a Depth Watertight Mesh
representation. The representation serves as a robust geometric prior by
explicitly modeling both visible and occluded regions, ensuring geometric
consistency in extreme camera pose. To overcome the lack of paired multi-view
datasets, we propose a simulated masking strategy that generates effective
training data only from monocular videos. Additionally, a lightweight
LoRA-based video diffusion adapter is employed to synthesize high-quality,
physically consistent, and temporally coherent videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
physical consistency and extreme-view quality, enabling practical 4D video
generation.

Abstract: Radiance field methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) allow easy
reconstruction from photos, enabling free-viewpoint navigation. Nonetheless,
pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still
each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete.
SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera
baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera
poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense
and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes.
To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned
features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct
sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning
primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two
efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian
primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing
scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives,
storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives
are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint.
We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution
can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes
we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle
specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.

significant challenges due to specific difficulties, e.g., occlusions and
unbalanced dynamic environments. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and
their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization
framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D
Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced
Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method
decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them
onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the
camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D
semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene
flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow
of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent
frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy
models, enhancing performance without increasing inference time. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat
in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

TL;DR: PartCrafter是一个统一的3D生成模型，能够从单张RGB图像同时生成多个语义明确且几何上独立的3D网格，无需依赖预分割输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么生成单一3D形状，要么采用两阶段流程（先分割图像再重建每个部分），PartCrafter旨在通过统一的组合生成架构解决这些问题。

Method: PartCrafter基于预训练的3D网格扩散变换器（DiT），引入组合潜在空间和分层注意力机制，实现端到端的部分感知生成。

Result: 实验表明，PartCrafter在生成可分解3D网格方面优于现有方法，包括输入图像中不可见的部分。

Conclusion: PartCrafter展示了部分感知生成先验在3D理解和合成中的优势，代码和训练数据将公开。

Abstract: We introduce PartCrafter, the first structured 3D generative model that
jointly synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful and geometrically distinct
3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods that either produce
monolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an
image and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified,
compositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented
inputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D
parts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and
complex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh
diffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained
weights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A
compositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of
disentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables
structured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,
ensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.
To support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level
annotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that
PartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D
meshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images,
demonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding
and synthesis. Code and training data will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为UniRes的扩散框架，用于处理复杂退化图像恢复问题，通过结合多个专用模型在扩散采样步骤中，实现了对复杂退化图像的有效恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图像恢复面临多种退化问题，现有方法难以泛化到真实场景。本文专注于解决复杂退化（多种已知退化的任意混合）问题。

Method: 提出UniRes框架，结合多个专用模型在扩散采样步骤中，利用孤立训练数据实现复杂退化恢复。框架灵活，支持扩展和调整保真度-质量权衡。

Result: 在复杂退化和单一退化数据集上评估，实验结果显示性能显著提升，尤其在复杂退化图像上表现突出。

Conclusion: UniRes框架有效解决了复杂退化图像恢复问题，具有灵活性和扩展性，为真实场景图像恢复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Real-world image restoration is hampered by diverse degradations stemming
from varying capture conditions, capture devices and post-processing pipelines.
Existing works make improvements through simulating those degradations and
leveraging image generative priors, however generalization to in-the-wild data
remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we focus on complex degradations,
i.e., arbitrary mixtures of multiple types of known degradations, which is
frequently seen in the wild. A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework,
named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner.
It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps,
hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks
to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires
well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is
flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the
fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm. Our proposed
method is evaluated on both complex-degradation and single-degradation image
restoration datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental
results show consistent performance gain especially for images with complex
degradations.

Result: 实验表明该方法在所有退化任务中均表现优越。

Conclusion: 通过任务定义、不平衡量化和数据再平衡的协同优化，显著提升了Real-SR的性能。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-SR) is a challenging problem due to
the complex degradation patterns in low-resolution images. Unlike approaches
that assume a broadly encompassing degradation space, we focus specifically on
achieving an optimal balance in how SR networks handle different degradation
patterns within a fixed degradation space. We propose an improved paradigm that
frames Real-SR as a data-heterogeneous multi-task learning problem, our work
addresses task imbalance in the paradigm through coordinated advancements in
task definition, imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing.
Specifically, we introduce a novel task definition framework that segments the
degradation space by setting parameter-specific boundaries for degradation
operators, effectively reducing the task quantity while maintaining task
discrimination. We then develop a focal loss based multi-task weighting
mechanism that precisely quantifies task imbalance dynamics during model
training. Furthermore, to prevent sporadic outlier samples from dominating the
gradient optimization of the shared multi-task SR model, we strategically
convert the quantified task imbalance into controlled data rebalancing through
deliberate regulation of task-specific training volumes. Extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistent
superiority across all degradation tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种迭代视觉接地框架，利用大语言模型（LLM）作为结构化关系先验，以解决视觉关系检测（VRD）中固定谓词集限制的问题。该方法通过交替生成候选场景图和训练视觉模型，实现了对未标注关系的泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VRD模型依赖固定谓词集，难以泛化到新交互关系。本文旨在通过结合LLM和视觉模型，提升对未标注关系的理解能力。

Method: 采用期望最大化（EM）启发的方法，交替使用LLM生成候选场景图（期望步骤）和训练视觉模型对齐感知证据（最大化步骤）。

Result: 在Visual Genome的新基准测试中，模型在谓词分类任务上表现优于基线方法，平均召回率（mR@50）分别为15.9（已见）、13.1（未见）和11.7（混合）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于LLM的视觉接地框架能够有效扩展开放世界视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding relationships between objects is central to visual
intelligence, with applications in embodied AI, assistive systems, and scene
understanding. Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a
fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key
challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but
unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work
introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by
expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating
candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and
training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence
(maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond
annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally,
we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21
held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed.
Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving
mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on
these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors
for scalable open-world visual understanding.

TL;DR: ADR-MVS是一种自适应深度范围的多视角立体方法，通过单目几何线索改进深度估计，适用于航空图像，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视航空与近景图像的差异（如深度范围变化和低细节特征匹配），导致深度估计不准确。

Method: 提出ADR-MVS，结合深度范围预测器和交叉注意力差异学习，逐步优化深度范围，并设计法线引导的成本聚合和深度细化模块。

Result: 在WHU、LuoJia-MVS和München数据集上达到最优性能，且计算复杂度更低。

Conclusion: ADR-MVS通过自适应深度范围和法线引导技术，显著提升了航空图像的多视角立体重建效果。

Abstract: Three-dimensional digital urban reconstruction from multi-view aerial images
is a critical application where deep multi-view stereo (MVS) methods outperform
traditional techniques. However, existing methods commonly overlook the key
differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth
ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with
low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive
Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve
multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth
range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal
estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the
range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth
boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating
convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are
progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for
precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation
is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness
within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement
module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results
demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU,
LuoJia-MVS, and M\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational
complexity.

Motivation: 颅外组织在脑MRI中可能对健康状态和临床决策具有重要价值，但目前工具缺乏广泛验证，尤其是在发育中大脑或病理情况下。

Method: TissUnet基于155对MRI-CT扫描训练，并在涵盖广泛年龄范围（包括脑肿瘤患者）的九个数据集中验证。

Result: TissUnet在健康成人队列中的中位Dice系数为0.79，在专家手动标注的验证中为0.83（健康个体）和0.81（肿瘤病例），优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TissUnet能够快速、准确且可重复地分割颅外组织，支持大规模研究，如颅面形态、治疗效果和心脏代谢风险。

Abstract: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may
hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical
decision-making, yet they are rarely quantified. Current tools have not been
widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying
pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone,
subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI,
with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired
MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering
a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to
AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice
coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second
validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR:
0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted
in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and
TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review
(N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations.
TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial
tissues, supporting large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology, treatment
effects, and cardiometabolic risk using standard brain T1w MRI.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but
existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level
annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address
these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark
specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from
2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data
proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to
ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete
action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and
implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that
explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both
comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language
guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3%
without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without
either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks
with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous
foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Effectively representing 3D scenes for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is crucial yet challenging. Existing approaches commonly only rely on
2D image features and use varied tokenization approaches. This work presents a
rigorous study of 3D token structures, systematically comparing video-based and
point-based representations while maintaining consistent model backbones and
parameters. We propose a novel approach that enriches visual tokens by
incorporating 3D point cloud features from a Sonata pretrained Point
Transformer V3 encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that merging explicit 3D
features significantly boosts performance. Furthermore, we show that
point-based token structures can rival video-based ones when the points are
cleverly sampled and ordered. Our best models from both structures achieve
state-of-the-art results on multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. We emphasize
our analysis of token structures as a key contribution, alongside transparent
reporting of results averaged over multiple seeds, a practice we believe is
vital for robust progress in the field.

Result: 显式道德监督提高了单模态和多模态对道德内容的理解能力。

Conclusion: MoralCLIP为具备道德意识的AI系统奠定了基础，能够识别并与人类道德价值观对齐。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled rich semantic
understanding across modalities. However, these encoding methods lack the
ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial
aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal
learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT).
Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding
space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the
multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral
foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data
augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs
labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit
moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral
content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of
recognizing and aligning with human moral values.

Conclusion: 该框架为token压缩提供了更优的计算-性能权衡，显著降低了计算成本和推理时间。

Abstract: Vision transformers have been widely explored in various vision tasks. Due to
heavy computational cost, much interest has aroused for compressing vision
transformer dynamically in the aspect of tokens. Current methods mainly pay
attention to token pruning or merging to reduce token numbers, in which tokens
are compressed exclusively, causing great information loss and therefore
post-training is inevitably required to recover the performance. In this paper,
we rethink token reduction and unify the process as an explicit form of token
matrix transformation, in which all existing methods are constructing special
forms of matrices within the framework. Furthermore, we propose a many-to-many
Token Transforming framework that serves as a generalization of all existing
methods and reserves the most information, even enabling training-free
acceleration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework.
Specifically, we reduce 40% FLOPs and accelerate DeiT-S by $\times$1.5 with
marginal 0.1% accuracy drop. Furthermore, we extend the method to dense
prediction tasks including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation,
and language model generation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently achieves substantial improvements, offering a better
computation-performance trade-off, impressive budget reduction and inference
acceleration.

Conclusion: YOEO方法在实时性和计算效率上优于现有方法，展示了在机器人操作任务中的实用性和有效性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for
articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown
promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level.
However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that
first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the
Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These
approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in
real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a
single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS
representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate
point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same
part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering
algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances.
Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the
separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size.
Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation
capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our
synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual
feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen
articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our
proposed method.

Method: 通过理论分析、实验验证和统计相关性研究（Pearson系数）比较两种指标。

Result: 理论证明和实验均表明两种指标独立且无相关性。

Conclusion: 加权FOM不能替代Rosin指标，因为两者评估结果不一致。

Abstract: Many studies had been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a
digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for further processing
required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared
their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the
goodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was
pointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason
and this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure
called merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal
approximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness
of an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit
as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An
attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -
weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be
used instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,
experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The
mathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are
analyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are
independent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments
carried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis. The statistical
analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient also establishes that the two
measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a
sub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal
scheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn
using weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit
instead of Rosin's measure.

consistency. We evaluated our method on four synthetic and three real datasets

Method: 引入了一个VQA数据集，分为真实错觉和虚假错觉，并评估LVLMs在区分实际和表观特征上的表现。

Result: 尽管LVLMs能正确回答关于两种特征类型的问题，但它们对真实和虚假错觉问题的回答相同，表明其回答可能基于先验知识而非真正的视觉理解。

Conclusion: LVLMs可能依赖先验知识而非视觉理解来识别错觉，揭示了其在视觉认知上的局限性。

Abstract: Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools
for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision
studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision
language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions.
However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished
actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine
cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question
answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along
with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies
between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same
actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar
geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and
fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and
apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to
recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types,
they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA
questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge
of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available

*Meng Fan,Yifan Zuo,Patrick Blaes,Harley Montgomery,Subhasis Das*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决传感器数据延迟问题的新方法，通过时间戳偏移特征和数据增强策略，提升了自动驾驶感知系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器数据的不同步（staleness）会导致目标状态估计不一致，严重影响轨迹预测质量，从而威胁自动驾驶的安全性。

Method: 方法包括：（1）为LiDAR和雷达数据添加相对于相机的时间戳偏移特征；（2）模拟实际车辆中传感器延迟模式的数据增强策略。

Result: 实验表明，传统模型在传感器数据不同步时性能显著下降，而新方法在同步和不同步条件下均表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法具有模型无关性，能有效提升传感器融合的鲁棒性，适用于多传感器自动驾驶系统。

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in
autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors
arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal
misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state
estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are
critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address
this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar
both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor
fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor
staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into
a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple
LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model
shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach
reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale
conditions.

Abstract: This report presents our solution to the Ego4D Natural Language Queries (NLQ)
Challenge at CVPR 2025. Egocentric video captures the scene from the wearer's
perspective, where gaze serves as a key non-verbal communication cue that
reflects visual attention and offer insights into human intention and
cognition. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach, GazeNLQ, which
leverages gaze to retrieve video segments that match given natural language
queries. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning-based pretraining
strategy for gaze estimation directly from video. The estimated gaze is used to
augment video representations within proposed model, thereby enhancing
localization accuracy. Experimental results show that GazeNLQ achieves
R1@IoU0.3 and R1@IoU0.5 scores of 27.82 and 18.68, respectively. Our code is

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have gained wide adoption in the virtual human
generation due to their outstanding expressiveness. However, their substantial
computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time
interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration
requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video
generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges.
Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the
minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions,
which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a
consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure
real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization
and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference
speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and
model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for
long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and
low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate
class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking,
listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for
fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent
capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
low-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX
4090D, our model achieves a maximum of 78 FPS at a resolution of 384x384 and 45
FPS at a resolution of 512x512, with an initial video generation latency of 140
ms and 215 ms, respectively.

Result: 在四个3D血管分割数据集上的实验证明了DeformCL的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: DeformCL在血管提取中表现出色，具有临床意义，代码已开源。

Abstract: In the field of 3D medical imaging, accurately extracting and representing
the blood vessels with curvilinear structures holds paramount importance for
clinical diagnosis. Previous methods have commonly relied on discrete
representation like mask, often resulting in local fractures or scattered
fragments due to the inherent limitations of the per-pixel classification
paradigm. In this work, we introduce DeformCL, a new continuous representation
based on Deformable Centerlines, where centerline points act as nodes connected
by edges that capture spatial relationships. Compared with previous
representations, DeformCL offers three key advantages: natural connectivity,
noise robustness, and interaction facility. We present a comprehensive training
pipeline structured in a cascaded manner to fully exploit these favorable
properties of DeformCL. Extensive experiments on four 3D vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.
Furthermore, the visualization of curved planar reformation images validates
the clinical significance of the proposed framework. We release the code in

Motivation: 传统UNet的跳跃连接缺乏不同尺度特征间的有效交互，且依赖简单的拼接或加法操作，限制了信息的高效整合。

Method: 提出了一种基于线性多步法的自适应常微分方程方法，将跳跃连接视为离散节点，实现多尺度特征融合。

Result: 在多个医学图像分割数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提高了特征利用率，减少了网络参数，同时保持了高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法独立于编码器和解码器架构，适用于各种UNet类网络，为医学图像分割提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet
serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is
the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant
limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different
scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which
constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet
have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations
remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale
feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an
initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By
leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive
ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature
fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures,
making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC,
KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets
demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and
maintained high performance. The code is available at

Motivation: 事件视觉传感器数据流中存在大量噪声，受光照和传感器温度等因素影响，需高效滤波解决方案。

Method: 设计了DIF滤波器硬件架构并在FPGA上实现，同时发布了高分辨率事件数据集用于评估。

Result: 吞吐量达403.39 MEPS（1280x720）和428.45 MEPS（640x480），AUROC指数0.844-0.999，优于现有方案。

Conclusion: DIF滤波器在高吞吐量和宽噪声范围内表现优异，与现有方案相当但更高效。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been rapid development in the field of event
vision. It manifests itself both on the technical side, as better and better
event sensors are available, and on the algorithmic side, as more and more
applications of this technology are proposed and scientific papers are
published. However, the data stream from these sensors typically contains a
significant amount of noise, which varies depending on factors such as the
degree of illumination in the observed scene or the temperature of the sensor.
We propose a hardware architecture of the Distance-based Interpolation with
Frequency Weights (DIF) filter and implement it on an FPGA chip. To evaluate
the algorithm and compare it with other solutions, we have prepared a new
high-resolution event dataset, which we are also releasing to the community.
Our architecture achieved a throughput of 403.39 million events per second
(MEPS) for a sensor resolution of 1280 x 720 and 428.45 MEPS for a resolution
of 640 x 480. The average values of the Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (AUROC) index ranged from 0.844 to 0.999, depending on the
dataset, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art filtering solutions, but
with much higher throughput and better operation over a wide range of noise
levels.

TL;DR: FontAdapter是一个快速生成未见字体视觉文本的框架，通过两阶段课程学习实现高效字体定制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对预设字体外的适配计算成本高，难以实时定制，FontAdapter旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段课程学习：先学习从孤立字形提取字体属性，再将其融入自然背景；构建合成数据集支持训练。

Result: FontAdapter能在秒级内完成未见字体的高质量定制，支持视觉文本编辑、字体风格混合和跨语言字体转换。

Conclusion: FontAdapter是一个高效、通用的字体定制框架，无需推理时微调即可适应新字体。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the seamless
integration of visual text into diverse image contexts. Recent approaches
further improve control over font styles through fine-tuning with predefined
font dictionaries. However, adapting unseen fonts outside the preset is
computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes, making real-time
customization impractical. In this paper, we present FontAdapter, a framework
that enables visual text generation in unseen fonts within seconds, conditioned
on a reference glyph image. To this end, we find that direct training on font
datasets fails to capture nuanced font attributes, limiting generalization to
new glyphs. To overcome this, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning
approach: FontAdapter first learns to extract font attributes from isolated
glyphs and then integrates these styles into diverse natural backgrounds. To
support this two-stage training scheme, we construct synthetic datasets
tailored to each stage, leveraging large-scale online fonts effectively.
Experiments demonstrate that FontAdapter enables high-quality, robust font
customization across unseen fonts without additional fine-tuning during
inference. Furthermore, it supports visual text editing, font style blending,
and cross-lingual font transfer, positioning FontAdapter as a versatile
framework for font customization tasks.

Abstract: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation
approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence
Challenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view),
the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective
(e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion
module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and
textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the
visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object
alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives,
thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed
method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object

Conclusion: ChronoTailor通过创新的注意力机制和特征融合，实现了高质量的视频虚拟试穿。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly replace the clothing of a person in a
source video with a target garment. Despite significant progress in this field,
existing approaches still struggle to maintain continuity and reproduce garment
details. In this paper, we introduce ChronoTailor, a diffusion-based framework
that generates temporally consistent videos while preserving fine-grained
garment details. By employing a precise spatio-temporal attention mechanism to
guide the integration of fine-grained garment features, ChronoTailor achieves
robust try-on performance. First, ChronoTailor leverages region-aware spatial
guidance to steer the evolution of spatial attention and employs an
attention-driven temporal feature fusion mechanism to generate more continuous
temporal features. This dual approach not only enables fine-grained local
editing but also effectively mitigates artifacts arising from video dynamics.
Second, ChronoTailor integrates multi-scale garment features to preserve
low-level visual details and incorporates a garment-pose feature alignment to
ensure temporal continuity during dynamic motion. Additionally, we collect
StyleDress, a new dataset featuring intricate garments, varied environments,
and diverse poses, offering advantages over existing public datasets, and will
be publicly available for research. Extensive experiments show that
ChronoTailor maintains spatio-temporal continuity and preserves garment details
during motion, significantly outperforming previous methods.

Result: 在217名患者的验证集上，32张多光照图像比单张常规光照图像显著提高准确性。

Conclusion: 多光照条件图像显著提升过敏检测的准确性，优于传统单光照方法。

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing
sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)
device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32
images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which
leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected
inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate
wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by
drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT
device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a
custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural
network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an
algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the
wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation
set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted
image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions
offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional,
uniform light.

Result: 实验表明，CryoFastAR在合成和真实数据集上与传统方法相比，推理速度显著提升且质量相当。

Conclusion: CryoFastAR为冷冻电镜中的快速初始重建提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pose estimation from unordered images is fundamental for 3D reconstruction,
robotics, and scientific imaging. Recent geometric foundation models, such as
DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in
scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for
near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D
reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming
iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise
ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We
introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly
predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By
integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM
data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose
estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we
propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract
essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing
difficulty to improve robustness. Experiments show that CryoFastAR achieves
comparable quality while significantly accelerating inference over traditional
iterative approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

Motivation: 现有数据增强和生成方法在跨域少样本目标检测中效果有限，难以同时保证视觉真实性和域对齐。

Result: 实验表明Domain-RAG在多个任务中表现优异，优于基线方法并达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: Domain-RAG为跨域少样本目标检测提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel objects
with only a handful of labeled samples from previously unseen domains. While
data augmentation and generative methods have shown promise in few-shot
learning, their effectiveness for CD-FSOD remains unclear due to the need for
both visual realism and domain alignment. Existing strategies, such as
copy-paste augmentation and text-to-image generation, often fail to preserve
the correct object category or produce backgrounds coherent with the target
domain, making them non-trivial to apply directly to CD-FSOD. To address these
challenges, we propose Domain-RAG, a training-free, retrieval-guided
compositional image generation framework tailored for CD-FSOD. Domain-RAG
consists of three stages: domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided
background generation, and foreground-background composition. Specifically, the
input image is first decomposed into foreground and background regions. We then
retrieve semantically and stylistically similar images to guide a generative
model in synthesizing a new background, conditioned on both the original and
retrieved contexts. Finally, the preserved foreground is composed with the
newly generated domain-aligned background to form the generated image. Without
requiring any additional supervision or training, Domain-RAG produces
high-quality, domain-consistent samples across diverse tasks, including
CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD. Extensive experiments show
consistent improvements over strong baselines and establish new

*Daming Wang,Yuhao Song,Zijian He,Kangliang Chen,Xing Pan,Lu Deng,Weihao Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM) 是一种端到端驾驶框架，采用认知启发的快慢架构，结合视觉语言模型生成高级意图，并通过三项升级优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过结合快慢架构，实现低延迟的高级别驾驶决策，提升自动驾驶系统的表现。

Method: 1. 选择性五视角提示与历史运动学数据；2. 多阶段链式思维提示；3. 基于样条的轨迹后处理。

Result: 在Waymo Open Dataset上训练，Rater Feedback Score (RFS) 达到7.7367，超越基线2.77%。

Conclusion: HMVLM在2025 Waymo挑战赛中表现优异，验证了其架构和升级的有效性。

Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving
framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow
architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake
commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates
high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck"
without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective
five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2)
multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene
Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and
(3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and
sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to
achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025
Waymo Vision-based End-to-End (E2E) Driving Challenge and surpassing the public
baseline by 2.77%.

### [152] [Unleashing the Potential of Consistency Learning for Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05890)
*Yiheng Li,Yang Yang,Zichang Tan,Huan Liu,Weihua Chen,Xu Zhou,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CSCL的新方法，通过捕捉局部内容的细粒度一致性来提升多模态媒体篡改检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在探索局部内容的细粒度一致性方面不足，导致对篡改细节的感知不充分，结果不可靠。

Method: 设计了图像和文本模态的两个分支，分别包含Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD)和Semantic Consistency Decoder (SCD)，以捕捉模态内上下文一致性和跨模态语义一致性。

Result: 在DGM4数据集上的实验表明，CSCL取得了最先进的性能，尤其是在定位篡改内容方面。

Conclusion: CSCL通过细粒度一致性学习显著提升了多模态媒体篡改检测的效果。

Abstract: To tackle the threat of fake news, the task of detecting and grounding
multi-modal media manipulation DGM4 has received increasing attention. However,
most state-of-the-art methods fail to explore the fine-grained consistency
within local content, usually resulting in an inadequate perception of detailed
forgery and unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
named Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the
fine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and
text modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders,
i.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder
(SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality
semantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same
criteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each
module first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional
supervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair. Then, the
forgery-aware reasoning or aggregating is adopted to deeply seek forgery cues
based on the consistency features. Extensive experiments on DGM4 datasets prove
that CSCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially for the results
of grounding manipulated content. Codes and weights are avaliable at

*Xin Zhang,Dongdong Meng,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的Mask2Former模型，结合可变形注意力和偏移调整策略，显著提升了医学图像分割性能，特别是在中小器官上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割在临床应用中至关重要，但现有方法（如Transformer）在中小器官分割上表现不佳，且计算资源需求高。

Method: 采用Mask2Former结合可变形注意力，提出偏移调整策略以优化采样点位置，并利用第4特征图和FCN辅助头加速训练。

Result: 在HaNSeg和SegRap2023数据集上达到SOTA性能，尤其在中小器官分割上表现突出。

Conclusion: 改进的Mask2Former模型有效解决了医学图像分割中的资源需求和性能问题，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical segmentation plays an important role in clinical applications like
radiation therapy and surgical guidance, but acquiring clinically acceptable
results is difficult. In recent years, progress has been witnessed with the
success of utilizing transformer-like models, such as combining the attention
mechanism with CNN. In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can
extract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of
CNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer
architecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be
resource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the
medical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with
compact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using
ViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\%,
which is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\%. In this paper,
we used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and
proposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the
same organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact
foreground information better. Additionally, we utilized the 4th feature map in
Mask2Former to provide a coarse location of organs, and employed an FCN-based
auxiliary head to help train Mask2Former more quickly using Dice loss. We show
that our model achieves SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance on the HaNSeg and
SegRap2023 datasets, especially on mid-sized and small organs.Our code is

### [154] [Rethinking Semi-supervised Segmentation Beyond Accuracy: Reliability and Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05917)
*Steven Landgraf,Markus Hillemann,Markus Ulrich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估指标RSS，用于衡量半监督语义分割模型的准确性、校准性和不确定性质量，并呼吁在评估中更全面地考虑可靠性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前半监督语义分割的评估仅关注准确性，忽略了可靠性和鲁棒性，而这些特性对安全关键应用（如自动驾驶）至关重要。

Method: 引入了Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS)，通过谐波平均结合预测准确性、校准性和不确定性质量。

Result: 实验表明，半监督方法在可靠性上存在不足，而UniMatchV2在鲁棒性上表现较好。

Conclusion: 呼吁在评估协议中采用更全面的指标（如RSS），以更好地满足实际部署需求。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly
pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised
approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised
segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world
deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively
focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and
robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse
conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as
meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable
environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we
introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines
predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a
harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing
an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models.
Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a
supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability
for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's
robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We
advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like
RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world
deployment needs.

*Yixuan Zhu,Haolin Wang,Shilin Ma,Wenliang Zhao,Yansong Tang,Lei Chen,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FADE是一种无需训练的高效视频编辑方法，通过频率感知分解利用预训练视频扩散模型的先验知识，解决了传统方法在动态视频编辑中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像扩散模型在视频动态编辑（如运动调整）中表现不足，而现有视频扩散模型因计算量大难以直接应用图像编辑技术。

Method: FADE通过分析视频模型的注意力模式，揭示视频先验分布，提出分解策略优化组件角色，并结合频谱引导调制优化采样轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，FADE能高质量、真实且时间一致地完成视频编辑，效果优于传统方法。

Conclusion: FADE为视频编辑提供了一种高效、无需训练的解决方案，显著提升了动态编辑的质量和效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video
editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts.
However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in
handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like
motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality
results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy
computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image
editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a
training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages
the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware
factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the
attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are
distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose
a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role.
Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling
trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and
supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and
temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that
our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally
coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOGO是一个高效实时的3D运动生成框架，通过MoSA-VQ和RQHC-Transformer实现高质量、低延迟的运动生成，并在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的运动生成方法在同时实现高保真、实时响应和可扩展性方面仍存在挑战。

Method: MOGO包含MoSA-VQ（自适应残差向量量化模块）和RQHC-Transformer（残量化层次因果Transformer），并引入文本条件对齐机制。

Result: 在HumanML3D等数据集上，MOGO在生成质量和实时性能上优于现有方法，且支持零样本泛化。

Conclusion: MOGO在高效实时运动生成方面取得了显著进展，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to
impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless,
jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time
responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,
we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive
framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO
comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual
vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences
with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and
(2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that
generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly
reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce
a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under
textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including
HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or
superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based
methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance,
streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dy3DGS-SLAM是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的SLAM方法，专为动态场景设计，仅需单目RGB输入，通过融合光流和深度掩码解决动态干扰，实现了优于现有RGB-D方法的跟踪与渲染性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于NeRF或3D高斯泼溅的SLAM方法在静态场景表现优异，但在动态环境中（如含移动元素的真实场景）表现不佳，且多数依赖RGB-D输入。Dy3DGS-SLAM旨在解决这些问题，支持纯RGB输入并提升动态场景性能。

Method: 提出融合光流掩码和深度掩码的概率模型，生成动态掩码；设计运动损失约束位姿估计网络；在映射阶段利用动态像素的渲染损失、颜色和深度消除瞬态干扰与遮挡。

Result: 实验表明，Dy3DGS-SLAM在动态环境中实现了最先进的跟踪与渲染性能，优于或匹配现有RGB-D方法。

Conclusion: Dy3DGS-SLAM为动态场景SLAM提供了高效解决方案，仅需RGB输入，显著提升了动态干扰处理能力。

Abstract: Current Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods based on Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting excel in reconstructing static
3D scenes but struggle with tracking and reconstruction in dynamic
environments, such as real-world scenes with moving elements. Existing
NeRF-based SLAM approaches addressing dynamic challenges typically rely on
RGB-D inputs, with few methods accommodating pure RGB input. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic
interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a
probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network
iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry.
Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain
the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss
of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and
occlusion caused by dynamic objects. Experimental results demonstrate that
Dy3DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic
environments, outperforming or matching existing RGB-D methods.

Motivation: 农业计算机视觉中，域偏移问题限制了模型的跨域泛化能力，DA技术因其潜力成为研究热点。

Method: 系统回顾了DA在农业图像中的最新进展，包括浅层和深度学习模型，以及监督、半监督和无监督方法，特别关注对抗学习。

Conclusion: 本文为研究者提供了全面框架，指出了当前研究空白，支持DA方法在农业图像分析中的进一步发展。

Abstract: With the increasing use of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has
become crucial for tasks like crop health monitoring and pest detection.
However, significant domain shifts between source and target domains-due to
environmental differences, crop types, and data acquisition methods-pose
challenges. These domain gaps limit the ability of models to generalize across
regions, seasons, and complex agricultural environments. This paper explores
how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges, focusing on
their role in enhancing the cross-domain transferability of agricultural image
analysis. DA has gained attention in agricultural vision tasks due to its
potential to mitigate domain heterogeneity. The paper systematically reviews
recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, particularly its practical
applications in complex agricultural environments. We examine the key drivers
for adopting DA in agriculture, such as limited labeled data, weak model
transferability, and dynamic environmental conditions. We also discuss its use
in crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, highlighting
improvements in performance across regions and seasons. The paper categorizes
DA methods into shallow and deep learning models, with further divisions into
supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. A special focus is
given to adversarial learning-based DA methods, which have shown great promise
in challenging agricultural scenarios. Finally, we review key public datasets
in agricultural imagery, analyzing their value and limitations in DA research.
This review provides a comprehensive framework for researchers, offering
insights into current research gaps and supporting the advancement of DA
methods in agricultural image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了MCA-Bench，一个多模态CAPTCHA基准测试套件，用于评估不同CAPTCHA类型的安全性，并揭示了挑战复杂性、交互深度和模型可解性之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAPTCHA方案缺乏统一的、大规模的、多模态的基准测试，无法全面评估其安全鲁棒性。

Method: 通过共享的视觉-语言模型骨干，为每种CAPTCHA类别微调专门的破解代理，实现跨模态评估。

Result: 实验表明MCA-Bench能有效映射现代CAPTCHA设计的漏洞谱，并首次定量分析了挑战复杂性、交互深度和模型可解性的关系。

Conclusion: 论文提出了三项可操作的设计原则，并指出关键开放挑战，为CAPTCHA加固、公平基准测试和社区合作奠定了基础。

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical
defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes
encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and
obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based
questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal
benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this
gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking
suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation
protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune
specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent,
cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench
effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under
varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of
how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate.
Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and
identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA
hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and
code are available online.

Motivation: 探讨视觉与语言基础模型在语言表达动作时是否具备现实世界模型和动态模型的能力，并解决开源模型在这方面的不足。

Method: 通过监督学习训练动态模型，并利用两种策略（弱监督学习和推理时验证）引导世界模型的训练。

Result: 最佳模型在Aurora-Bench上的动作中心图像编辑任务中表现优异，优于现有方法15%，并在人类评估中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 动态模型可以有效地引导世界模型的训练，提升模型在现实任务中的表现。

Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic
world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a
dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when
actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models
struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model
through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In
turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main
strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference
time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for
unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We
further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are
weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly,
the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model
to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the
world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric
image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance
competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a
margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and
achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

Abstract: Orthopoxvirus infections must be accurately classified from medical pictures
for an easy and early diagnosis and epidemic prevention. The necessity for
automated and scalable solutions is highlighted by the fact that traditional
diagnostic techniques can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation
and there are few and biased data sets of the different types of Orthopox. In
order to improve classification performance and lower computational costs, a
hybrid strategy is put forth in this paper that uses Machine Learning models
combined with pretrained Deep Learning models to extract deep feature
representations without the need for augmented data. The findings show that
this feature extraction method, when paired with other methods in the
state-of-the-art, produces excellent classification outcomes while preserving
training and inference efficiency. The proposed approach demonstrates strong
generalization and robustness across multiple evaluation settings, offering a
scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical deployment.

Abstract: Stereo video generation has been gaining increasing attention with recent
advancements in video diffusion models. However, most existing methods focus on
generating 3D stereoscopic videos from monocular 2D videos. These approaches
typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the
task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while
preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that
not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and
right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this
by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as
conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a
result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo
video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both
stereo video generation and restoration. Experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively in
stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs.

Motivation: 现有扩散净化方法对所有样本使用固定噪声水平，而研究发现不同样本可能需要不同的噪声水平，因此提出动态调整噪声水平的框架。

Method: SSNI利用预训练的评分网络估计样本偏离干净数据分布的程度（评分范数），并通过重加权函数自适应调整每个样本的噪声水平。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K数据集上，SSNI显著提升了现有扩散净化方法的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在扩散净化方法中为不同样本分配不同的噪声水平是必要的，SSNI框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise
from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward
diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse
generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected
to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled
by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this
paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be
different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should
be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).
Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data
point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,
based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to
adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise
injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods
results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels
to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at:

neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in
decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in
accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from
their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and
multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1)
The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior,
capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to
CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These
complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the
final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information
from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions
describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images
synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that
HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic
information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FIS的新型张量处理层，其计算成本与输入大小成线性关系，适用于图像和高阶张量数据。通过实验验证，FIS层在分类和异常检测任务中表现优异，且能显著减少参数和计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习应用中，图像和高阶张量数据的高维度特性使得开发计算效率高的处理层变得尤为重要。论文旨在设计一种线性成本的张量处理层，以解决传统方法的计算瓶颈。

Method: 利用数学工具“角树”和多重参数化的迭代积分（或求和）签名，提出了一种名为FIS的张量处理层。该层可无缝集成到现有神经网络中，并支持图像处理任务。

Result: 在分类任务中，FIS层替换部分ResNet层后，性能接近更大的ResNet模型（准确率差异仅0.1%），同时减少了可训练参数和计算量。在异常检测任务中，FIS模型在MVTec AD数据集上平均AUROC达到97.3%。

Conclusion: FIS层是一种高效且通用的张量处理工具，适用于多种深度学习任务，能够显著提升计算效率而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern
deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the
need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than
for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost
in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from
the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we
provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing
pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a
multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums).
The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer
called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with
other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both
classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a
smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of
only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also
used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of
97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing
and modelling codes are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种浅层-深层协同检测网络（SDS-Net），通过双分支架构和自适应特征融合模块，提升红外小目标检测的精度和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN方法忽视浅层与深层特征的异质性，导致特征协作不足，影响检测性能和计算效率。

Method: 采用双分支架构分别建模结构特征和语义特征，引入自适应特征融合模块动态建模跨层特征相关性。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时保持低计算复杂度和高推理效率。

Conclusion: SDS-Net在红外小目标检测中表现出优越性能，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally
overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to
inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information
and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency
relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack
systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of
multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring
substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that
efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the
detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net
introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural
characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving
shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby
achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed.
Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to
dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature
collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three
public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational
complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection
performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大规模预训练的视觉语言模型（VLM）在医学图像分析中的可靠性，提出了一种新的全适应性共形预测框架（full conformal adaptation）和SS-Text方法，以提高模型的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在医学图像分析中展现出强大的判别能力，但其可靠性尚未得到充分研究。特别是在零样本性能有限的情况下，传统的共形预测框架（SCP）难以适应少样本迁移学习的需求。

Method: 论文提出了一种全适应性共形预测框架，通过在每个测试数据点上进行转导性调整，并结合SS-Text（一种无需训练的新型线性探针求解器），以降低计算成本。

Result: 实验使用了3种不同模态的医学VLM和9个适应任务，结果显示该框架在保持相同覆盖率的同时，相对效率提升了高达27%。

Conclusion: 该研究为预训练基础模型的适应性和共形化提供了新方法，显著提升了医学图像分析中模型的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained at large scale have shown
unprecedented transferability capabilities and are being progressively
integrated into medical image analysis. Although its discriminative potential
has been widely explored, its reliability aspect remains overlooked. This work
investigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal
prediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level
on output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot
performance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves
few-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid
exchangeability assumptions of SCP. To alleviate this issue, we propose full
conformal adaptation, a novel setting for jointly adapting and conformalizing
pre-trained foundation models, which operates transductively over each test
data point using a few-shot adaptation set. Moreover, we complement this
framework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that
alleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide
comprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs
and 9 adaptation tasks. Our framework requires exactly the same data as SCP,
and provides consistent relative improvements of up to 27% on set efficiency
while maintaining the same coverage guarantees.

TL;DR: WisWheat是一个专为小麦管理任务设计的三层数据集，通过微调开源视觉语言模型（VLMs），显著提升了小麦病害诊断和生长阶段管理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统小麦管理依赖人工专家检查，成本高且难以扩展。现有VLMs因缺乏领域知识，在小麦管理任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出WisWheat数据集，包括预训练层、定量层和指令微调层，用于增强VLMs的小麦管理能力。

Result: 微调后的Qwen2.5 VL 7B在小麦病害和生长阶段任务中分别达到79.2%和84.6%的准确率，优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: WisWheat数据集有效提升了VLMs在小麦管理任务中的性能，为农业智能化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Wheat management strategies play a critical role in determining yield.
Traditional management decisions often rely on labour-intensive expert
inspections, which are expensive, subjective and difficult to scale. Recently,
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to enable
scalable, data-driven management support. However, due to a lack of
domain-specific knowledge, directly applying VLMs to wheat management tasks
results in poor quantification and reasoning capabilities, ultimately producing
vague or even misleading management recommendations. In response, we propose
WisWheat, a wheat-specific dataset with a three-layered design to enhance VLM
performance on wheat management tasks: (1) a foundational pretraining dataset
of 47,871 image-caption pairs for coarsely adapting VLMs to wheat morphology;
(2) a quantitative dataset comprising 7,263 VQA-style image-question-answer
triplets for quantitative trait measuring tasks; and (3) an Instruction
Fine-tuning dataset with 4,888 samples targeting biotic and abiotic stress
diagnosis and management plan for different phenological stages. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g.,
Qwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements.
Specifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset
achieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage
conversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial
models such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.

TL;DR: FBG（FeedBack Guidance）通过动态调整引导量，解决了CFG（Classifier-Free Guidance）在条件扩散模型中可能损害多样性和导致记忆化的问题。FBG基于条件分布被无条件分布线性污染的假设，通过反馈预测自适应调整引导量，显著优于CFG，并在ImageNet512x512和文本到图像生成中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG在条件扩散模型中虽然能提高样本保真度，但固定引导量可能导致多样性损失和记忆化问题。FBG旨在通过动态调整引导量解决这一问题。

Method: FBG基于条件分布被无条件分布线性污染的假设，通过反馈预测自适应调整引导量，动态适应不同样本的需求。

Result: 在ImageNet512x512上，FBG显著优于CFG，并与LIG（Limited Interval Guidance）竞争。在文本到图像生成中，FBG能自动为复杂提示应用更高引导量。

Conclusion: FBG提供了一种动态调整引导量的方法，优于固定引导量的CFG，并能与其他引导方案结合，具有更强的数学框架和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become standard for improving sample
fidelity in conditional diffusion models, it can harm diversity and induce
memorization by applying constant guidance regardless of whether a particular
sample needs correction. We propose FeedBack Guidance (FBG), which uses a
state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance amounts based on need.
Our approach is derived from first principles by assuming the learned
conditional distribution is linearly corrupted by the unconditional
distribution, contrasting with CFG's implicit multiplicative assumption. Our
scheme relies on feedback of its own predictions about the conditional signal
informativeness to adapt guidance dynamically during inference, challenging the
view of guidance as a fixed hyperparameter. The approach is benchmarked on
ImageNet512x512, where it significantly outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance
and is competitive to Limited Interval Guidance (LIG) while benefitting from a
strong mathematical framework. On Text-To-Image generation, we demonstrate
that, as anticipated, our approach automatically applies higher guidance scales
for complex prompts than for simpler ones and that it can be easily combined
with existing guidance schemes such as CFG or LIG.

TL;DR: CLaMR是一种多模态视频内容检索系统，通过动态选择最佳模态组合提升检索效果，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频内容多模态特性导致传统独立检索方法效果不佳，需动态选择最佳模态组合。

Method: 提出CLaMR，联合编码视频帧、语音、文本和元数据，并引入MultiVENT 2.0++数据集和模态感知损失训练。

Result: 在MultiVENT 2.0++和MSRVTT测试集上，CLaMR显著优于单模态和多模态基线方法，nDCG@10提升25.6和35.4。

Conclusion: CLaMR通过动态模态选择和联合训练，在多模态视频检索中表现优异，下游任务如长视频QA也有显著提升。

Abstract: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision,
speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat
these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and
subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where
relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple
modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must
dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the
query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that
jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,
and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal
backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic
modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training
data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale
synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in
various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we
propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard
contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality
usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation
strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade
performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR
consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR
improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4
over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream
utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50%
boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on
LongVideoBench.

TL;DR: VideoChat-A1是一种新型长视频代理范式，通过链式镜头推理逐步选择相关镜头，模仿人类思考过程，显著提升长视频理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs擅长分析短视频，但在长视频理解上表现不佳，尤其是忽略多镜头结构，导致冗余或噪声上下文。

Method: 提出VideoChat-A1，采用链式镜头推理范式，逐步选择相关镜头并进行多模态推理。

Result: 在主流长视频QA基准测试中表现最优，如VideoMME（77.0）和EgoSchema（70.1），显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VideoChat-A1通过模仿人类思考过程，高效理解长视频，性能优于现有方法，且计算资源消耗更低。

Abstract: The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos,
while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer
context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been
proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a
long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video
is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long
video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.
Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy
temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To
fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm.
Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long
videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it
can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into
these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the
shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking
process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for
thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our
VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long
video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema,
outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and
InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with
7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.

Motivation: 传统相机在极低光条件下动态范围有限，导致图像细节丢失和运动模糊，现有事件相机方法忽略了全局低频噪声和稀疏事件数据的局部结构不连续性问题。

Method: 提出BiLIE框架，包括事件特征增强（EFE）模块和双向交叉注意力融合（BCAF）机制，分别解决低频噪声和结构不连续性问题。

Result: 实验表明，BiLIE在PSNR和LPIPS指标上分别优于现有方法0.96dB和0.03。

Conclusion: BiLIE有效提升了低光图像增强性能，并通过新数据集RELIE提供了更可靠的评估基准。

Abstract: Under extreme low-light conditions, traditional frame-based cameras, due to
their limited dynamic range and temporal resolution, face detail loss and
motion blur in captured images. To overcome this bottleneck, researchers have
introduced event cameras and proposed event-guided low-light image enhancement
algorithms. However, these methods neglect the influence of global
low-frequency noise caused by dynamic lighting conditions and local structural
discontinuities in sparse event data. To address these issues, we propose an
innovative Bidirectional guided Low-light Image Enhancement framework (BiLIE).
Specifically, to mitigate the significant low-frequency noise introduced by
global illumination step changes, we introduce the frequency high-pass
filtering-based Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) module at the event
representation level to suppress the interference of low-frequency information,
and preserve and highlight the high-frequency edges.Furthermore, we design a
Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) mechanism to acquire high-frequency
structures and edges while suppressing structural discontinuities and local
noise introduced by sparse event guidance, thereby generating smoother fused
representations.Additionally, considering the poor visual quality and color
bias in existing datasets, we provide a new dataset (RELIE), with high-quality
ground truth through a reliable enhancement scheme. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed BiLIE outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.

Result: CCLSTM在占用流指标上达到最先进性能，并在2024 Waymo挑战赛所有指标中排名第一。

Conclusion: CCLSTM是一种高效且实用的解决方案，适用于自动驾驶中的未来状态预测任务。

Abstract: Predicting future states of dynamic agents is a fundamental task in
autonomous driving. An expressive representation for this purpose is Occupancy
Flow Fields, which provide a scalable and unified format for modeling motion,
spatial extent, and multi-modal future distributions. While recent methods have
achieved strong results using this representation, they often depend on
high-quality vectorized inputs, which are unavailable or difficult to generate
in practice, and the use of transformer-based architectures, which are
computationally intensive and costly to deploy. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM)}, a lightweight, end-to-end
trainable architecture based solely on convolutional operations. Without
relying on vectorized inputs or self-attention mechanisms, CCLSTM effectively
captures temporal dynamics and spatial occupancy-flow correlations using a
compact recurrent convolutional structure. Despite its simplicity, CCLSTM
achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and, as of this
submission, ranks \(1^{\text{st}}\) in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy

Method: 构建了H2Crop数据集，结合EnMAP高光谱数据和Sentinel-2时间序列，提出双流Transformer架构，分别处理光谱-空间和时间特征，并通过层次分类头实现多级分类。

Result: 实验表明，加入高光谱数据使F1分数平均提升4.2%，峰值达6.3%，且优于现有深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 高光谱数据在多时相窗口和作物变化场景中具有一致优势，H2Crop数据集和方法为细粒度作物分类提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and
food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological
dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and
subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from
hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce
currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types
annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical
hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP
hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated
field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a
vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and
hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer
architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates
two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained
signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer
extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed
hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously
delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments
demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series
yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive
comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep
learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of
hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

Method: MF$^2$包含50多部开放许可的全长电影，每部电影配对手工构建的真实和虚假声明对，共850多对，评估模型对核心叙事元素的识别能力。

Result: 实验表明，当前最先进的模型在识别真实和虚假声明对的任务上远低于人类表现。

Conclusion: MF$^2$揭示了当前VLMs在长视频叙事理解上的不足，突出了人类在关键信息保留和推理上的优势。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic
understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,
partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,
``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval
over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically
generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are
easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this
paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can
comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length
movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,
open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs
-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.
These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and
emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that
humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice
formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models
must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases
like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our
experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art
models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of
the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over
critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

Abstract: In this report, we address the task of online mistake detection, which is
vital in domains like industrial automation and education, where real-time
video analysis allows human operators to correct errors as they occur. While
previous work focuses on procedural errors involving action order, broader
error types must be addressed for real-world use. We introduce an online

(e.g., motor slips or tool misuse). Upon detecting an error, we use a large

HoloAssist benchmark confirm the effectiveness of our approach, where our
approach is placed second on the mistake detection task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统经验指数或黑盒学习模型在多光谱数据的高维复杂性中表现不佳，需要一种既能保持准确性又具有物理可解释性的方法。

Method: 结合Vision Transformer编码器进行空间-光谱特征提取，并通过物理引导约束确保一致性和可解释性。

Result: 在基准数据集和遥感任务中表现出优越的性能、稳定性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SatelliteFormula填补了数据驱动学习与物理理解之间的鸿沟，实现了复杂环境变量的可解释建模。

Abstract: We propose SatelliteFormula, a novel symbolic regression framework that
derives physically interpretable expressions directly from multi-spectral
remote sensing imagery. Unlike traditional empirical indices or black-box
learning models, SatelliteFormula combines a Vision Transformer-based encoder
for spatial-spectral feature extraction with physics-guided constraints to
ensure consistency and interpretability. Existing symbolic regression methods
struggle with the high-dimensional complexity of multi-spectral data; our
method addresses this by integrating transformer representations into a
symbolic optimizer that balances accuracy and physical plausibility. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets and remote sensing tasks demonstrate superior
performance, stability, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. SatelliteFormula enables interpretable modeling of complex
environmental variables, bridging the gap between data-driven learning and
physical understanding.

*Christian Fruhwirth-Reisinger,Dušan Malić,Wei Lin,David Schinagl,Samuel Schulter,Horst Possegger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STSBench是一个基于场景的框架，用于评估自动驾驶中视觉语言模型（VLMs）的全面理解能力，特别关注时空推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准通常针对单一视角的图像或视频，且侧重于语义任务，而STSBench填补了多视角、时空推理评估的空白，为自动驾驶VLMs提供更全面的测试。

Method: 框架通过真实标注自动挖掘交通场景，提供用户界面进行人工验证，并生成多选题用于模型评估。应用在NuScenes数据集上，创建了STSnu基准。

Result: STSnu包含43个场景和971个多选题，揭示了现有模型在复杂交通动态推理上的不足。

Conclusion: STSBench为开发更鲁棒和可解释的自动驾驶VLMs提供了关键工具，凸显了时空推理建模的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic
understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The
framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset
using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for
efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model
evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first
benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs
based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target
off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint
and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk
assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert
VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or
LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle
actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial
capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios
spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified
multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings
in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in
complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for
architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By
addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the
development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.

*Diji Yang,Minghao Liu,Chung-Hsiang Lo,Yi Zhang,James Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GenIR的生成式多轮检索方法，用于解决用户通过多轮交互搜索脑海中的图像（Mental Image Retrieval, MIR）的问题。该方法利用扩散模型生成可视化反馈，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在文本到图像检索中表现良好，但实际应用中用户的搜索行为通常是多轮交互的，且现有方法依赖间接或抽象的反馈，效果不佳。

Method: 提出GenIR，一种基于扩散模型的生成式多轮检索方法，通过生成可视化反馈帮助用户直观地优化查询。

Result: 实验表明，GenIR在多轮MIR场景中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为MIR任务提供了新的数据集和方法，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image
retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications
remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot
action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,
that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental
representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task
of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored
setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through
multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful
interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with
clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or
abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective
for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative
multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to
explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic
visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to
refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully
automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing
interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with
a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation
for future research in this direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算机视觉模型在内窥镜领域泛化能力不足，而基础模型显示出跨领域潜力，因此研究VLMs在内窥镜手术任务中的能力。

Method: 使用多种最先进的VLMs、多个手术数据集和大量人工标注，评估VLMs在基础感知任务和高级场景理解任务中的表现，并比较专业医疗VLMs与通用模型的性能。

Result: VLMs在基础手术感知任务（如目标计数和定位）上表现良好，但在需要医学知识的任务上表现显著下降。专业医疗VLMs表现不及通用模型。

Conclusion: VLMs在内窥镜手术任务中仍有改进空间，尤其是针对医学知识的优化。研究为下一代内窥镜AI系统开发提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to
generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown
promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first
large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs)
for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a
diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and
extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions:
(1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can
they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3)
How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context?
Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception
tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels
comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates
significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that
specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models
across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet
optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight
the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique
challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for
the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key
areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于标准PyTorch数据加载器无法在从云存储直接流式传输GeoTIFF文件时充分利用现代GPU，研究旨在解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 通过系统测试不同加载配置和数据参数，重点关注瓦片对齐读取和线程池，使用贝叶斯优化为每种存储类型找到最佳设置。

Result: 优化配置使远程数据加载吞吐量提升20倍，本地提升4倍；在相同时间预算下，远程加载训练的模型达到与本地训练相同的精度，验证IoU提升6-15%，GPU利用率达85-95%。

Conclusion: 优化后的数据加载配置显著提升了训练效率和模型性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Training deep learning models on petabyte-scale Earth observation (EO) data
requires separating compute resources from data storage. However, standard
PyTorch data loaders cannot keep modern GPUs utilized when streaming GeoTIFF
files directly from cloud storage. In this work, we benchmark GeoTIFF loading
throughput from both cloud object storage and local SSD, systematically testing
different loader configurations and data parameters. We focus on tile-aligned
reads and worker thread pools, using Bayesian optimization to find optimal
settings for each storage type. Our optimized configurations increase remote
data loading throughput by 20x and local throughput by 4x compared to default
settings. On three public EO benchmarks, models trained with optimized remote
loading achieve the same accuracy as local training within identical time
budgets. We improve validation IoU by 6-15% and maintain 85-95% GPU utilization
versus 0-30% with standard configurations. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Visual Graph Arena（VGA）数据集，用于评估和改进AI系统在视觉抽象能力上的表现，揭示当前模型在概念化推理上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在视觉问答中取得突破，但在概念化推理（即识别和推理视觉形式变化下的同一概念）方面仍存在不足，这是人类推理的基本能力。

Method: 通过VGA数据集，设计了六种基于图的任务，使用多样化的图布局（如Kamada-Kawai与平面图）来测试模型对视觉形式无关的推理能力。

Result: 实验显示，人类在任务中接近完美准确率，而模型在异构检测上完全失败，在路径/循环任务中表现有限，表明模型仅进行伪智能模式匹配。

Conclusion: VGA为AI视觉模型提供了一个框架，推动其实现类人概念化推理的进步，同时揭示了当前模型的根本局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven
breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists,
`conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept
despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset
featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems'
capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g.,
Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form.
Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a
striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while
models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in
path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting
pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These
findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual
understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant
reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like
conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at:

Abstract: Perceiving the world from both egocentric (first-person) and exocentric
(third-person) perspectives is fundamental to human cognition, enabling rich
and complementary understanding of dynamic environments. In recent years,
allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual
perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video
understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video
understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by
highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and
exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across
domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications.
Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main
research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric
understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis,
and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each
direction, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally,
we discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives,
evaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss
limitations in current works and propose promising future research directions.
By synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire
advancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing
machines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner. A GitHub repo

Method: 提出低成本光照舞台捕获设置，收集多视角数据集；基于3D高斯基元和参数化头部模型构建化身；结合神经漫反射BRDF和解析高光项的混合着色方法。

Result: 在实验中显著优于现有方法，实现了高质量的重光照和动画控制。

Conclusion: BecomingLit为可重光照和动画化的头部化身提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce BecomingLit, a novel method for reconstructing relightable,
high-resolution head avatars that can be rendered from novel viewpoints at
interactive rates. Therefore, we propose a new low-cost light stage capture
setup, tailored specifically towards capturing faces. Using this setup, we
collect a novel dataset consisting of diverse multi-view sequences of numerous
subjects under varying illumination conditions and facial expressions. By
leveraging our new dataset, we introduce a new relightable avatar
representation based on 3D Gaussian primitives that we animate with a
parametric head model and an expression-dependent dynamics module. We propose a
new hybrid neural shading approach, combining a neural diffuse BRDF with an
analytical specular term. Our method reconstructs disentangled materials from
our dynamic light stage recordings and enables all-frequency relighting of our
avatars with both point lights and environment maps. In addition, our avatars
can easily be animated and controlled from monocular videos. We validate our
approach in extensive experiments on our dataset, where we consistently
outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in relighting and reenactment by a
significant margin.

Motivation: 解决高分辨率图像合成中归一化流的可扩展性和性能问题，同时保持端到端的最大似然训练。

Method: 提出Transformer自回归流（TARFlow），结合深度-浅层设计、潜在空间建模和新型引导算法，提升模型表现。

Result: 在类别条件和文本条件图像生成任务中表现优异，接近扩散模型的样本质量。

Conclusion: STARFlow首次证明了归一化流在大规模和分辨率下的有效性，为生成模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows
that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core
of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

in 6 domains: Sports, Bike Repair, Cooking, Health, Music, and Dance. ExAct
requires the correct answer to be selected from five carefully designed

Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）继承了大型语言模型（LLM）的架构设计，导致多模态处理中存在视觉信息忽视和2D结构关系丢失的问题。

Method: 提出CoMemo，采用双路径架构（Context图像路径和图像Memory路径）和RoPE-DHR位置编码机制，通过缩略图位置聚合保持2D空间感知。

Conclusion: CoMemo通过改进架构和位置编码机制，有效解决了LVLM中的视觉信息处理问题，为多模态任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models built upon Large Language
Models have established aligning visual features with LLM representations as
the dominant paradigm. However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce
suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a
bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive
neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional
positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships
when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations,
we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path
with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual
information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional
encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to
maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended
sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context
comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering,
demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM
architectures. Project page is available at

Abstract: Modern Earth observation (EO) increasingly leverages deep learning to harness
the scale and diversity of satellite imagery across sensors and regions. While
recent foundation models have demonstrated promising generalization across EO
tasks, many remain limited by the scale, geographical coverage, and spectral
diversity of their training data, factors critical for learning globally
transferable representations. In this work, we introduce TerraFM, a scalable
self-supervised learning model that leverages globally distributed Sentinel-1
and Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with large spatial tiles and land-cover aware
sampling to enrich spatial and semantic coverage. By treating sensing
modalities as natural augmentations in our self-supervised approach, we unify
radar and optical inputs via modality-specific patch embeddings and adaptive
cross-attention fusion. Our training strategy integrates local-global
contrastive learning and introduces a dual-centering mechanism that
incorporates class-frequency-aware regularization to address long-tailed
distributions in land cover.TerraFM achieves strong generalization on both
classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench
and Copernicus-Bench. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

Motivation: 随着推理扩展到多节点部署，分布式推理为提高吞吐量和交互性提供了潜力，但实际部署仍受限于优化搜索空间的复杂性和系统级协调。

Method: 通过评估数十万个设计点，涵盖多样化的工作负载和硬件配置，对分布式推理进行了系统性研究。

Abstract: As inference scales to multi-node deployments, disaggregation - splitting
inference into distinct phases - offers a promising path to improving the
throughput-interactivity Pareto frontier. Despite growing enthusiasm and a
surge of open-source efforts, practical deployment of disaggregated serving
remains limited due to the complexity of the optimization search space and
system-level coordination. In this paper, we present the first systematic study
of disaggregated inference at scale, evaluating hundreds of thousands of design
points across diverse workloads and hardware configurations. We find that
disaggregation is most effective for prefill-heavy traffic patterns and larger
models. Our results highlight the critical role of dynamic rate matching and
elastic scaling in achieving Pareto-optimal performance. Our findings offer
actionable insights for efficient disaggregated deployments to navigate the
trade-off between system throughput and interactivity.

Motivation: 传统 HPA 无法应对故障、网络攻击等资源中断问题，导致资源浪费和服务不可用。SecureSmart HPA 旨在解决这些问题，提升自动扩展的韧性和效率。

Method: SecureSmart HPA 监控微服务资源需求，检测中断，评估资源浪费，并动态调整扩展决策。同时支持微服务间的资源共享，优化资源受限环境下的扩展效率。

Result: 实验表明，SecureSmart HPA 在不同中断严重程度下表现良好，CPU 过载减少 57.2%，资源分配提升 51.1%。

Conclusion: SecureSmart HPA 在资源受限和波动环境中提供了高效且韧性的自动扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Horizontal Pod Auto-scalers (HPAs) are crucial for managing resource
allocation in microservice architectures to handle fluctuating workloads.
However, traditional HPAs fail to address resource disruptions caused by
faults, cyberattacks, maintenance, and other operational challenges. These
disruptions result in resource wastage, service unavailability, and HPA
performance degradation. To address these challenges, we extend our prior work
on Smart HPA and propose SecureSmart HPA, which offers resilient and
resource-efficient auto-scaling for microservice architectures. SecureSmart HPA
monitors microservice resource demands, detects disruptions, evaluates resource
wastage, and dynamically adjusts scaling decisions to enhance the resilience of
auto-scaling operations. Furthermore, SecureSmart HPA enables resource sharing
among microservices, optimizing scaling efficiency in resource-constrained
environments. Experimental evaluation at varying disruption severities, with
25%, 50%, and 75% resource wastage, demonstrates that SecureSmart HPA performs
effectively across different levels of disruptions. It achieves up to a 57.2%
reduction in CPU overutilization and a 51.1% increase in resource allocation
compared to Smart HPA, highlighting its ability to deliver resilient and
efficient auto-scaling operations in volatile and resource-constrained
environments.

Abstract: Wireless communication provides great advantages that are not available
through their wired counterparts such as flexibility, ease of deployment and
use, cost reductions, and convenience. Wireless multi-hop networks (WMN) do not
have any centralized management infrastructure. Wireless multi-hop networks
have many benefits since proposed. In such networks when a node wants to send a
packet to a destination where is not in the transmission range, depend on some
intermediate nodes. In this type of networks packet sending is in the form of
multiple hop until destination and this work is dynamic. Lack of centralized
management cause that some nodes show malicious function. Malicious nodes are
that receive packets and drop them maliciously. These malicious nodes could
have many reasons such as hardware failure, software failure or lack of power.
Such nodes make multiple packets drop from the network and the performance of
network strongly decreases. As a result, the throughput of the network
decrease, increase end-to-end delay and increase overhead. Therefore, we must
aware from presence of malicious node in the network and do routing based on
this awareness. Therefore, this paper aims to study and review the present
malicious node detection methods that proposed in literatures. We categorized
networks in groups, including ad hoc networks, MANET, DTN, Opportunistic
networks, WSN, VANET and other wireless networks and compare malicious node
detection met

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文研究了在同步分布式网络中计算完美匹配的问题，重点分析了通信限制下的算法性能，比较了随机与确定性算法的差异，并展示了在KT_1假设下的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索在通信受限的分布式网络中高效计算完美匹配的方法，尤其是在仅能发送脉冲的通信模式下，如何优化算法的性能。

Method: 采用随机算法和确定性算法，分别在端口编号模型和KT_1假设下设计解决方案，分析其时间复杂度和脉冲复杂度。

Result: 随机算法在端口编号模型下达到O(log n)轮和O(n log n)脉冲复杂度；确定性算法在KT_1假设下显著改进为O(log n)时间和O(n)脉冲复杂度，并进一步优化为O(log* n log log n)时间。

Conclusion: 论文表明，在通信受限的分布式网络中，随机算法和额外知识（如KT_1假设）可以显著提升完美匹配问题的解决效率。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing a perfect matching problem in a
synchronous distributed network, where the network topology corresponds to a
complete bipartite graph. The communication between nodes is restricted to
activating communication links, which means that instead of sending messages
containing a number of bits, each node can only send a pulse over some of its
incident links in each round. In the port numbering model, where nodes are
unaware of their neighbor's IDs, we give a randomized algorithm that terminates
in $O( \log n )$ rounds and has a pulse complexity of $O( n\log n )$, which
corresponds to the number of pulses sent over all links. We also show that
randomness is crucial in the port numbering model, as any deterministic
algorithm must send at least $\Omega( n^2 )$ messages in the standard LOCAL
model, where the messages can be of unbounded size. Then, we turn our attention
to the KT_1 assumption, where each node starts out knowing its neighbors' IDs.
We show that this additional knowledge enables significantly improved bounds
even for deterministic algorithms. First, we give an $O( \log n )$ time
deterministic algorithm that sends only $O( n )$ pulses. Finally, we apply this
algorithm recursively to obtain an exponential reduction in the time complexity
to $O( \log^*n\log\log n )$, while slightly increasing the pulse complexity to
$O( n\log^*n )$. All our bounds also hold in the standard CONGEST model with
single-bit messages.

### [194] [ScaleRTL: Scaling LLMs with Reasoning Data and Test-Time Compute for Accurate RTL Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05566)
*Chenhui Deng,Yun-Da Tsai,Guan-Ting Liu,Zhongzhi Yu,Haoxing Ren*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: ScaleRTL是一种针对RTL代码生成的首个推理型LLM，通过高质量推理数据和测试时计算扩展，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在RTL代码生成中因高质量训练数据稀缺和缺乏推理能力而受限。

Method: 通过构建包含3.5B令牌的多样化推理数据集，并采用测试时扩展策略（自我反思和修正）优化模型。

Result: 在VerilogEval和RTLLM上表现最优，分别超出基线18.4%和12.7%。

Conclusion: ScaleRTL通过数据扩展和推理优化，显著提升了RTL代码生成的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled near-human
performance on software coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness in RTL code
generation remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality training data.
While prior efforts have fine-tuned LLMs for RTL tasks, they do not
fundamentally overcome the data bottleneck and lack support for test-time
scaling due to their non-reasoning nature. In this work, we introduce ScaleRTL,
the first reasoning LLM for RTL coding that scales up both high-quality
reasoning data and test-time compute. Specifically, we curate a diverse set of
long chain-of-thought reasoning traces averaging 56K tokens each, resulting in
a dataset of 3.5B tokens that captures rich RTL knowledge. Fine-tuning a
general-purpose reasoning model on this corpus yields ScaleRTL that is capable
of deep RTL reasoning. Subsequently, we further enhance the performance of
ScaleRTL through a novel test-time scaling strategy that extends the reasoning
process via iteratively reflecting on and self-correcting previous reasoning
steps. Experimental results show that ScaleRTL achieves state-of-the-art
performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, outperforming 18 competitive baselines by
up to 18.4% on VerilogEval and 12.7% on RTLLM.

TL;DR: Lumina是一个硬件-算法协同设计的系统，通过S^2算法和辐射缓存机制优化3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的神经渲染效率，显著提升速度和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在移动SoC上计算需求高，需优化以提升效率和性能。

Method: 提出S^2算法利用时间相干性减少计算开销，RC机制降低光栅化计算频率，并设计LuminCore加速器优化缓存查找。

Result: 相比移动Volta GPU，速度提升4.5倍，能耗降低5.3倍，质量损失极小（<0.2 dB PSNR）。

Conclusion: Lumina通过协同优化显著提升了3DGS的效率和性能，适用于移动设备。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has vastly advanced the pace of neural
rendering, but it remains computationally demanding on today's mobile SoCs. To
address this challenge, we propose Lumina, a hardware-algorithm co-designed
system, which integrates two principal optimizations: a novel algorithm, S^2,
and a radiance caching mechanism, RC, to improve the efficiency of neural
rendering. S2 algorithm exploits temporal coherence in rendering to reduce the
computational overhead, while RC leverages the color integration process of
3DGS to decrease the frequency of intensive rasterization computations. Coupled
with these techniques, we propose an accelerator architecture, LuminCore, to
further accelerate cache lookup and address the fundamental inefficiencies in
Rasterization. We show that Lumina achieves 4.5x speedup and 5.3x energy
reduction against a mobile Volta GPU, with a marginal quality loss (< 0.2 dB
peak signal-to-noise ratio reduction) across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 研究如何通过观察少量像素预测图像未观察部分，以提升自回归模型在图像数据分布学习中的性能。

Method: 提出了一种适用于实值和彩色图像的广义且计算高效的ConvNADE模型，并比较了随机像素块与低差异像素块对重建质量的影响。

Result: 实验表明，使用低差异序列选择的像素块能降低测试损失并生成更真实的图像。

Conclusion: 低差异像素块选择策略能显著提升图像重建质量，为自回归模型在图像处理中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data
by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of
one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on
preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in
which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this
paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels
(referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As
our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally
efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution
estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover,
we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random
pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo
theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels
akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more
realistic reconstructed images.

Abstract: Registration of histological and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) allows for
more precise identification of structural changes and chemical interactions in
tissue. With histology and MSI having entirely different image formation
processes and dimensionalities, registration of the two modalities remains an
ongoing challenge. This work proposes a solution that synthesises histological
images from MSI, using a pix2pix model, to effectively enable unimodal
registration. Preliminary results show promising synthetic histology images
with limited artifacts, achieving increases in mutual information (MI) and
structural similarity index measures (SSIM) of +0.924 and +0.419, respectively,
compared to a baseline U-Net model. Our source code is available on GitHub:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FPDANet的双边多尺度信息融合网络，用于解决胎儿超声图像分类中的低对比度、高相似性和高噪声问题。通过设计位置注意力机制（DAN）和双边多尺度（FPAN）模块，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ResNet在胎儿超声图像分类中存在特征单向传递和上下文信息关联不足的问题，而胎儿超声图像本身具有低对比度、高相似性和高噪声的挑战。

Method: 设计了位置注意力机制（DAN）模块和双边多尺度（FPAN）信息融合模块，以增强特征表示并捕获不同尺度的上下文和全局特征依赖。

Result: FPDANet在Top-1和Top-5指标上分别达到91.05%和100%的分类准确率。

Conclusion: FPDANet在胎儿超声图像分类任务中表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability
to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation.
However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and
lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not
effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task,
and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high
similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale
information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges.
Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which
utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different
spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In
addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to
capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales,
thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification
results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively,
and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of
FPDANet.

TL;DR: LinGuinE是一种自动化方法，用于分割肺部肿瘤的纵向CT扫描数据，显著提高了分割准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏自动化或半自动化的纵向肿瘤分割方法，而这对放疗、手术干预和化疗反应评估至关重要。

Method: LinGuinE通过刚性配准将初始肿瘤标记点传播到其他时间点，并利用点击有效性分类器选择有效点以生成新分割。

Result: 在两个测试数据集上，LinGuinE的Dice系数提高了20%以上（p<0.05），适用于任意起始时间点。

Conclusion: LinGuinE在纵向肿瘤分割中表现出色，为临床实践提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in
radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in
assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the
tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal
study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or
semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces
LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours.
A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the
tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside
this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.
A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;
these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We
test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung
tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE
improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63
longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting
point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields
the best results on both test datasets.

Motivation: 现有皮肤病数据集未能捕捉真实世界临床和人口复杂性，如区域疾病分布、肤色多样性和非西方人群的不足。

Method: 数据集包含5450多张图像，由认证皮肤科医生标注，采用Rook分类法。测试了多种模型架构（卷积模型、Transformer模型和概念瓶颈模型）。

Result: 建立了基线性能，探索了解剖和概念线索的整合，为未来可解释和临床现实的模型提供指导。

Conclusion: DermaCon-IN为皮肤病AI在真实场景中的发展提供了可扩展且具代表性的基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling
scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable
models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and
demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from
region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the
underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We
introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising
over 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient
clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified
dermatologists with over 240 distinct diagnoses, structured under a
hierarchical, etiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The
dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation
commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures
including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet),
transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to
establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level
cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts
toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a
scalable and representative foundation for advancing dermatology AI in
real-world settings.

Method: 本文比较了多种预处理方法对忆阻器RC系统的影响，并提出了一种新的基于奇偶校验的预处理方法。

Result: 提出的奇偶校验预处理方法将准确性提高了2-6%，同时设备数量仅小幅增加。

Conclusion: 研究强调了预处理策略对提升忆阻器RC系统效率和可扩展性的重要性。

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) has attracted attention as an efficient recurrent
neural network architecture due to its simplified training, requiring only its
last perceptron readout layer to be trained. When implemented with memristors,
RC systems benefit from their dynamic properties, which make them ideal for
reservoir construction. However, achieving high performance in memristor-based
RC remains challenging, as it critically depends on the input preprocessing
method and reservoir size. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive evaluation
that quantifies the impact of these factors is still lacking. This paper
systematically compares various preprocessing methods for memristive RC
systems, assessing their effects on accuracy and energy consumption. We also
propose a parity-based preprocessing method that improves accuracy by 2-6%
while requiring only a modest increase in device count compared to other
methods. Our findings highlight the importance of informed preprocessing
strategies to improve the efficiency and scalability of memristive RC systems.

Motivation: 脉冲神经网络（SNNs）因其类脑计算和高效能耗特性备受关注，但在图像分类和物体检测等任务中表现不及人工神经网络（ANNs），主要受限于其表达能力。

Method: 采用整数二进制泄漏积分发放（Integer Binary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire）和范围对齐策略，前者支持训练时的整数值激活并保持脉冲驱动动态，后者解决高整数值激活受限问题。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅显著提升了SNNs的性能，甚至在某些任务中匹配或超越ANNs，同时保持了高效能耗特性。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are noted for their brain-like computation and
energy efficiency, but their performance lags behind Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) in tasks like image classification and object detection due to the
limited representational capacity. To address this, we propose a novel spiking
neuron, Integer Binary-Range Alignment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire to
exponentially expand the information expression capacity of spiking neurons
with only a slight energy increase. This is achieved through Integer Binary
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire and range alignment strategy. The Integer Binary Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire allows integer value activation during training and
maintains spike-driven dynamics with binary conversion expands virtual
timesteps during inference. The range alignment strategy is designed to solve
the spike activation limitation problem where neurons fail to activate high
integer values. Experiments show our method outperforms previous SNNs,
achieving 74.19% accuracy on ImageNet and 66.2% mAP@50 and 49.1% mAP@50:95 on
COCO, surpassing previous bests with the same architecture by +3.45% and +1.6%

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中LLM微调时的隐私和计算资源问题，尤其是针对中小型组织的需求。

Method: 使用剪枝和全同态加密（FHE）处理LoRA参数，优化联邦算法以提升效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持隐私保护的同时优于现有方法，且计算和通信开销更低。

Conclusion: FedShield-LLM为资源受限的组织提供了一种高效、安全的LLM协作训练方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized framework for training and
fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging computational resources
across organizations while keeping sensitive data on local devices. It
addresses privacy and security concerns while navigating challenges associated
with the substantial computational demands of LLMs, which can be prohibitive
for small and medium-sized organizations. FL supports the development of
task-specific LLMs for cross-silo applications through fine-tuning but remains
vulnerable to inference attacks, such as membership inference and gradient
inversion, which threaten data privacy. Prior studies have utilized
Differential Privacy (DP) in LLM fine-tuning, which, despite being effective at
preserving privacy, can degrade model performance. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a novel method, FedShield-LLM, that uses pruning with
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) parameters,
enabling secure computations on encrypted model updates while mitigating the
attack surface by deactivating less important LoRA parameters. Furthermore,
optimized federated algorithms for cross-silo environments enhance scalability
and efficiency. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA
substantially reduce computational and communication overhead, making FL
feasible for resource-constrained clients. Experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing methods while maintaining robust privacy
protection, enabling organizations to collaboratively train secure and
efficient LLMs.

Conclusion: 需开发更实用的水印解决方案，以适应LLMs的部署需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
demonstrating impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, deploying
these models introduces critical risks related to intellectual property
violations and potential misuse, particularly as adversaries can imitate these
models to steal services or generate misleading outputs. We specifically focus
on model stealing attacks, as they are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and
pose a serious threat to their security, revenue, and ethical deployment. While
various watermarking techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, it
remains unclear how far the community and industry have progressed in
developing and deploying watermarks in LLMs.
  To bridge this gap, we aim to develop a comprehensive systematization for
watermarks in LLMs by 1) presenting a detailed taxonomy for watermarks in LLMs,
2) proposing a novel intellectual property classifier to explore the
effectiveness and impacts of watermarks on LLMs under both attack and
attack-free environments, 3) analyzing the limitations of existing watermarks
in LLMs, and 4) discussing practical challenges and potential future directions
for watermarks in LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we show that despite
promising research outcomes and significant attention from leading companies
and community to deploy watermarks, these techniques have yet to reach their
full potential in real-world applications due to their unfavorable impacts on
model utility of LLMs and downstream tasks. Our findings provide an insightful
understanding of watermarks in LLMs, highlighting the need for practical
watermarks solutions tailored to LLM deployment.

Motivation: 现有后门防御技术通常针对单模态模型，且需要调整参数或依赖训练时的监督知识，而现实场景中无法修改冻结的视觉编码器或核心LLM参数。

Method: 提出了Robust Instruction Tuning框架，仅微调适配器模块和文本嵌入层，结合输入多样性正则化和异常激活正则化。

Result: 在Flickr30k和MSCOCO数据集上对七种攻击的实验表明，攻击成功率降至接近零，训练成本增加不到15%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效防御后门攻击，同时保持模型性能，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated excellent
instruction-following capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to stealthy backdoor
attacks when finetuned using contaminated data. Existing backdoor defense
techniques are usually developed for single-modal visual or language models
under fully parameter-adjustable settings or rely on supervisory knowledge
during training. However, in real-world scenarios, defenders cannot modify
frozen visual encoders or core LLM parameters, nor possess prior knowledge of
unknown trigger patterns or target responses. Motivated by the empirical
finding that LVLMs readily overfit to fixed, unknown triggers, which can embed
malicious associations during adapter-level tuning, we aim to design a defense
that operates without access to core weights or attack priors. To this end, we
introduce a lightweight, certified-agnostic defense framework, Robust
Instruction Tuning, that finetunes only adapter modules and text embedding
layers under instruction tuning. Our method integrates two complementary
regularizations: (1) Input Diversity Regularization, which perturbs trigger
components across training samples to disrupt consistent spurious cues; and (2)
Anomalous Activation Regularization, which dynamically sparses adapter weights
exhibiting abnormally sharp activations linked to backdoor patterns. These
mechanisms jointly guide the model toward learning semantically grounded
representations rather than memorizing superficial trigger-response mappings.
  Extensive experiments against seven attacks on Flickr30k and MSCOCO
demonstrate that ours
  reduces their attack success rate to nearly zero, with an increase in
training cost of less than 15%.

TL;DR: QA-HFL是一个质量感知的层次化联邦学习框架，通过质量加权融合和差分隐私保护，高效处理资源受限移动设备上的图像质量异构问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决移动设备图像质量异构和资源受限问题，同时确保隐私保护。

Method: 训练针对不同图像质量级别的本地模型，采用质量加权融合机制，并结合差分隐私保护。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上，QA-HFL在三轮联邦学习后达到92.31%准确率，优于FedRolex（86.42%）；在严格隐私约束下保持30.77%准确率。低端设备贡献最大（63.5%）。

Conclusion: QA-HFL通过设备特定正则化、自适应加权和智能客户端选择，显著提升性能，同时保持高效通信和隐私保护。

Abstract: This paper introduces QA-HFL, a quality-aware hierarchical federated learning
framework that efficiently handles heterogeneous image quality across
resource-constrained mobile devices. Our approach trains specialized local
models for different image quality levels and aggregates their features using a
quality-weighted fusion mechanism, while incorporating differential privacy
protection. Experiments on MNIST demonstrate that QA-HFL achieves 92.31%
accuracy after just three federation rounds, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods like FedRolex (86.42%). Under strict privacy
constraints, our approach maintains 30.77% accuracy with formal differential
privacy guarantees. Counter-intuitively, low-end devices contributed most
significantly (63.5%) to the final model despite using 100 fewer parameters
than high-end counterparts. Our quality-aware approach addresses accuracy
decline through device-specific regularization, adaptive weighting, intelligent
client selection, and server-side knowledge distillation, while maintaining
efficient communication with a 4.71% compression ratio. Statistical analysis
confirms that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods (p 0.01)
under both standard and privacy-constrained conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的广泛应用，理解和减少其不安全行为变得至关重要。现有的解释技术与安全之间的联系常被忽视。

Method: 提出一个统一框架，连接安全导向的解释方法、安全增强措施及其实操工具，并按LLM工作流程阶段分类总结了近70项研究。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) see wider real-world use, understanding and
mitigating their unsafe behaviors is critical. Interpretation techniques can
reveal causes of unsafe outputs and guide safety, but such connections with
safety are often overlooked in prior surveys. We present the first survey that
bridges this gap, introducing a unified framework that connects safety-focused
interpretation methods, the safety enhancements they inform, and the tools that
operationalize them. Our novel taxonomy, organized by LLM workflow stages,
summarizes nearly 70 works at their intersections. We conclude with open
challenges and future directions. This timely survey helps researchers and
practitioners navigate key advancements for safer, more interpretable LLMs.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出IaCGen框架和DPIaC-Eval基准，通过迭代反馈提升IaC模板的可部署性，解决了现有评估忽略部署能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前IaC生成评估仅关注语法正确性，忽略了可部署性这一关键指标，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出IaCGen框架，利用LLM和迭代反馈机制生成可部署的IaC模板；创建DPIaC-Eval基准，包含153个真实场景。

Result: 初始LLM表现差（Claude-3.5和Claude-3.7首次部署成功率仅30.2%和26.8%），但IaCGen显著提升至98%。用户意图对齐（25.2%）和安全性（8.4%）仍是挑战。

Conclusion: 论文首次全面评估了可部署性为中心的IaC生成，为未来研究奠定基础，但用户意图和安全性仍需改进。

Abstract: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) generation holds significant promise for
automating cloud infrastructure provisioning. Recent advances in Large Language
Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by
generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language
descriptions, but current evaluation focuses on syntactic correctness while
ignoring deployability, the fatal measure of IaC template utility. We address
this gap through two contributions: (1) IaCGen, an LLM-based
deployability-centric framework that uses iterative feedback mechanism to
generate IaC templates, and (2) DPIaC-Eval, a deployability-centric IaC
template benchmark consists of 153 real-world scenarios that can evaluate
syntax, deployment, user intent, and security. Our evaluation reveals that
state-of-the-art LLMs initially performed poorly, with Claude-3.5 and
Claude-3.7 achieving only 30.2% and 26.8% deployment success on the first
attempt respectively. However, IaCGen transforms this performance dramatically:
all evaluated models reach over 90% passItr@25, with Claude-3.5 and Claude-3.7
achieving 98% success rate. Despite these improvements, critical challenges
remain in user intent alignment (25.2% accuracy) and security compliance (8.4%
pass rate), highlighting areas requiring continued research. Our work provides
the first comprehensive assessment of deployability-centric IaC template
generation and establishes a foundation for future research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的代理系统，用于生成高质量的编程竞赛测试用例，并应用于CodeContests数据集，创建了改进版本CodeContests+。实验表明，新测试用例显著提高了评估准确性和强化学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于编程竞赛的高推理难度和精确反馈特性，它成为训练和评估大型语言模型推理能力的重要任务。然而，测试用例难以获取，因此生成高质量测试用例对构建大规模数据集至关重要。

Method: 引入基于LLM的代理系统生成高质量测试用例，应用于CodeContests数据集，创建CodeContests+版本。

Result: CodeContests+的测试用例在评估中表现出显著更高的准确性，特别是真阳性率（TPR）明显提升。强化学习实验也证实了测试用例质量改进带来的优势。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的代理系统能有效生成高质量测试用例，显著提升编程竞赛数据集的评估准确性和强化学习效果。

Abstract: Competitive programming, due to its high reasoning difficulty and precise
correctness feedback, has become a key task for both training and evaluating
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, while a
large amount of public problem data, such as problem statements and solutions,
is available, the test cases of these problems are often difficult to obtain.
Therefore, test case generation is a necessary task for building large-scale
datasets, and the quality of the test cases directly determines the accuracy of
the evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based agent system that
creates high-quality test cases for competitive programming problems. We apply
this system to the CodeContests dataset and propose a new version with improved
test cases, named CodeContests+. We evaluated the quality of test cases in
CodeContestsPlus. First, we used 1.72 million submissions with pass/fail labels
to examine the accuracy of these test cases in evaluation. The results
indicated that CodeContests+ achieves significantly higher accuracy than
CodeContests, particularly with a notably higher True Positive Rate (TPR).
Subsequently, our experiments in LLM Reinforcement Learning (RL) further
confirmed that improvements in test case quality yield considerable advantages
for RL.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合环境属性地图（EAM）和多层次语言模型推理模块（MHR）的主动目标导航框架，以解决零样本目标导航（ZSON）在未知开放环境中的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本目标导航在未知开放环境中因忽视高维隐式场景信息和长距离目标搜索任务而性能显著下降。

Method: 通过EAM（利用SBERT和Diffusion预测环境属性）和MHR（基于EAM进行前沿探索决策）提升导航成功率和效率。

Result: EAM在MP3D数据集上达到64.5%的场景映射准确率，导航任务在HM3D和MP3D基准上的SPL分别为28.4%和26.3%，比基线方法分别提升21.4%和46.0%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了零样本目标导航的性能和效率，验证了EAM和MHR的有效性。

Abstract: The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments
coupled with semantically novel target often suffers from the significant
decline in performance due to the neglect of high-dimensional implicit scene
information and the long-range target searching task. To address this, we
proposed an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes
Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve its success
rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with
SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space
regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR
is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding
the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\% scene
mapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of
28.4\% and 26.3\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing
absolute improvements of 21.4\% and 46.0\% over baseline methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于3D光流的世界模型，通过人类和机器人操作数据学习物体在3D空间中的运动，以指导机器人动作规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作任务缺乏大规模统一的数据集，限制了机器人学习统一且鲁棒的动作表示。人类通过理解物体在3D空间中的运动来指导操作，这一线索适用于不同机器人。

Method: 合成大规模3D光流数据集ManiFlow-110k，基于视频扩散的世界模型学习操作物理，生成语言指令条件下的3D光流轨迹，并通过流引导渲染和GPT-4o评估任务对齐。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样化机器人操作任务中具有强泛化能力，且无需硬件特定训练即可实现跨具身适应。

Conclusion: 3D光流世界模型为机器人操作任务提供了一种统一且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于不同机器人和场景。

Abstract: Manipulation has long been a challenging task for robots, while humans can
effortlessly perform complex interactions with objects, such as hanging a cup
on the mug rack. A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for
teaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot
action in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot
to learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within
diverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find
that understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical
clue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for
both humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow
world model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts
the future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action
planning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical
flow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect
pipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics
from these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on
language instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a
flow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and
leverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task
description. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability.
Finally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an
optimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic
manipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without
hardware-specific training.

Conclusion: 当前机器可执行的腹侧视觉流模型能够设计非侵入性、视觉传递的神经干预方法，分辨率达单个神经元。

Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the
brain while leaving nearby neurons unaffected -- is an outstanding challenge in
neuroscience, generally achieved through invasive techniques. This study
investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural
activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on
one's natural visual feed. When tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural
populations, we found quantitative agreement between the model-predicted and
biologically realized effect: strong modulation concentrated on targeted neural
sites. We extended this to demonstrate accurate injection of
experimenter-chosen neural population patterns via subtle perturbations applied
on the background of typical natural visual feeds. These results highlight that
current machine-executable models of the ventral stream can now design
noninvasive, visually-delivered, possibly imperceptible neural interventions at
the resolution of individual neurons.

*Yangui Fang,Jing Peng,Xu Li,Yu Xi,Chengwei Zhang,Guohui Zhong,Kai Yu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出一种仅使用文本的微调策略，用于语音大语言模型的领域适应，无需额外音频数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音大语言模型在新领域的适应仍具挑战性，尤其在低资源环境下缺乏成对的语音-文本数据。

Method: 引入实时评估机制，仅使用目标域的非配对文本进行微调，保持语音-文本对齐。

Result: 在LibriSpeech、SlideSpeech和Medical数据集上表现优异，性能接近全音频-文本微调，且能有效泛化到新领域。

Conclusion: 文本微调策略为低资源ASR领域适应提供了潜力，避免了灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have combined speech
encoders with large language models (LLMs) through projection, forming Speech
LLMs with strong performance. However, adapting them to new domains remains
challenging, especially in low-resource settings where paired speech-text data
is scarce. We propose a text-only fine-tuning strategy for Speech LLMs using
unpaired target-domain text without requiring additional audio. To preserve
speech-text alignment, we introduce a real-time evaluation mechanism during
fine-tuning. This enables effective domain adaptation while maintaining
source-domain performance. Experiments on LibriSpeech, SlideSpeech, and Medical
datasets show that our method achieves competitive recognition performance,
with minimal degradation compared to full audio-text fine-tuning. It also
improves generalization to new domains without catastrophic forgetting,
highlighting the potential of text-only fine-tuning for low-resource domain
adaptation of ASR.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了使用音频感知大语言模型（ALLMs）作为自动评估工具，评估语音生成模型的说话风格表现。通过比较ALLMs（GPT-4o-audio和Gemini-2.5-pro）与人类评估结果，发现Gemini与人类评估者的一致性较高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是验证ALLMs能否作为评估语音生成模型（SLMs）说话风格的可靠工具，并探索当前SLMs在说话风格控制上的局限性。

Method: 使用四种语音生成模型（SLMs）完成两项任务（语音风格指令跟随和角色扮演），并通过人类和ALLMs（GPT-4o-audio和Gemini-2.5-pro）评估其表现。

Result: Gemini与人类评估者的一致性接近人类评估者之间的一致性，表明ALLMs可作为评估工具。同时发现当前SLMs在说话风格控制和自然对话生成上仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: ALLMs（尤其是Gemini）可作为评估语音生成模型的可靠工具，但SLMs在说话风格控制方面仍需进一步优化。

Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) can understand the textual and
non-textual information in the audio input. In this paper, we explore using
ALLMs as an automatic judge to assess the speaking styles of speeches. We use
ALLM judges to evaluate the speeches generated by SLMs on two tasks: voice
style instruction following and role-playing. The speaking style we consider
includes emotion, volume, speaking pace, word emphasis, pitch control, and
non-verbal elements. We use four spoken language models (SLMs) to complete the
two tasks and use humans and ALLMs to judge the SLMs' responses. We compare two
ALLM judges, GPT-4o-audio and Gemini-2.5-pro, with human evaluation results and
show that the agreement between Gemini and human judges is comparable to the
agreement between human evaluators. These promising results show that ALLMs can
be used as a judge to evaluate SLMs. Our results also reveal that current SLMs,
even GPT-4o-audio, still have room for improvement in controlling the speaking
style and generating natural dialogues.

TL;DR: CO-VADA是一种无需修改模型架构或依赖人口统计信息的去偏方法，通过语音转换生成样本以减少语音情感识别中的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音情感识别系统常因说话者特征与情感标签之间的虚假相关性而产生偏见，现有去偏方法多需模型修改或人口统计信息，实用性受限。

Method: CO-VADA识别反映训练数据偏见的样本，通过语音转换改变无关属性生成新样本，增加说话者多样性。

Result: 该方法兼容多种语音情感识别模型和语音转换工具，提升系统公平性。

Conclusion: CO-VADA为语音情感识别系统提供了一种可扩展且实用的去偏解决方案。

Abstract: Bias in speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often stems from spurious
correlations between speaker characteristics and emotional labels, leading to
unfair predictions across demographic groups. Many existing debiasing methods
require model-specific changes or demographic annotations, limiting their
practical use. We present CO-VADA, a Confidence-Oriented Voice Augmentation
Debiasing Approach that mitigates bias without modifying model architecture or
relying on demographic information. CO-VADA identifies training samples that
reflect bias patterns present in the training data and then applies voice
conversion to alter irrelevant attributes and generate samples. These augmented
samples introduce speaker variations that differ from dominant patterns in the
data, guiding the model to focus more on emotion-relevant features. Our
framework is compatible with various SER models and voice conversion tools,
making it a scalable and practical solution for improving fairness in SER
systems.

Motivation: 研究AI推理能力的进步是否真正提升了人类与AI之间的知识传递能力，即人类能否理解、应用和学习AI的推理过程。

Method: 提出KITE框架，通过两阶段实验（人类与AI共同构思策略，人类独立实施解决方案）评估知识传递能力，涉及118名参与者。

Result: 模型性能与协作效果相关，但关系不稳定，存在显著异常值，表明知识传递需要专门优化。

Conclusion: 知识传递能力需要针对性优化，研究提供了行为与策略因素的分析，并开源了代码和数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI reasoning have driven substantial improvements
across diverse tasks. A critical open question is whether these improvements
also yields better knowledge transfer: the ability of models to communicate
reasoning in ways humans can understand, apply, and learn from. To investigate
this, we introduce Knowledge Integration and Transfer Evaluation (KITE), a
conceptual and experimental framework for Human-AI knowledge transfer
capabilities and conduct the first large-scale human study (N=118) explicitly
designed to measure it. In our two-phase setup, humans first ideate with an AI
on problem-solving strategies, then independently implement solutions,
isolating model explanations' influence on human understanding. Our findings
reveal that although model benchmark performance correlates with collaborative
outcomes, this relationship is notably inconsistent, featuring significant
outliers, indicating that knowledge transfer requires dedicated optimization.
Our analysis identifies behavioral and strategic factors mediating successful
knowledge transfer. We release our code, dataset, and evaluation framework to
support future work on communicatively aligned models.

TL;DR: MMTU是一个大规模基准测试，包含25个真实世界表格任务的30K问题，旨在全面评估模型在专家级表格理解、推理和操作方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在表格处理方面取得了显著进展，但相关能力的全面基准测试仍然有限，限制了我们对模型在这一领域进展的理解。

Method: MMTU基准测试从几十年的计算机科学研究中提取复杂表格任务，涵盖25种任务类型，共30K问题。

Result: 前沿模型（如OpenAI o4-mini和DeepSeek R1）在MMTU上的得分仅为60%左右，表明仍有较大改进空间。

Conclusion: MMTU为结构化数据处理和分析的基础模型发展提供了重要基准，有望推动进一步进展。

Abstract: Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important
real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational
notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers,
data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown
remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database
copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains
limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks,
evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like
NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks
that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model
progress in this important area.
  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K
questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively
evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at
the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science
research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by
professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills --
including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging
for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI
o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for
improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope
that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing
foundation models for structured data processing and analysis. Our code and
data are available at https://github.com/MMTU-Benchmark/MMTU and

Motivation: 现有约束解码方法会扭曲模型分布，影响多样性，尤其在程序模糊测试中需要多样且有效的输入。

Method: 构建有效输出的提议分布，结合Metropolis-Hastings接受准则，确保对约束空间的探索。

Result: 在合成基准和实际程序模糊测试任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新框架在满足约束的同时高效收敛，适用于需要多样性和有效性的任务。

Abstract: Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that
provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding
approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that
is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants
to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a
new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying
(every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling
process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient
(high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal
distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient
exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms
existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing
tasks.

a large-scale synthetic dialogue dataset spanning multiple domains. Second, we
develop a suite of automatic evaluation metrics, validated through extensive
human studies. Third, we propose an end-to-end model that processes streaming

novel techniques for handling data imbalance and long-duration videos. This
work lays the foundation for developing real-time, proactive AI assistants

one-size-fits-all approach, lacking the flexibility to respond to users'
varying needs and preferences. This limitation motivates us to develop
PersonaAgent, the first personalized LLM agent framework designed to address
versatile personalization tasks. Specifically, PersonaAgent integrates two
complementary components - a personalized memory module that includes episodic
and semantic memory mechanisms; a personalized action module that enables the
agent to perform tool actions tailored to the user. At the core, the persona
(defined as unique system prompt for each user) functions as an intermediary:
it leverages insights from personalized memory to control agent actions, while
the outcomes of these actions in turn refine the memory. Based on the
framework, we propose a test-time user-preference alignment strategy that
simulate the latest n interactions to optimize the persona prompt, ensuring
real-time user preference alignment through textual loss feedback between
simulated and ground-truth responses. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
PersonaAgent significantly outperforms other baseline methods by not only
personalizing the action space effectively but also scaling during test-time
real-world applications. These results underscore the feasibility and potential
of our approach in delivering tailored, dynamic user experiences.

*Daniel Wang,Patrick Rim,Tian Tian,Alex Wong,Ganesh Sundaramoorthi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ODE-GS结合3D高斯喷溅与潜在神经ODE，用于预测动态3D场景，超越训练时间范围，实现状态最优外推。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染系统（如NeRF或3DGS）在时间外推时表现不佳，ODE-GS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过冻结时间条件变形模型，训练Transformer编码器总结高斯轨迹，并用神经ODE控制潜在状态演化。

Result: 在D-NeRF和NVFI基准测试中，PSNR提升达10 dB，LPIPS误差减半。

Conclusion: 连续时间潜在动力学是实现复杂3D场景真实预测的有效方法。

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with
latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D
scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering
systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation
network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict
the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS
eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned
deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer
encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose
continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this
latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can
be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a
variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS
attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving
PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the
strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent
dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of
complex 3D scenes.

TL;DR: SurGSplat是一种新颖的3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）方法，通过几何约束逐步优化，解决了内窥镜场景中稀疏特征和光照不一致导致的3D重建问题，提升了手术导航的精确性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜手术场景中，稀疏特征和不一致光照导致现有Structure-from-Motion（SfM）方法重建失败，影响手术导航的准确性和安全性。

Method: 提出SurGSplat方法，通过几何约束逐步优化3D高斯泼溅（3DGS），实现血管结构等关键特征的详细重建。

Result: 实验表明，SurGSplat在新视角合成（NVS）和姿态估计精度上表现优异，为手术场景重建提供了高保真且高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: SurGSplat通过几何约束优化3DGS，显著提升了内窥镜手术场景的3D重建质量，为手术导航提供了更清晰的视觉支持。

Abstract: Intraoperative navigation relies heavily on precise 3D reconstruction to
ensure accuracy and safety during surgical procedures. However, endoscopic
scenarios present unique challenges, including sparse features and inconsistent
lighting, which render many existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based methods
inadequate and prone to reconstruction failure. To mitigate these constraints,
we propose SurGSplat, a novel paradigm designed to progressively refine 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By
enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical
features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity,
facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view
synthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a
high-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction. More

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: QualitEye是一种验证图像视线数据质量的方法，通过语义表示和隐私保护协议，在公开和隐私保护场景下均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视线数据集的增加，数据质量和隐私问题成为挑战，需要一种方法验证数据质量并保护隐私。

Method: QualitEye使用新的语义表示方法，结合隐私保护协议（如私有集合交集），在公开和隐私保护场景下验证数据质量。

Result: 在MPIIFaceGaze和GazeCapture数据集上验证性能高，隐私保护版本的运行时开销小。

Conclusion: QualitEye为机器学习、人机交互和密码学交叉领域的视线分析提供了新方法。

Abstract: Gaze-based applications are increasingly advancing with the availability of
large datasets but ensuring data quality presents a substantial challenge when
collecting data at scale. It further requires different parties to collaborate,
therefore, privacy concerns arise. We propose QualitEye--the first method for
verifying image-based gaze data quality. QualitEye employs a new semantic
representation of eye images that contains the information required for
verification while excluding irrelevant information for better domain
adaptation. QualitEye covers a public setting where parties can freely exchange
data and a privacy-preserving setting where parties cannot reveal their raw
data nor derive gaze features/labels of others with adapted private set
intersection protocols. We evaluate QualitEye on the MPIIFaceGaze and
GazeCapture datasets and achieve a high verification performance (with a small
overhead in runtime for privacy-preserving versions). Hence, QualitEye paves
the way for new gaze analysis methods at the intersection of machine learning,
human-computer interaction, and cryptography.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性伤口在老年人群中日益普遍，传统护理方式资源密集且效率低，亟需创新解决方案。

Method: 开发了WoundAIssist应用，集成了轻量级深度学习模型进行伤口分割，支持患者在家拍照和填写问卷，医生远程监控。

Result: 可用性研究显示应用易用性强，AI伤口识别功能受到患者和皮肤科医生的好评。

Conclusion: WoundAIssist填补了患者与医疗人员之间的鸿沟，并为远程患者监测应用提供了设计参考。

Abstract: The rising prevalence of chronic wounds, especially in aging populations,
presents a significant healthcare challenge due to prolonged hospitalizations,
elevated costs, and reduced patient quality of life. Traditional wound care is
resource-intensive, requiring frequent in-person visits that strain both
patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, we present
WoundAIssist, a patient-centered, AI-driven mobile application designed to
support telemedical wound care. WoundAIssist enables patients to regularly
document wounds at home via photographs and questionnaires, while physicians
remain actively engaged in the care process through remote monitoring and video
consultations. A distinguishing feature is an integrated lightweight deep
learning model for on-device wound segmentation, which, combined with
patient-reported data, enables continuous monitoring of wound healing
progression. Developed through an iterative, user-centered process involving
both patients and domain experts, WoundAIssist prioritizes an user-friendly
design, particularly for elderly patients. A conclusive usability study with
patients and dermatologists reported excellent usability, good app quality, and
favorable perceptions of the AI-driven wound recognition. Our main contribution
is two-fold: (I) the implementation and (II) evaluation of WoundAIssist, an
easy-to-use yet comprehensive telehealth solution designed to bridge the gap
between patients and HCPs. Additionally, we synthesize design insights for
remote patient monitoring apps, derived from over three years of
interdisciplinary research, that may inform the development of similar digital
health tools across clinical domains.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: MLM4HG提出了一种基于掩码语言建模的方法，通过元路径文本序列统一异构图任务，提升了跨域和多任务的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构图神经网络（HGNNs）在跨域和任务泛化方面表现不佳，且与大型语言模型（LLMs）结合时存在嵌入空间差异问题。

Method: MLM4HG将异构图转换为基于元路径的文本序列，并设计统一的任务模板，通过掩码预测范式进行微调。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，MLM4HG在少样本和零样本场景下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MLM4HG通过文本化异构图任务，显著提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing structural and
semantic information in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), while struggling to
generalize across domains and tasks. Recently, some researchers have turned to
integrating HGNNs with large language models (LLMs) for more generalizable
heterogeneous graph learning. However, these approaches typically extract
structural information via HGNNs as HG tokens, and disparities in embedding
spaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias the LLM's comprehension
of HGs. Moreover, as these HG tokens are often derived from node-level tasks,
the model's ability to generalize across tasks remains limited. To this end, we
propose a simple yet effective Masked Language Modeling-based method, called
MLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual sequences instead of HG tokens
to extract structural and semantic information inherent in HGs, and designs
customized textual templates to unify different graph tasks into a coherent
cloze-style "mask" token prediction paradigm. Specifically, MLM4HG first
converts HGs from various domains to texts based on metapaths, and subsequently
combines them with the unified task texts to form a HG-based corpus. Moreover,
the corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for fine-tuning with a constrained
target vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to generalize to unseen target
HGs. Extensive cross-domain and multi-task experiments on four real-world
datasets demonstrate the superior generalization performance of MLM4HG over
state-of-the-art methods in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. Our code is
available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/MLM4HG.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本TTS中的语音印象控制方法，通过低维向量表示语音印象强度，并结合大语言模型生成目标印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音中的副语言/非语言信息对听者印象至关重要，但现有零样本TTS在控制这些信息上仍有挑战。

Method: 使用低维向量表示语音印象对（如暗-亮）的强度，并通过大语言模型从自然语言描述生成目标印象向量。

Result: 主客观评估验证了该方法在印象控制上的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了无需手动优化的目标印象生成，提升了零样本TTS的灵活性。

Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the
listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved
high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to
control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains
challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in
zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the
intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results
of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's
effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a
large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural
language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for
manual optimization.

TL;DR: 论文研究了CTC中隐式上下文依赖的内部语言模型（ILM），提出了基于知识蒸馏（KD）的新方法，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CTC假设标签上下文独立，但由于现代强大编码器，它仍能隐式学习上下文依赖的ILM。本文旨在探究CTC中ILM的隐式上下文依赖性。

Method: 提出了基于知识蒸馏（KD）的上下文依赖ILM估计方法，并引入两种正则化方法。实验在Librispeech和TED-LIUM Release 2数据集上进行。

Result: 实验结果表明，上下文依赖的ILM在跨域评估中优于上下文独立先验，且提出的标签级KD平滑方法在词错误率上相对提升了13%以上。

Conclusion: CTC确实学习了上下文依赖的ILM，提出的方法在性能上显著优于其他ILM估计方法。

Abstract: Although connectionist temporal classification (CTC) has the label context
independence assumption, it can still implicitly learn a context-dependent
internal language model (ILM) due to modern powerful encoders. In this work, we
investigate the implicit context dependency modeled in the ILM of CTC. To this
end, we propose novel context-dependent ILM estimation methods for CTC based on
knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical justifications. Furthermore, we
introduce two regularization methods for KD. We conduct experiments on
Librispeech and TED-LIUM Release 2 datasets for in-domain and cross-domain
evaluation, respectively. Experimental results show that context-dependent ILMs
outperform the context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation,
indicating that CTC learns a context-dependent ILM. The proposed label-level KD
with smoothing method surpasses other ILM estimation approaches, with more than
13% relative improvement in word error rate compared to shallow fusion.

TL;DR: RETENTION框架通过迭代剪枝和树映射方案，显著降低了基于树的模型在CAM中的容量需求，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在非结构化数据上表现优异，但基于树的集成模型在结构化数据上仍占优势。现有CAM加速方案存在内存消耗大和利用率低的问题。

Method: 提出RETENTION框架，包括针对bagging模型的迭代剪枝算法和创新的树映射方案，以减少CAM容量需求。

Result: 实验显示，树映射方案单独实现1.46×至21.30×的空间效率提升，完整RETENTION框架提升4.35×至207.12×，精度损失小于3%。

Conclusion: RETENTION有效降低了CAM容量需求，为基于树的模型加速提供了高效资源利用的方向。

Abstract: Although deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning
from unstructured data, modern tree-based ensemble models remain superior in
extracting relevant information and learning from structured datasets. While
several efforts have been made to accelerate tree-based models, the inherent
characteristics of the models pose significant challenges for conventional
accelerators. Recent research leveraging content-addressable memory (CAM)
offers a promising solution for accelerating tree-based models, yet existing
designs suffer from excessive memory consumption and low utilization. This work
addresses these challenges by introducing RETENTION, an end-to-end framework
that significantly reduces CAM capacity requirement for tree-based model
inference. We propose an iterative pruning algorithm with a novel pruning
criterion tailored for bagging-based models (e.g., Random Forest), which
minimizes model complexity while ensuring controlled accuracy degradation.
Additionally, we present a tree mapping scheme that incorporates two innovative
data placement strategies to alleviate the memory redundancy caused by the
widespread use of don't care states in CAM. Experimental results show that
implementing the tree mapping scheme alone achieves $1.46\times$ to $21.30
\times$ better space efficiency, while the full RETENTION framework yields
$4.35\times$ to $207.12\times$ improvement with less than 3% accuracy loss.
These results demonstrate that RETENTION is highly effective in reducing CAM
capacity requirement, providing a resource-efficient direction for tree-based
model acceleration.

Conclusion: FedBE显著提升了联邦微调的性能和适应性，适用于异构分布式环境。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FedFT) of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as
a promising solution for adapting models to distributed data environments while
ensuring data privacy.
  Existing FedFT methods predominantly utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques to reduce communication and computation overhead.
  However, they often fail to adequately address the catastrophic forgetting, a
critical challenge arising from continual adaptation in distributed
environments. The traditional centralized fine-tuning methods, which are not
designed for the heterogeneous and privacy-constrained nature of federated
environments, struggle to mitigate this issue effectively. Moreover, the
challenge is further exacerbated by significant variation in data distributions
and device capabilities across clients, which leads to intensified forgetting
and degraded model generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose FedBE, a
novel FedFT framework that integrates an adaptive transformer block expansion
mechanism with a dynamic trainable-block allocation strategy. Specifically,
FedBE expands trainable blocks within the model architecture, structurally
separating newly learned task-specific knowledge from the original pre-trained
representations. Additionally, FedBE dynamically assigns these trainable blocks
to clients based on their data distributions and computational capabilities.
This enables the framework to better accommodate heterogeneous federated
environments and enhances the generalization ability of the model.Extensive
experiments show that compared with existing federated fine-tuning methods,
FedBE achieves 12-74% higher accuracy retention on general tasks after
fine-tuning and a model convergence acceleration ratio of 1.9-3.1x without
degrading the accuracy of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 任务特定参数映射是提高小型模型性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Modern Foundation Models (FMs) are typically trained on corpora spanning a
wide range of different data modalities, topics and downstream tasks. Utilizing
these models can be very computationally expensive and is out of reach for most
consumer devices. Furthermore, most of the broad FM knowledge may actually be
irrelevant for a specific task at hand. Here we explore a technique for mapping
parameters of a large Transformer to parameters of a smaller specialized model.
By making this transformation task-specific, we aim to capture a narrower scope
of the knowledge needed for performing a specific task by a smaller model. We
study our method on image modeling tasks, showing that performance of generated
models exceeds that of universal conditional models.

Conclusion: BAQ通过优化位宽分配显著提升量化效果，理论分析支持其性能优势。

Abstract: Post-training model quantization is a widely adopted technique for reducing
the memory and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). However,
most existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,
failing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization
noise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization
bitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make
key assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be
expressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat
formulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose
closed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise
quantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as
the equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed
\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
achieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows
BAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal
overhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,
achieving up to 56$\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large
language models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters. Leveraging our analytical
results derived from solving the optimal bit allocation problem, we also
provide a theoretical explanation for the observed gains. All codes of this
paper are available at https://github.com/CSU-ModelCompression/BAQ.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Transformers excel at text processing,
but their reliance on prompts for specialized behavior introduces computational
overhead. We propose a modification to a Transformer architecture that
eliminates the need for explicit prompts by learning to encode context into the
model's weights. Our Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) model maintains a
contextual summary at each sequence position, allowing it to update the weights
on the fly based on the preceding context. This approach enables the model to
self-specialize, effectively creating a tailored model for processing
information following a given prefix. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on synthetic in-context learning tasks and language modeling benchmarks.
Furthermore, we introduce techniques for enhancing the interpretability of the
learned contextual representations, drawing connections to Variational
Autoencoders and promoting smoother, more consistent context encoding. This
work offers a novel direction for efficient and adaptable language modeling by
integrating context directly into the model's architecture.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对小语言模型（SLMs）的表格推理方法Table-r1，通过程序化推理（P-TR）解决了文本推理（T-TR）在数值推理上的局限性，并提升了表格布局泛化和推理一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型（SLMs）在表格推理（TR）任务中表现较差，尤其是面对异构表格布局和数值推理时。论文旨在缩小SLMs与大型语言模型（LLMs）在TR任务上的性能差距。

Method: 提出Table-r1方法，分为两阶段：1）通过自监督学习任务Layout Transformation Inference提升表格布局泛化能力；2）采用混合范式的Group Relative Policy Optimization增强推理一致性，并支持动态回退到文本推理（T-TR）。

Result: 在四个TR基准测试中，Table-r1显著优于其他SLM方法，准确率比基础模型（LLaMA-8B）提升至少15%，且性能接近LLMs。

Conclusion: Table-r1通过程序化推理和混合优化策略，有效提升了SLMs在表格推理任务中的表现，缩小了与LLMs的差距。

Abstract: Table reasoning (TR) requires structured reasoning over semi-structured
tabular data and remains challenging, particularly for small language models
(SLMs, e.g., LLaMA-8B) due to their limited capacity compared to large LMs
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o). To narrow this gap, we explore program-based TR (P-TR),
which circumvents key limitations of text-based TR (T-TR), notably in numerical
reasoning, by generating executable programs. However, applying P-TR to SLMs
introduces two challenges: (i) vulnerability to heterogeneity in table layouts,
and (ii) inconsistency in reasoning due to limited code generation capability.
We propose Table-r1, a two-stage P-TR method designed for SLMs. Stage 1
introduces an innovative self-supervised learning task, Layout Transformation
Inference, to improve tabular layout generalization from a programmatic view.
Stage 2 adopts a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization,
enhancing P-TR consistency while allowing dynamic fallback to T-TR when needed.
Experiments on four TR benchmarks demonstrate that Table-r1 outperforms all
SLM-based methods, achieving at least a 15% accuracy improvement over the base
model (LLaMA-8B) across all datasets and reaching performance competitive with
LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类用户之间的反馈循环，发现这种循环可能导致信念固化、多样性丧失和错误信念锁定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs与人类用户互动中形成的反馈循环如何影响信念多样性，并验证其可能导致错误信念的固化。

Method: 通过基于代理的LLM模拟和真实GPT使用数据，形式化并测试反馈循环假说。

Result: 分析显示，新GPT版本发布后，多样性出现突然且持续的下降，与假说一致。

Conclusion: 人类与AI的反馈循环可能导致信念固化和多样性丧失，需引起关注。

Abstract: The training and deployment of large language models (LLMs) create a feedback
loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these
beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them
back to users again and again. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber. We
hypothesize that this feedback loop entrenches the existing values and beliefs
of users, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially the lock-in of false
beliefs. We formalize this hypothesis and test it empirically with agent-based
LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data. Analysis reveals sudden but
sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations,
consistent with the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop. Code and data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型因固定的从左到右令牌生成方式导致错误累积，需要一种方法来缓解这一问题。

Method: 提出RPT方法，通过迭代重新访问和替换先前生成的令牌窗口中的内容，同时保持模型的预测质量和速度。

Result: 在8B参数模型上仅用100B数据进行微调，RPT相比标准采样在推理和编码任务上实现了约10%的相对提升。

Conclusion: RPT是一种有效的方法，能够显著减少自回归模型中的错误累积，提升任务性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models accumulate errors due to their fixed,
irrevocable left-to-right token generation. To address this, we propose a new
sampling method called Resample-Previous-Tokens (RPT). RPT mitigates error
accumulation by iteratively revisiting and potentially replacing tokens in a
window of previously generated text. This method can be integrated into
existing autoregressive models, preserving their next-token-prediction quality
and speed. Fine-tuning a pretrained 8B parameter model with RPT for only 100B
resulted in ~10% relative improvements on reasoning and coding benchmarks
compared to the standard sampling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将所有网络参数视为同等重要，忽略了不同层编码不同信息的特点，导致归属结果不准确。

Method: 通过学习参数重要性权重，使归属过程适应模型结构，捕捉训练数据对输出特定语义方面（如主题、风格或背景）的贡献。

Result: 方法在扩散模型中提高了归属准确性，并提供了对输出如何从训练数据中借鉴的细粒度洞察。

Conclusion: 该方法改进了生成模型中的数据归属，能够更准确地识别影响输出的训练数据。

Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which
training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this
by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all
network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode
different types of information and may thus draw information differently from
the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter
importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data.
This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model,
capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an
output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution
accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how
outputs borrow from training data.

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly
diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks,
is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally
dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were
primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and
hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced
"Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality,
structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model
performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the
DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately
10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by
extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision
dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets.
Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog,
the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and
multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we
document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models
against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our
evaluation publicly available.

<details>

Motivation: 在多标签分类中，负数据（未分配类别的实例）过多会干扰学习过程，影响正实例的准确分类。现有方法通过单独分配负类会引入冗余，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 重新设计标准MLC损失函数，通过归一化加权几何平均预测类别概率，计算任何类别存在的似然，并引入正则化参数控制负类概率对似然的影响。

Result: 在SewerML、COCO和ChestX-ray14数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了MLC性能，F1、F2和平均精度分别提高了6.01、8.06和3.11个百分点。

Conclusion: 提出的损失函数在不增加参数或计算复杂度的情况下，有效解决了负数据问题，提升了多标签分类性能。

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more
non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large
proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,
which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification
and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC
applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease
identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative
data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further
complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To
address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a
likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted
geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a
regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent
class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances.
The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by
encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and
improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments
on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and
ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our
loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss
counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in
F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or
computational complexity. Code available at:

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search
(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation
costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of
predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While
traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the
absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various
ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to
focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,
the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive
study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three
main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we
assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks
across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss
functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.
Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting
appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides
meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for
predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的测试时优化方法，通过减少分类器权重噪声，提升预测置信度的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统不确定性估计方法（如dropout）难以清晰区分可靠与不可靠预测，主要因分类器权重噪声干扰细粒度统计信息。

Method: 提出一种测试时优化方法，考虑噪声影响，生成更可靠的置信度估计，并定义单调子集选择函数。

Result: 在AUSE和AURC等风险指标上表现优异，能有效识别训练与测试分布差异及区分内外分布样本。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了预测置信度的可靠性，并揭示了CNN与ViT分类器在视觉数据集上的关键差异。

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle
to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute
this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall
class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To
address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts
for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.
This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population
accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and
it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as
AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies
between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates
in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key
differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn
multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general
hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant
challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced
optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient
descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the
multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would
hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge
arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different
magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to
interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient
surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting
gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a
novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery
(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient
magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS
surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order
momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS
on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays
a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the
optimisation of the learning process.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The code is available at
[https://github.com/mjalali/embedding-comparison](github.com/mjalali/embedding-comparison).
