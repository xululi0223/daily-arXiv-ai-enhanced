If an open source, easy-to-use, and robust RISC-V\nimplementation could be obtained, it could be easily adapted for pedagogical\nand amateur use. In this work we accomplish three goals in relation to this\noutlook. First, we propose a set of criteria for evaluating the components of a\nRISC-V implementation's ecosystem from a pedagogical perspective. Second, we\nanalyze a number of existing open-source RISC-V implementations to determine\nhow many of the criteria they fulfill. We then develop a comprehensive solution\nthat meets all of these criterion and is released open-source for other\ninstructors to use. The framework is developed in a composable way that it's\ndifferent components can be disaggregated per individual course needs. Finally,\nwe also report on a limited study of student feedback."}

To accurately locate neurons\nresponsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification\nmethod based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By\nsuppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves\nsurgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.\nExperiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the\nmodel's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our\nmethod exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly\noutperforming existing methods."}

We further identify dynamic state\nprediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a\nbenchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to\nfine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.\nMOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on\ngeneral video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently\nyields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,\nconfirming its broad applicability.

However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their\nhigh computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty\nlevel of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of\ndifficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing\ndatasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,\nwhich can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between\n\"Thinking\" and \"NoThinking\" modes. We then train a specialized difficult\nproblem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can\nproduce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for\ncomplex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning\nQwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial\nperformance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a\n65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,\noutperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance\nis achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating\nthat our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities\nwithout relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we\nobserve a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks\nas the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:\nhttps://github.com/QizhiPei/ScaleDiff."}

DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture\nby embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features\ninto a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule\nconsistency and violation penalties in the loss function.

These fundamental limitations create a\npersistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately\nundermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.\n  To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation\nFeed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within\nmainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users\nto passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control\nover recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support\nthis paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser\nAgent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a\nPlanner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly\npolicy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ\nsimulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance\nwhile maintaining strong reasoning capabilities.

Existing robot\nnavigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus\nhighly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present\nReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like\nnavigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language\nmodel (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on\nnavigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and\nreasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and\nshow that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate\nefficiently in large, complex buildings."}

Existing deep learning methods,\nparticularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive\npredictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of\nphysical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously\ncapture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:\nlocal, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,\nwe propose the\n{\\textbf{\\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\\textbf{\\underline{I}}}ntegral\n{\\textbf{\\underline{N}}}eural {\\textbf{\\underline{O}}}perator (\\method{}), a\nnovel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator\ndecomposition. \\method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through\nparallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential\noperator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably\nconverges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a\nTransformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This\nphysics-based decomposition endows \\method{} with exceptional stability and\nrobustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow\nbenchmark, we demonstrate that \\method{} significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses\nerror accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both\nthe vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for\nphysically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast."}

However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is\nextremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to\nexpedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive\nagent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly\nretrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,\nconsidering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways\nfor the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and\nconfirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large\nlanguage models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More\nimportantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when\nuser interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark\nfor personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study\nto verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video\ndataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/."}
