Considering the impressive\nperformance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks, most of the latest TODs are centered on LLMs. While proactive\nplanning is crucial for task completion, many existing TODs overlook effective\ngoal-aware planning. This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented\nconversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to\ndialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate\ninformation in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part\ninformational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating\nintermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational\ncomponents corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible\nconfigurations for these informational components lead to limited information\nstates. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information\nstates and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created.\nEventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is\nimplemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model, database\nqueries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of\nretrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables\npassing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of\ncongruency. Evaluations exploiting the complete test conversations of MultiWOZ,\nwith no more than a domain in a conversation, illustrate maximal inform and\nsuccess, and improvement compared with previous methods."}

Across two types of LLMs, we investigate whether supervised finetuning\ncan improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such\nimprovements generalize across tasks and domains. We finetune the LLMs on\ndatasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and\nevaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation,\nwhere the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise\nconfidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more\nlikely to have correct. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including\nmedical and legal reasoning. Results show that finetuning improves calibration\n(alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher\nconfidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains,\nwhile leaving accuracy unchanged. However, improvements are task-specific:\ntraining on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise\ncomparison, and vice versa. In contrast, multitask finetuning on both forms of\nmetacognition yields broader gains, producing lower calibration error and\nstronger discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations.

A key challenge in this\nproblem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including\ndistinguishing between different models as well as between different\ncheckpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we\nidentify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the\ndecoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that\nrelying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is\nmainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded\ntoken influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model\nconfidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding\ndecoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel\ninformation extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which\ncaptures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals\nmodel-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted\nstructural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory\nAttribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each\ndecoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a\ntrajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher\nlog-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to\nhave been generated by that model.

In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which\ninevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to\ndirectly model \"object\" as the visual equivalence of \"word,\" pushing the model\nto learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate\nour hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach\ncan be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random\npatches.

Furthermore, generalisability to\npatients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German\nCompetence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved\nimproved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED\nand ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the\nvolume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional\nkeyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for\nSAX and 1.73 for LAX.

By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node\ngeneration technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and\nconcurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic\nstrategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning\nprocess systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental\nresults show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset\nand 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and\n7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance\nlanguage agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks."}

The\nsecond, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive\nguide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several\nchallenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and\nachieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these\nmethods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse\nsolution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately\nleading to higher-quality solutions."}

This requires two\ncompeting objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple\nreasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.\nExisting works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly\nuncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while\nothers improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence\npost-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer\nquality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different\nsources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should\nbe calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from\ntokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected\ncorrectness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:\nGreedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.\nCalibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on\nestimated rank-wise correctness.

This paper introduces a principled auditing\nframework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a\ncomprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to\nnot only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical\naudit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing\nnon-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential\nrounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics\nthat expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where\nthe inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level\nutility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used\ndirectly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions\ncomparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework\nsuccessfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and\ninterpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees.

However, the\ntrajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations\nin the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally\ndifferent answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient\nmethods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and\nformalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of\nheterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment\nand hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address\nthis, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage\nNormalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on\ntheir structural properties and computes advantages locally within each\nstratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true\npeers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields\nconditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains\nthe global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard\nnormalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To\nimprove practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly\nblend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse\nsingle-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that\nStratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3\npoints, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more\neffective search policies.
