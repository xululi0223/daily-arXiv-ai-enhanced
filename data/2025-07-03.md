### [1] [MALIBU Benchmark: Multi-Agent LLM Implicit Bias Uncovered](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01019)
*Imran Mirza,Cole Huang,Ishwara Vasista,Rohan Patil,Asli Akalin,Sean O'Brien,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MALIBU是一个评估多智能体系统中LLM隐含社会偏见的基准，通过场景化评估揭示偏见问题，强调需要更细致的检测和公平策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统可能强化LLM的隐含偏见，引发公平和代表性担忧，需开发工具评估和缓解此类问题。

Method: MALIBU通过两阶段评估：1) 对标注特定人口特征的响应评分；2) 比较不同人口特征的响应，选择更优者。

Result: 研究发现偏见缓解可能偏向边缘化群体而非真正中立，需更细致的检测和平衡策略。

Conclusion: 需透明评估基准和平衡公平策略，以减少多智能体系统中的偏见。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems, which consist of multiple AI models interacting within a
shared environment, are increasingly used for persona-based interactions.
However, if not carefully designed, these systems can reinforce implicit biases
in large language models (LLMs), raising concerns about fairness and equitable
representation. We present MALIBU, a novel benchmark developed to assess the
degree to which LLM-based multi-agent systems implicitly reinforce social
biases and stereotypes. MALIBU evaluates bias in LLM-based multi-agent systems
through scenario-based assessments. AI models complete tasks within predefined
contexts, and their responses undergo evaluation by an LLM-based multi-agent
judging system in two phases. In the first phase, judges score responses
labeled with specific demographic personas (e.g., gender, race, religion)
across four metrics. In the second phase, judges compare paired responses
assigned to different personas, scoring them and selecting the superior
response. Our study quantifies biases in LLM-generated outputs, revealing that
bias mitigation may favor marginalized personas over true neutrality,
emphasizing the need for nuanced detection, balanced fairness strategies, and
transparent evaluation benchmarks in multi-agent systems.

### [2] [Event-based evaluation of abstractive news summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01160)
*Huiling You,Samia Touileb,Erik Velldal,Lilja Øvrelid*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件重叠的抽象摘要质量评估方法，通过比较生成摘要、参考摘要和原文的事件信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法依赖人工参考摘要，忽略了事件信息的完整性。

Method: 计算生成摘要、参考摘要和原文之间的事件重叠。

Result: 在挪威数据集上验证，提供了更深入的事件信息分析。

Conclusion: 该方法能更全面地评估摘要的事件信息质量。

Abstract: An abstractive summary of a news article contains its most important
information in a condensed version. The evaluation of automatically generated
summaries by generative language models relies heavily on human-authored
summaries as gold references, by calculating overlapping units or similarity
scores. News articles report events, and ideally so should the summaries. In
this work, we propose to evaluate the quality of abstractive summaries by
calculating overlapping events between generated summaries, reference
summaries, and the original news articles. We experiment on a richly annotated
Norwegian dataset comprising both events annotations and summaries authored by
expert human annotators. Our approach provides more insight into the event
information contained in the summaries.

### [3] [Matching and Linking Entries in Historical Swedish Encyclopedias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01170)
*Simon Börjesson,Erik Ersmark,Pierre Nugues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了瑞典百科全书《Nordisk familjebok》第一版和第二版中地理条目的变化，发现地理焦点从欧洲转向北美、非洲、亚洲、澳大利亚和北欧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是通过数字化版本分析百科全书条目内容的变化，反映瑞典社会的知识变迁。

Method: 使用语义句子嵌入匹配条目，基于Transformer的分类器提取地理条目，并链接到Wikidata。

Result: 发现地理焦点从欧洲转向其他地区，反映了第一次世界大战和新势力崛起的影响。

Conclusion: 研究证实了历史事件对百科全书内容的影响，并提供了数据和代码供进一步研究。

Abstract: The \textit{Nordisk familjebok} is a Swedish encyclopedia from the 19th and
20th centuries. It was written by a team of experts and aimed to be an
intellectual reference, stressing precision and accuracy. This encyclopedia had
four main editions remarkable by their size, ranging from 20 to 38 volumes. As
a consequence, the \textit{Nordisk familjebok} had a considerable influence in
universities, schools, the media, and society overall. As new editions were
released, the selection of entries and their content evolved, reflecting
intellectual changes in Sweden.
  In this paper, we used digitized versions from \textit{Project Runeberg}. We
first resegmented the raw text into entries and matched pairs of entries
between the first and second editions using semantic sentence embeddings. We
then extracted the geographical entries from both editions using a
transformer-based classifier and linked them to Wikidata. This enabled us to
identify geographic trends and possible shifts between the first and second
editions, written between 1876-1899 and 1904-1926, respectively.
  Interpreting the results, we observe a small but significant shift in
geographic focus away from Europe and towards North America, Africa, Asia,
Australia, and northern Scandinavia from the first to the second edition,
confirming the influence of the First World War and the rise of new powers. The
code and data are available on GitHub at

### [4] [MEGA: xLSTM with Multihead Exponential Gated Fusion for Precise Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01213)
*Adamu Lawan,Juhua Pu,Haruna Yunusa,Jawad Muhammad,Muhammad Lawan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于xLSTM和MEGA的新框架，用于提升Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis（ABSA）的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ABSA方法在计算效率与高性能之间难以平衡，xLSTM的潜力尚未在ABSA中充分挖掘。

Method: 结合双向mLSTM架构和部分翻转反向流（PF-mLSTM），并引入多头交叉指数门控融合机制（MECGAF）。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: MEGA框架在ABSA任务中表现出色，平衡了全局上下文与局部相关性，同时提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a critical Natural Language
Processing (NLP) task that extracts aspects from text and determines their
associated sentiments, enabling fine-grained analysis of user opinions.
Existing ABSA methods struggle to balance computational efficiency with high
performance: deep learning models often lack global context, transformers
demand significant computational resources, and Mamba-based approaches face
CUDA dependency and diminished local correlations. Recent advancements in
Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) models, particularly their efficient
modeling of long-range dependencies, have significantly advanced the NLP
community. However, their potential in ABSA remains untapped. To this end, we
propose xLSTM with Multihead Exponential Gated Fusion (MEGA), a novel framework
integrating a bi-directional mLSTM architecture with forward and partially
flipped backward (PF-mLSTM) streams. The PF-mLSTM enhances localized context
modeling by processing the initial sequence segment in reverse with dedicated
parameters, preserving critical short-range patterns. We further introduce an
mLSTM-based multihead cross exponential gated fusion mechanism (MECGAF) that
dynamically combines forward mLSTM outputs as query and key with PF-mLSTM
outputs as value, optimizing short-range dependency capture while maintaining
global context and efficiency. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MEGA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
superior accuracy and efficiency in ABSA tasks.

### [5] [The Medium Is Not the Message: Deconfounding Text Embeddings via Linear Concept Erasure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01234)
*Yu Fan,Yang Tian,Shauli Ravfogel,Mrinmaya Sachan,Elliott Ash,Alexander Hoyle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种去偏算法，通过从编码器表示中移除观察到的混杂因素信息，显著减少了文本嵌入中的偏差，同时计算成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本序列的嵌入相似性度量可能受到无关因素（如文本来源或语言）的干扰，影响跨语料库文本的应用效果。

Method: 采用去偏算法，从编码器表示中移除观察到的混杂因素信息。

Result: 在所有评估的嵌入变体和任务中，文档相似性和聚类指标均显著提升，且不影响分布外基准性能。

Conclusion: 去偏算法能有效减少嵌入偏差，且不损害其他性能。

Abstract: Embedding-based similarity metrics between text sequences can be influenced
not just by the content dimensions we most care about, but can also be biased
by spurious attributes like the text's source or language. These document
confounders cause problems for many applications, but especially those that
need to pool texts from different corpora. This paper shows that a debiasing
algorithm that removes information about observed confounders from the encoder
representations substantially reduces these biases at a minimal computational
cost. Document similarity and clustering metrics improve across every embedding
variant and task we evaluate -- often dramatically. Interestingly, performance
on out-of-distribution benchmarks is not impacted, indicating that the
embeddings are not otherwise degraded.

### [6] [GAIus: Combining Genai with Legal Clauses Retrieval for Knowledge-based Assistant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01259)
*Michał Matak,Jarosław A. Chudziak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型在处理非英语和非中文国家的法律问题时提供答案和引用的能力，提出了一种基于波兰民法典的认知代理gAIus，其检索机制优于嵌入方法，并在波兰法律考试数据集上显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决大型语言模型在处理非主流语言法律问题时缺乏可靠引用和解释能力的问题。

Method: 方法包括提出gAIus架构，结合波兰民法典的检索机制，并通过法律考试数据集评估性能。

Result: 结果显示，gAIus显著提升了GPT-3.5和GPT-4的性能，准确率分别提高了419%和从31%提升至86%。

Conclusion: 结论指出gAIus在非英语法律领域的潜力，并展望了未来研究方向和应用前景。

Abstract: In this paper we discuss the capability of large language models to base
their answer and provide proper references when dealing with legal matters of
non-english and non-chinese speaking country. We discuss the history of legal
information retrieval, the difference between case law and statute law, its
impact on the legal tasks and analyze the latest research in this field. Basing
on that background we introduce gAIus, the architecture of the cognitive
LLM-based agent, whose responses are based on the knowledge retrieved from
certain legal act, which is Polish Civil Code. We propose a retrieval mechanism
which is more explainable, human-friendly and achieves better results than
embedding-based approaches. To evaluate our method we create special dataset
based on single-choice questions from entrance exams for law apprenticeships
conducted in Poland. The proposed architecture critically leveraged the
abilities of used large language models, improving the gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 by
419%, allowing it to beat gpt-4o and lifting gpt-4o-mini score from 31% to 86%.
At the end of our paper we show the possible future path of research and
potential applications of our findings.

### [7] [Evaluating Large Language Models for Multimodal Simulated Ophthalmic Decision-Making in Diabetic Retinopathy and Glaucoma Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01278)
*Cindy Lie Tabuse,David Restepo,Carolina Gracitelli,Fernando Korn Malerbi,Caio Regatieri,Luis Filipe Nakayama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-4在眼科中模拟临床决策的能力有限，尤其在复杂任务中表现不佳，但可能适用于教育和文档辅助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLM）在眼科中的应用潜力，特别是GPT-4在糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）和青光眼筛查中的表现。

Method: 使用300张标注的眼底图像，通过结构化提示描述图像，评估GPT-4在ICDR分级、DR转诊和青光眼转诊任务中的表现，并分析临床元数据的影响。

Result: GPT-4在ICDR分类中表现中等（准确率67.5%），在DR转诊任务中表现较好（准确率82.3%），但在青光眼转诊中表现差（准确率约78%）。元数据对结果无显著影响。

Conclusion: GPT-4可从结构化提示中模拟基本眼科决策，但缺乏复杂任务的精确性，不适合临床使用，可能适用于教育或文档辅助。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can simulate clinical reasoning based on natural
language prompts, but their utility in ophthalmology is largely unexplored.
This study evaluated GPT-4's ability to interpret structured textual
descriptions of retinal fundus photographs and simulate clinical decisions for
diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma screening, including the impact of
adding real or synthetic clinical metadata. We conducted a retrospective
diagnostic validation study using 300 annotated fundus images. GPT-4 received
structured prompts describing each image, with or without patient metadata. The
model was tasked with assigning an ICDR severity score, recommending DR
referral, and estimating the cup-to-disc ratio for glaucoma referral.
Performance was evaluated using accuracy, macro and weighted F1 scores, and
Cohen's kappa. McNemar's test and change rate analysis were used to assess the
influence of metadata. GPT-4 showed moderate performance for ICDR
classification (accuracy 67.5%, macro F1 0.33, weighted F1 0.67, kappa 0.25),
driven mainly by correct identification of normal cases. Performance improved
in the binary DR referral task (accuracy 82.3%, F1 0.54, kappa 0.44). For
glaucoma referral, performance was poor across all settings (accuracy ~78%, F1
<0.04, kappa <0.03). Metadata inclusion did not significantly affect outcomes
(McNemar p > 0.05), and predictions remained consistent across conditions.
GPT-4 can simulate basic ophthalmic decision-making from structured prompts but
lacks precision for complex tasks. While not suitable for clinical use, LLMs
may assist in education, documentation, or image annotation workflows in
ophthalmology.

### [8] [Rethinking All Evidence: Enhancing Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Conflict-Driven Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01281)
*Juan Chen,Baolong Bi,Wei Zhang,Jingyan Sui,Xiaofei Zhu,Yuanzhuo Wang,Lingrui Mei,Shenghua Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARE-RAG通过冲突驱动的证据整合，提升RAG系统的生成可靠性，尤其在噪声或冲突证据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统中因内部知识不一致或检索内容噪声导致的知识冲突问题，提升生成的可信度。

Method: 提出CARE-RAG框架，包括参数感知证据提取、上下文感知证据提炼、冲突驱动总结和QA修复步骤。

Result: 在修订的QA数据集上，CARE-RAG优于现有RAG基线，尤其在噪声或冲突证据场景中。

Conclusion: CARE-RAG通过冲突感知和证据整合，显著提升了RAG系统的可靠性和生成质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating their parametric knowledge with external retrieved content.
However, knowledge conflicts caused by internal inconsistencies or noisy
retrieved content can severely undermine the generation reliability of RAG
systems.In this work, we argue that LLMs should rethink all evidence, including
both retrieved content and internal knowledge, before generating responses.We
propose CARE-RAG (Conflict-Aware and Reliable Evidence for RAG), a novel
framework that improves trustworthiness through Conflict-Driven Summarization
of all available evidence.CARE-RAG first derives parameter-aware evidence by
comparing parameter records to identify diverse internal perspectives. It then
refines retrieved evidences to produce context-aware evidence, removing
irrelevant or misleading content. To detect and summarize conflicts, we distill
a 3B LLaMA3.2 model to perform conflict-driven summarization, enabling reliable
synthesis across multiple sources.To further ensure evaluation integrity, we
introduce a QA Repair step to correct outdated or ambiguous benchmark
answers.Experiments on revised QA datasets with retrieval data show that
CARE-RAG consistently outperforms strong RAG baselines, especially in scenarios
with noisy or conflicting evidence.

*Xinxi Lyu,Michael Duan,Rulin Shao,Pang Wei Koh,Sewon Min*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出CompactDS，一个高质量、多样化的网络规模数据存储，显著提升了检索增强生成（RAG）在推理密集型任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG在推理密集型任务中表现有限，缺乏与预训练数据广度对齐的网络规模数据存储。

Method: 引入CompactDS，结合内存近似最近邻检索和磁盘精确搜索，优化检索速度和召回率。

Result: 在多个基准测试中（MMLU、MMLU Pro、GPQA、MATH），RAG准确性显著提升（相对增益10%-33%）。

Conclusion: CompactDS在保持简单性和自包含性的同时，优于复杂代理RAG系统和搜索引擎，支持未来检索式AI系统研究。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has primarily been studied in limited
settings, such as factoid question answering; more challenging,
reasoning-intensive benchmarks have seen limited success from minimal RAG. In
this work, we challenge this prevailing view on established,
reasoning-intensive benchmarks: MMLU, MMLU Pro, AGI Eval, GPQA, and MATH. We
identify a key missing component in prior work: a usable, web-scale datastore
aligned with the breadth of pretraining data. To this end, we introduce
CompactDS: a diverse, high-quality, web-scale datastore that achieves high
retrieval accuracy and subsecond latency on a single-node. The key insights are
(1) most web content can be filtered out without sacrificing coverage, and a
compact, high-quality subset is sufficient; and (2) combining in-memory
approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) retrieval and on-disk exact search balances
speed and recall. Using CompactDS, we show that a minimal RAG pipeline achieves
consistent accuracy improvements across all benchmarks and model sizes
(8B--70B), with relative gains of 10% on MMLU, 33% on MMLU Pro, 14% on GPQA,
and 19% on MATH. No single data source suffices alone, highlighting the
importance of diversity of sources (web crawls, curated math, academic papers,
textbooks). Finally, we show that our carefully designed in-house datastore
matches or outperforms web search engines such as Google Search, as well as
recently proposed, complex agent-based RAG systems--all while maintaining
simplicity, reproducibility, and self-containment. We release CompactDS and our
retrieval pipeline, supporting future research exploring retrieval-based AI
systems.

### [10] [La RoSA: Enhancing LLM Efficiency via Layerwise Rotated Sparse Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01299)
*Kai Liu,Bowen Xu,Shaoyu Wu,Xin Chen,Hao Zhou,Yongliang Tao,Lulu Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaRoSA是一种新的激活稀疏化方法，通过层间正交旋转和Top-K选择，无需额外训练或基于幅度的剪枝，显著提升LLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么需要耗时的恢复训练，要么依赖基于幅度的剪枝，导致稀疏性波动和推理速度不稳定。LaRoSA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用层间正交旋转将输入激活转换为更适合稀疏化的形式，并通过Top-K选择实现一致的模型级稀疏性。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B上，40%稀疏度下，LaRoSA仅产生0.17困惑度差距，推理速度提升1.30倍，零样本任务准确率差距缩小至0.54%。

Conclusion: LaRoSA是一种高效且稳定的激活稀疏化方法，适用于多种LLM，性能损失小且推理加速显著。

Abstract: Activation sparsity can reduce the computational overhead and memory
transfers during the forward pass of Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
Existing methods face limitations, either demanding time-consuming recovery
training that hinders real-world adoption, or relying on empirical
magnitude-based pruning, which causes fluctuating sparsity and unstable
inference speed-up. This paper introduces LaRoSA (Layerwise Rotated Sparse
Activation), a novel method for activation sparsification designed to improve
LLM efficiency without requiring additional training or magnitude-based
pruning. We leverage layerwise orthogonal rotations to transform input
activations into rotated forms that are more suitable for sparsification. By
employing a Top-K selection approach within the rotated activations, we achieve
consistent model-level sparsity and reliable wall-clock time speed-up. LaRoSA
is effective across various sizes and types of LLMs, demonstrating minimal
performance degradation and robust inference acceleration. Specifically, for
LLaMA2-7B at 40% sparsity, LaRoSA achieves a mere 0.17 perplexity gap with a
consistent 1.30x wall-clock time speed-up, and reduces the accuracy gap in
zero-shot tasks compared to the dense model to just 0.54%, while surpassing
TEAL by 1.77% and CATS by 17.14%.

Abstract: Navigating the complexities of physics reasoning has long been a difficult
task for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring a synthesis of profound
conceptual understanding and adept problem-solving techniques. In this study,
we investigate the application of advanced instruction-tuned reasoning models,
such as Deepseek-R1, to address a diverse spectrum of physics problems curated
from the challenging SciBench benchmark. Our comprehensive experimental
evaluation reveals the remarkable capabilities of reasoning models. Not only do
they achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in answering intricate physics
questions, but they also generate distinctive reasoning patterns that emphasize
on symbolic derivation. Furthermore, our findings indicate that even for these
highly sophisticated reasoning models, the strategic incorporation of few-shot
prompting can still yield measurable improvements in overall accuracy,
highlighting the potential for continued performance gains.

Abstract: We introduce LEDOM, the first purely reverse language model, trained
autoregressively on 435B tokens with 2B and 7B parameter variants, which
processes sequences in reverse temporal order through previous token
prediction. For the first time, we present the reverse language model as a
potential foundational model across general tasks, accompanied by a set of
intriguing examples and insights. Based on LEDOM, we further introduce a novel
application: Reverse Reward, where LEDOM-guided reranking of forward language
model outputs leads to substantial performance improvements on mathematical
reasoning tasks. This approach leverages LEDOM's unique backward reasoning
capability to refine generation quality through posterior evaluation. Our
findings suggest that LEDOM exhibits unique characteristics with broad
application potential. We will release all models, training code, and
pre-training data to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种大规模偏好数据集SynPref-40M和奖励模型Skywork-Reward-V2，通过人机协同的两阶段流程提升数据质量，实现了在多个基准测试中的最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型在捕捉人类偏好方面表现不佳，主要原因是偏好数据集的范围狭窄、标注质量不足或缺乏质量控制。

Method: 设计了一个人机协同的两阶段数据标注流程，结合人类标注质量和AI的可扩展性，并基于SynPref-40M训练了Skywork-Reward-V2系列奖励模型。

Result: Skywork-Reward-V2在七个主要奖励模型基准测试中表现优异，验证了数据规模和高质标注的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过人机协同的数据标注方法，显著提升了奖励模型的性能，展示了现有偏好数据集的潜力。

Abstract: Despite the critical role of reward models (RMs) in reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF), current state-of-the-art open RMs perform poorly on
most existing evaluation benchmarks, failing to capture the spectrum of nuanced
and sophisticated human preferences. Even approaches that incorporate advanced
training techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We
hypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in
preference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or
lack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a
large-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named
SynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic
two-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human
annotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide
verified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation
based on human guidance. Training on this preference mixture, we introduce
Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of eight reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B
parameters, trained on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference
pairs from SynPref-40M. We demonstrate that Skywork-Reward-V2 is versatile
across a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human
preferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and
best-of-N scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven major
reward model benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the effectiveness of our
approach stems not only from data scale but also from high-quality curation.
The Skywork-Reward-V2 series represents substantial progress in open reward
models, highlighting the untapped potential of existing preference datasets and
demonstrating how human-AI curation synergy can unlock significantly higher
data quality.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于注意力机制的深度学习方法，用于电子健康记录文本的信息提取和多标签疾病预测，在MIMIC-IV数据集上验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子健康记录文本的非结构化和高维语义复杂性带来的挑战。

Result: 模型在多种性能指标上优于现有方法，具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为处理真实临床文本提供了高效算法基础，对多标签医学文本建模任务具有实际意义。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges posed by the unstructured nature and
high-dimensional semantic complexity of electronic health record texts. A deep
learning method based on attention mechanisms is proposed to achieve unified
modeling for information extraction and multi-label disease prediction. The
study is conducted on the MIMIC-IV dataset. A Transformer-based architecture is
used to perform representation learning over clinical text. Multi-layer
self-attention mechanisms are employed to capture key medical entities and
their contextual relationships. A Sigmoid-based multi-label classifier is then
applied to predict multiple disease labels. The model incorporates a
context-aware semantic alignment mechanism, enhancing its representational
capacity in typical medical scenarios such as label co-occurrence and sparse
information. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, a series of
experiments were conducted, including baseline comparisons, hyperparameter
sensitivity analysis, data perturbation studies, and noise injection tests.
Results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
representative existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. The
model maintains strong generalization under varying data scales, interference
levels, and model depth configurations. The framework developed in this study
offers an efficient algorithmic foundation for processing real-world clinical
texts and presents practical significance for multi-label medical text modeling

### [15] [LogitSpec: Accelerating Retrieval-based Speculative Decoding via Next Next Token Speculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01449)
*Tianyu Liu,Qitan Lv,Hao Li,Xing Gao,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LogitSpec是一种无需训练、即插即用的方法，通过利用最后一个token的logit推测下一个和下一个token，扩展检索范围以提高检索式推测解码的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决检索式推测解码中难以找到匹配和准确draft tokens的问题。

Method: 利用最后一个token的logit推测下一个和下一个token，并检索相关参考。

Result: 在多个文本生成基准测试中，实现了最高2.61倍的加速和每解码步骤3.28个平均接受token。

Conclusion: LogitSpec显著提升了检索式推测解码的性能，且易于集成到现有LLM推理框架中。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD), where a small draft model is employed to propose
draft tokens in advance and then the target model validates them in parallel,
has emerged as a promising technique for LLM inference acceleration. Many
endeavors to improve SD are to eliminate the need for a draft model and
generate draft tokens in a retrieval-based manner in order to further alleviate
the drafting overhead and significantly reduce the difficulty in deployment and
applications. However, retrieval-based SD relies on a matching paradigm to
retrieval the most relevant reference as the draft tokens, where these methods
often fail to find matched and accurate draft tokens. To address this
challenge, we propose LogitSpec to effectively expand the retrieval range and
find the most relevant reference as drafts. Our LogitSpec is motivated by the
observation that the logit of the last token can not only predict the next
token, but also speculate the next next token. Specifically, LogitSpec
generates draft tokens in two steps: (1) utilizing the last logit to speculate
the next next token; (2) retrieving relevant reference for both the next token
and the next next token. LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which
can be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks. Extensive
experiments on a wide range of text generation benchmarks demonstrate that
LogitSpec can achieve up to 2.61 $\times$ speedup and 3.28 mean accepted tokens
per decoding step. Our code is available at

### [16] [Evaluating the Effectiveness of Direct Preference Optimization for Personalizing German Automatic Text Simplifications for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01479)
*Yingqiang Gao,Kaede Johnson,David Froehlich,Luisa Carrer,Sarah Ebling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于直接偏好优化（DPO）的个性化文本简化方法，通过结合目标群体的反馈优化LLM模型，提升文本简化的个性化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本简化系统缺乏目标群体的偏好反馈，导致个性化不足，无法满足特定需求。

Method: 扩展了监督微调（SFT）方法，引入DPO技术，结合目标群体的偏好数据对模型进行后训练。

Result: 研究强调了目标群体参与设计个性化AI解决方案的必要性，并提出了一个开发个性化ATS系统的完整流程。

Conclusion: 该工作为个性化包容性AI系统的发展提供了方向，强调了目标群体直接参与的重要性。

Abstract: Automatic text simplification (ATS) aims to enhance language accessibility
for various target groups, particularly persons with intellectual disabilities.
Recent advancements in generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs),
have substantially improved the quality of machine-generated text
simplifications, thereby mitigating information barriers for the target group.
However, existing LLM-based ATS systems do not incorporate preference feedback
on text simplifications during training, resulting in a lack of personalization
tailored to the specific needs of target group representatives.
  In this work, we extend the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach
for adapting LLM-based ATS models by leveraging a computationally efficient LLM
alignment technique -- direct preference optimization (DPO). Specifically, we
post-train LLM-based ATS models using human feedback collected from persons
with intellectual disabilities, reflecting their preferences on paired text
simplifications generated by mainstream LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a
pipeline for developing personalized LLM-based ATS systems, encompassing data
collection, model selection, SFT and DPO post-training, and evaluation. Our
findings underscore the necessity of active participation of target group
persons in designing personalized AI accessibility solutions aligned with human
expectations. This work represents a step towards personalizing inclusive AI
systems at the target-group level, incorporating insights not only from text
simplification experts but also from target group persons themselves.

*Álvaro Zaera,Diana Nicoleta Popa,Ivan Sekulic,Paolo Rosso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合不确定性建模和微调大语言模型（LLM）的模块化框架，用于高效准确地检测任务导向对话系统中的超出范围（OOS）意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决任务导向对话系统中对未知和模糊查询的鲁棒性问题，提升OOS意图检测的效率和准确性。

Method: 分两步：首先对现有分类器进行不确定性估计，然后对高不确定性实例触发微调的LLM进行最终决策。

Result: 在关键OOS检测基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，包括来自实际部署系统的真实数据。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和性能之间取得了平衡，结合传统方法和LLM，为OOS检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-scope (OOS) intent detection is a critical challenge in task-oriented
dialogue systems (TODS), as it ensures robustness to unseen and ambiguous
queries. In this work, we propose a novel but simple modular framework that
combines uncertainty modeling with fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) for
efficient and accurate OOS detection. The first step applies uncertainty
estimation to the output of an in-scope intent detection classifier, which is
currently deployed in a real-world TODS handling tens of thousands of user
interactions daily. The second step then leverages an emerging LLM-based
approach, where a fine-tuned LLM is triggered to make a final decision on
instances with high uncertainty. Unlike prior approaches, our method
effectively balances computational efficiency and performance, combining
traditional approaches with LLMs and yielding state-of-the-art results on key
OOS detection benchmarks, including real-world OOS data acquired from a
deployed TODS.

### [18] [Is External Information Useful for Stance Detection with LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01543)
*Quang Minh Nguyen,Taegyoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在立场检测任务中，外部信息（如维基百科和网络搜索）对大型语言模型（LLMs）的性能产生负面影响，导致F1分数下降高达27.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索外部信息（如维基百科和网络搜索）是否能够提升LLMs在立场检测任务中的性能，尽管此前研究表明外部信息对BERT等模型有益。

Method: 系统评估了八种LLMs在三个数据集和12个目标上的表现，分析了外部信息对立场检测的影响。

Result: 外部信息在大多数情况下降低了LLMs的性能，且LLMs倾向于根据提供的信息而非文本的真实立场进行预测。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在立场检测任务中对外部信息的敏感性，强调了信息偏见对LLM性能的潜在风险。

Abstract: In the stance detection task, a text is classified as either favorable,
opposing, or neutral towards a target. Prior work suggests that the use of
external information, e.g., excerpts from Wikipedia, improves stance detection
performance. However, whether or not such information can benefit large
language models (LLMs) remains an unanswered question, despite their wide
adoption in many reasoning tasks. In this study, we conduct a systematic
evaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect
stance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets.
Surprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases,
with macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\%. We explain this through
experiments showing LLMs' tendency to align their predictions with the stance
and sentiment of the provided information rather than the ground truth stance
of the given text. We also find that performance degradation persists with
chain-of-thought prompting, while fine-tuning mitigates but does not fully
eliminate it. Our findings, in contrast to previous literature on BERT-based
systems which suggests that external information enhances performance,
highlight the risks of information biases in LLM-based stance classifiers. Code

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的任务导向对话系统LUSTER，结合端到端强化学习，优化任务成功率和情感响应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型提升了语言流畅性和上下文理解，但构建高效且情感智能的任务导向对话系统仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出LUSTER系统，结合LLM能力和结构化奖励模型，通过短（用户情感）长（任务成功）期奖励进行端到端强化学习。

Result: 实验表明，结合LLM和结构化奖励模型能提升系统的韧性和情感响应能力。

Conclusion: LUSTER为下一代对话系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems are designed to help users achieve
specific goals through natural language interaction. While recent advances in
large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved linguistic fluency and
contextual understanding, building effective and emotionally intelligent ToD
systems remains a complex challenge. Effective ToD systems must optimise for
task success, emotional understanding and responsiveness, and precise
information conveyance, all within inherently noisy and ambiguous
conversational environments. In this work, we investigate architectural,
representational, optimisational as well as emotional considerations of ToD
systems. We set up systems covering these design considerations with a
challenging evaluation environment composed of a natural-language user
simulator coupled with an imperfect natural language understanding module. We
propose \textbf{LUSTER}, an \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{U}nified \textbf{S}ystem
for \textbf{T}ask-oriented dialogue with \textbf{E}nd-to-end
\textbf{R}einforcement learning with both short-term (user sentiment) and
long-term (task success) rewards. Our findings demonstrate that combining LLM
capability with structured reward modelling leads to more resilient and
emotionally responsive ToD systems, offering a practical path forward for
next-generation conversational agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着指令调优神经语言模型的发展，NLP评估逐渐从全局评分转向成对比较排行榜，需要研究两者的优劣以指导评估策略选择。

Method: 通过合成和真实数据集的计算实验，使用标准全局指标和Bradley-Terry模型进行成对比较。

Result: 全局评分提供更可靠的总体排名，但可能低估某些模型；成对比较能有效识别低分模型中的强者，但收敛需要更多比较。

Conclusion: 建议根据评估需求选择方法，全局评分适合总体排名，成对比较适合特定场景（如文本生成）。

Abstract: With the advent of highly capable instruction-tuned neural language models,
benchmarking in natural language processing (NLP) is increasingly shifting
towards pairwise comparison leaderboards, such as LMSYS Arena, from traditional
global pointwise scores (e.g., GLUE, BIG-bench, SWE-bench). This paper
empirically investigates the strengths and weaknesses of both global scores and
pairwise comparisons to aid decision-making in selecting appropriate model
evaluation strategies. Through computational experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets using standard global metrics and the popular Bradley-Terry
model for pairwise comparisons, we found that while global scores provide more
reliable overall rankings, they can underestimate strong models with rare,
significant errors or low confidence. Conversely, pairwise comparisons are
particularly effective for identifying strong contenders among models with
lower global scores, especially where quality metrics are hard to define (e.g.,
text generation), though they require more comparisons to converge if ties are
frequent. Our code and data are available at

Motivation: 探讨预训练语言模型在低资源印尼本土语言中的迁移能力，以解决资源匮乏问题。

Method: 评估零样本和适配器迁移方法，使用印尼BERT、mBERT、XLM-R和MAD-X，将目标语言分为已见、部分已见和未见三类。

Result: 多语言模型在已见语言上表现最佳，MAD-X显著提升性能；语言模型的先前接触是迁移成功的关键。

Conclusion: MAD-X适配器是有效的迁移方法，语言模型的先前接触对迁移性能至关重要。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transferability of pre-trained language
models to low-resource Indonesian local languages through the task of sentiment
analysis. We evaluate both zero-shot performance and adapter-based transfer on
ten local languages using models of different types: a monolingual Indonesian
BERT, multilingual models such as mBERT and XLM-R, and a modular adapter-based
approach called MAD-X. To better understand model behavior, we group the target
languages into three categories: seen (included during pre-training), partially
seen (not included but linguistically related to seen languages), and unseen
(absent and unrelated in pre-training data). Our results reveal clear
performance disparities across these groups: multilingual models perform best
on seen languages, moderately on partially seen ones, and poorly on unseen
languages. We find that MAD-X significantly improves performance, especially
for seen and partially seen languages, without requiring labeled data in the
target language. Additionally, we conduct a further analysis on tokenization
and show that while subword fragmentation and vocabulary overlap with
Indonesian correlate weakly with prediction quality, they do not fully explain
the observed performance. Instead, the most consistent predictor of transfer
success is the model's prior exposure to the language, either directly or
through a related language.

Motivation: 现有基于静态数据集的评估方法无法适应模因的动态演变，需要更灵活、全面的评估框架。

Result: 实验表明AdamMeme能系统揭示不同模型的性能差异，提供细粒度分析。

Conclusion: AdamMeme为多模态大语言模型的评估提供了动态、全面的解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal memes in the social media era demands that
multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) effectively understand meme
harmfulness. Existing benchmarks for assessing mLLMs on harmful meme
understanding rely on accuracy-based, model-agnostic evaluations using static
datasets. These benchmarks are limited in their ability to provide up-to-date
and thorough assessments, as online memes evolve dynamically. To address this,
we propose AdamMeme, a flexible, agent-based evaluation framework that
adaptively probes the reasoning capabilities of mLLMs in deciphering meme
harmfulness. Through multi-agent collaboration, AdamMeme provides comprehensive
evaluations by iteratively updating the meme data with challenging samples,
thereby exposing specific limitations in how mLLMs interpret harmfulness.
Extensive experiments show that our framework systematically reveals the
varying performance of different target mLLMs, offering in-depth, fine-grained
analyses of model-specific weaknesses. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种联合学习偏见和刻板印象检测的方法，并引入StereoBias数据集，实验表明联合训练能显著提升偏见检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型中的偏见和刻板印象问题，尤其是在敏感领域（如内容审核和决策）中的潜在危害。

Method: 使用StereoBias数据集，比较编码器模型和解码器模型（通过QLoRA微调），并探索联合训练偏见和刻板印象检测的效果。

Result: 联合训练显著提升了偏见检测效果，且解码器模型表现具有竞争力。实验还表明改进源于偏见与刻板印象的关联，而非多任务学习本身。

Conclusion: 利用刻板印象信息可以构建更公平、更有效的AI系统。

Abstract: Bias and stereotypes in language models can cause harm, especially in
sensitive areas like content moderation and decision-making. This paper
addresses bias and stereotype detection by exploring how jointly learning these
tasks enhances model performance. We introduce StereoBias, a unique dataset
labeled for bias and stereotype detection across five categories: religion,
gender, socio-economic status, race, profession, and others, enabling a deeper
study of their relationship. Our experiments compare encoder-only models and
fine-tuned decoder-only models using QLoRA. While encoder-only models perform
well, decoder-only models also show competitive results. Crucially, joint
training on bias and stereotype detection significantly improves bias detection
compared to training them separately. Additional experiments with sentiment
analysis confirm that the improvements stem from the connection between bias
and stereotypes, not multi-task learning alone. These findings highlight the
value of leveraging stereotype information to build fairer and more effective
AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律工作的文本密集性和资源密集性为NLP研究提供了独特挑战与机会，但现有数据驱动方法缺乏可解释性和可信度，限制了其在动态法律环境中的应用。

Method: 与法律专家合作扩展数据集，利用LLMs和上下文学习评估合同条款的合法性，比较不同法律上下文（无上下文、完整法律文本、精简版法律指南）对模型性能的影响。

Result: 完整法律文本对性能有中等提升，而精简版法律指南显著提高了无效条款的召回率和加权F1分数（达80%），但LLMs表现仍远低于人类律师。

Conclusion: LLMs在合同合法性审查中具有辅助潜力，但现有方法仍有局限性，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Legal work, characterized by its text-heavy and resource-intensive nature,
presents unique challenges and opportunities for NLP research. While
data-driven approaches have advanced the field, their lack of interpretability
and trustworthiness limits their applicability in dynamic legal environments.
To address these issues, we collaborated with legal experts to extend an
existing dataset and explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
in-context learning to evaluate the legality of clauses in German employment
contracts. Our work evaluates the ability of different LLMs to classify clauses
as "valid," "unfair," or "void" under three legal context variants: no legal
context, full-text sources of laws and court rulings, and distilled versions of
these (referred to as examination guidelines). Results show that full-text
sources moderately improve performance, while examination guidelines
significantly enhance recall for void clauses and weighted F1-Score, reaching
80\%. Despite these advancements, LLMs' performance when using full-text
sources remains substantially below that of human lawyers. We contribute an
extended dataset, including examination guidelines, referenced legal sources,
and corresponding annotations, alongside our code and all log files. Our
findings highlight the potential of LLMs to assist lawyers in contract legality
review while also underscoring the limitations of the methods presented.

Abstract: Tokenisation - "the process of splitting text into atomic parts" (Brezina &
Timperley, 2017: 1) - is a crucial step for corpus linguistics, as it provides
the basis for any applicable quantitative method (e.g. collocations) while
ensuring the reliability of qualitative approaches. This paper examines how
discrepancies in tokenisation affect the representation of language data and
the validity of analytical findings: investigating the challenges posed by
emojis and homoglyphs, the study highlights the necessity of preprocessing
these elements to maintain corpus fidelity to the source data. The research
presents methods for ensuring that digital texts are accurately represented in
corpora, thereby supporting reliable linguistic analysis and guaranteeing the
repeatability of linguistic interpretations. The findings emphasise the
necessity of a detailed understanding of both linguistic and technical aspects
involved in digital textual data to enhance the accuracy of corpus analysis,

Result: 在1.2B参数的LLaMA模型上，MuRating显著提升了英语和多语言任务的准确性，尤其在知识密集型任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: MuRating为多语言数据质量评估提供了有效解决方案，并指出了翻译保真度和叙事材料不足等未来研究方向。

Abstract: Data quality is a critical driver of large language model performance, yet
existing model-based selection methods focus almost exclusively on English. We
introduce MuRating, a scalable framework that transfers high-quality English
data-quality signals into a single rater for 17 target languages. MuRating
aggregates multiple English "raters" via pairwise comparisons to learn unified
document-quality scores,then projects these judgments through translation to
train a multilingual evaluator on monolingual, cross-lingual, and parallel text
pairs. Applied to web data, MuRating selects balanced subsets of English and
multilingual content to pretrain a 1.2 B-parameter LLaMA model. Compared to
strong baselines, including QuRater, AskLLM, DCLM and so on, our approach
boosts average accuracy on both English benchmarks and multilingual
evaluations, with especially large gains on knowledge-intensive tasks. We
further analyze translation fidelity, selection biases, and underrepresentation
of narrative material, outlining directions for future work.

Result: 模型能区分评估与部署提示，且当前安全评估被模型视为不真实。

Conclusion: 需确保评估的可信度，并利用模型内部信息支持黑盒安全审计。

Abstract: Language models can distinguish between testing and deployment phases -- a
capability known as evaluation awareness. This has significant safety and
policy implications, potentially undermining the reliability of evaluations
that are central to AI governance frameworks and voluntary industry
commitments. In this paper, we study evaluation awareness in
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We show that linear probes can separate real-world
evaluation and deployment prompts, suggesting that current models internally
represent this distinction. We also find that current safety evaluations are
correctly classified by the probes, suggesting that they already appear
artificial or inauthentic to models. Our findings underscore the importance of
ensuring trustworthy evaluations and understanding deceptive capabilities. More
broadly, our work showcases how model internals may be leveraged to support
blackbox methods in safety audits, especially for future models more competent
at evaluation awareness and deception.

Motivation: 理解多模态模型在输入信息冲突时的行为及其内部机制。

Method: 通过提供冲突的视觉-语言输入（如图像与标题不符），测试模型对不同模态的偏好，并分析其内部结构和注意力机制。

Result: 模型倾向于偏好某一模态，且特定注意力头可调整这种偏好；还发现模态无关的“路由头”可提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究为识别和控制多模态模型在冲突信号下的行为提供了关键步骤。

Abstract: AI models are increasingly required to be multimodal, integrating disparate
input streams into a coherent state representation on which subsequent
behaviors and actions can be based. This paper seeks to understand how such
models behave when input streams present conflicting information. Focusing
specifically on vision-language models, we provide inconsistent inputs (e.g.,
an image of a dog paired with the caption "A photo of a cat") and ask the model
to report the information present in one of the specific modalities (e.g.,
"What does the caption say / What is in the image?"). We find that models often
favor one modality over the other, e.g., reporting the image regardless of what
the caption says, but that different models differ in which modality they
favor. We find evidence that the behaviorally preferred modality is evident in
the internal representational structure of the model, and that specific
attention heads can restructure the representations to favor one modality over
the other. Moreover, we find modality-agnostic "router heads" which appear to
promote answers about the modality requested in the instruction, and which can
be manipulated or transferred in order to improve performance across datasets
and modalities. Together, the work provides essential steps towards identifying
and controlling if and how models detect and resolve conflicting signals within
complex multimodal environments.

Conclusion: 基于研究结果，提出了开发和评估可解释医疗编码系统的建议。

Abstract: Automatic medical coding has the potential to ease documentation and billing
processes. For this task, transparency plays an important role for medical
coders and regulatory bodies, which can be achieved using explainability
methods. However, the evaluation of these approaches has been mostly limited to
short text and binary settings due to a scarcity of annotated data. Recent
efforts by Cheng et al. (2023) have introduced the MDACE dataset, which
provides a valuable resource containing code evidence in clinical records. In
this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the MDACE dataset and perform
plausibility evaluation of current explainable medical coding systems from an
applied perspective. With this, we contribute to a deeper understanding of
automatic medical coding and evidence extraction. Our findings reveal that
ground truth evidence aligns with code descriptions to a certain degree. An
investigation into state-of-the-art approaches shows a high overlap with ground
truth evidence. We propose match measures and highlight success and failure
cases. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for developing and
evaluating explainable medical coding systems.

TL;DR: 比较分析小型语言模型生成的临床笔记结构化输出的可解析性，发现JSON格式表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为隐私敏感的临床环境中部署语言模型提供实用的格式选择和提示设计指导。

Method: 评估JSON、YAML和XML三种序列化格式的可解析性，分析目标提示和模型大小的影响。

Result: JSON格式表现最好，结构鲁棒性随目标提示和更大模型提升，但对长文档和特定笔记类型下降。

Conclusion: JSON是最佳选择，需注意文档长度和笔记类型对解析的影响。

Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of the parseability of structured outputs
generated by small language models for open attribute-value extraction from
clinical notes. We evaluate three widely used serialization formats: JSON,
YAML, and XML, and find that JSON consistently yields the highest parseability.
Structural robustness improves with targeted prompting and larger models, but
declines for longer documents and certain note types. Our error analysis
identifies recurring format-specific failure patterns. These findings offer
practical guidance for selecting serialization formats and designing prompts
when deploying language models in privacy-sensitive clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种系统性方法，通过分析低困惑度序列（模型生成的高概率文本片段）来探索LLMs如何利用和复制训练数据，并追踪其来源。研究发现部分序列无法映射到训练数据，而对可映射的部分则量化了其在源文档中的分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs如何利用训练数据对透明度、问责制、隐私和公平性至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种分析低困惑度序列的系统性方法，包括提取、追踪来源及量化分布。

Result: 发现大量低困惑度序列无法映射到训练数据，而对可映射的部分量化了其在源文档中的分布。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解LLMs训练数据如何影响其行为提供了新途径。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly widespread, understanding
how specific training data shapes their outputs is crucial for transparency,
accountability, privacy, and fairness. To explore how LLMs leverage and
replicate their training data, we introduce a systematic approach centered on
analyzing low-perplexity sequences - high-probability text spans generated by
the model. Our pipeline reliably extracts such long sequences across diverse
topics while avoiding degeneration, then traces them back to their sources in
the training data. Surprisingly, we find that a substantial portion of these
low-perplexity spans cannot be mapped to the corpus. For those that do match,
we quantify the distribution of occurrences across source documents,
highlighting the scope and nature of verbatim recall and paving a way toward
better understanding of how LLMs training data impacts their behavior.

TL;DR: DIY-MKG是一个开源系统，支持多语言学习，通过个性化词汇知识图谱和自适应复习模块解决现有工具的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言学习工具在多语言词汇联系、个性化学习和认知卸载方面存在不足。

Method: 设计DIY-MKG系统，利用LLM构建个性化词汇知识图谱，支持动态生成测验和用户反馈。

Result: 评估显示词汇扩展可靠且公平，生成的测验准确度高。

Conclusion: DIY-MKG在多语言学习中表现出色，验证了其稳健性。

Abstract: Existing language learning tools, even those powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs), often lack support for polyglot learners to build linguistic
connections across vocabularies in multiple languages, provide limited
customization for individual learning paces or needs, and suffer from
detrimental cognitive offloading. To address these limitations, we design
Do-It-Yourself Multilingual Knowledge Graph (DIY-MKG), an open-source system
that supports polyglot language learning. DIY-MKG allows the user to build
personalized vocabulary knowledge graphs, which are constructed by selective
expansion with related words suggested by an LLM. The system further enhances
learning through rich annotation capabilities and an adaptive review module
that leverages LLMs for dynamic, personalized quiz generation. In addition,
DIY-MKG allows users to flag incorrect quiz questions, simultaneously
increasing user engagement and providing a feedback loop for prompt refinement.
Our evaluation of LLM-based components in DIY-MKG shows that vocabulary
expansion is reliable and fair across multiple languages, and that the
generated quizzes are highly accurate, validating the robustness of DIY-MKG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiCoTA框架通过中间大小模型作为教师助手，提升小语言模型的长链推理能力，实验显示性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小语言模型（SLMs）因容量限制难以学习长链推理（CoT）的问题，即“SLMs Learnability Gap”。

Method: 引入MiCoTA框架，利用中间大小模型和中间长度CoT序列，弥合容量和推理长度差距。

Result: 实验表明，MiCoTA显著提升SLMs推理性能，如Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct在多个基准测试中平均得分分别提高3.47和3.93。

Conclusion: MiCoTA通过更接近SLM分布的数据生成机制，为未来长链CoT数据蒸馏研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks requiring long thought
sequences for planning, reflection, and refinement. However, their substantial
model size and high computational demands are impractical for widespread
deployment. Yet, small language models (SLMs) often struggle to learn long-form
CoT reasoning due to their limited capacity, a phenomenon we refer to as the
"SLMs Learnability Gap". To address this, we introduce
\textbf{Mi}d-\textbf{Co}T \textbf{T}eacher \textbf{A}ssistant Distillation
(MiCoTAl), a framework for improving long CoT distillation for SLMs. MiCoTA
employs intermediate-sized models as teacher assistants and utilizes
intermediate-length CoT sequences to bridge both the capacity and reasoning
length gaps. Our experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate that although SLMs
distilled from large teachers can perform poorly, by applying MiCoTA, they
achieve significant improvements in reasoning performance. Specifically,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct achieve an improvement of 3.47 and
3.93 respectively on average score on AIME2024, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500 and
GSM8K benchmarks. To better understand the mechanism behind MiCoTA, we perform
a quantitative experiment demonstrating that our method produces data more
closely aligned with base SLM distributions. Our insights pave the way for
future research into long-CoT data distillation for SLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法忽视注意力头在网络中的位置，导致性能下降。

Method: 策略性剪枝高层注意力头，并引入自适应重缩放参数。

Result: 在27个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在生成任务中显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了剪枝后模型的性能，尤其在生成任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Pruning is a highly effective approach for compressing large language models
(LLMs), significantly reducing inference latency. However, conventional
training-free structured pruning methods often employ a heuristic metric that
indiscriminately removes some attention heads across all pruning layers,
without considering their positions within the network architecture. In this
work, we propose a novel pruning algorithm that strategically prunes attention
heads in the model's higher layers. Since the removal of attention heads can
alter the magnitude of token representations, we introduce an adaptive
rescaling parameter that calibrates the representation scale post-pruning to
counteract this effect. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of
LLMs, including LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B-v0.3, Qwen2-7B, and Gemma2-9B. Our
evaluation includes both generation and discriminative tasks across 27
datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing structured pruning methods. This improvement is particularly notable
in generation tasks, where our approach significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large
language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in complex domains such as logical reasoning and
experimental coding. Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have
explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the
context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop
systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of
scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive
survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our
understanding and impedes further development in this field. To address this
gap, we present a comprehensive survey and offer a unified perspective on
AI4Research. Specifically, the main contributions of our work are as follows:
(1) Systematic taxonomy: We first introduce a systematic taxonomy to classify
five mainstream tasks in AI4Research. (2) New frontiers: Then, we identify key
research gaps and highlight promising future directions, focusing on the rigor
and scalability of automated experiments, as well as the societal impact. (3)
Abundant applications and resources: Finally, we compile a wealth of resources,
including relevant multidisciplinary applications, data corpora, and tools. We
hope our work will provide the research community with quick access to these
resources and stimulate innovative breakthroughs in AI4Research.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLM）与多样化且可能冲突的人类偏好对齐的挑战。

Method: 提出GAPO和P-GAPO，采用多梯度下降自适应调整梯度，平衡目标间的权衡。

Result: GAPO在Mistral-7B上表现优于现有方法，在帮助性和无害性上均取得更好效果。

Conclusion: GAPO能有效收敛至Pareto最优解，为LLM与多样化偏好对齐提供新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful
technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, effectively aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences remains a
significant challenge, particularly when they are conflict. To address this
issue, we frame human value alignment as a multi-objective optimization
problem, aiming to maximize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. We
introduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning
paradigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse
preference distributions. GAPO adaptively rescales the gradients for each
objective to determine an update direction that optimally balances the
trade-offs between objectives. Additionally, we introduce P-GAPO, which
incorporates user preferences across different objectives and achieves Pareto
solutions that better align with the user's specific needs. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that GAPO converges towards a Pareto optimal solution for
multiple objectives. Empirical results on Mistral-7B show that GAPO outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both
helpfulness and harmlessness.

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何通过从教师模型中蒸馏高质量推理轨迹（NaturalThoughts）来提升学生模型的推理能力，发现选择需要多样化推理策略的困难样本更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明，通过监督微调从教师模型蒸馏推理轨迹优于单独使用学生模型的强化学习，但缺乏对何种推理演示最有效的系统性研究。

Method: 通过从NaturalReasoning问题池中筛选高质量推理轨迹（NaturalThoughts），分析影响推理能力蒸馏的因素，如样本效率和可扩展性。

Result: 发现随机采样扩大数据规模是强基线，而选择需要多样化推理策略的困难样本更高效。NaturalThoughts在多个基准测试中优于现有推理数据集。

Conclusion: NaturalThoughts能有效提升学生模型的推理能力，尤其在多样化推理任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that distilling reasoning traces from a larger teacher
model via supervised finetuning outperforms reinforcement learning with the
smaller student model alone (Guo et al. 2025). However, there has not been a
systematic study of what kind of reasoning demonstrations from the teacher are
most effective in improving the student model's reasoning capabilities. In this
work we curate high-quality "NaturalThoughts" by selecting reasoning traces
from a strong teacher model based on a large pool of questions from
NaturalReasoning (Yuan et al. 2025). We first conduct a systematic analysis of
factors that affect distilling reasoning capabilities, in terms of sample
efficiency and scalability for general reasoning tasks. We observe that simply
scaling up data size with random sampling is a strong baseline with steady
performance gains. Further, we find that selecting difficult examples that
require more diverse reasoning strategies is more sample-efficient to transfer
the teacher model's reasoning skills. Evaluated on both Llama and Qwen models,
training with NaturalThoughts outperforms existing reasoning datasets such as
OpenThoughts, LIMO, etc. on general STEM reasoning benchmarks including
GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-Pro and SuperGPQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自然语言生成（NLG）的内在评估方法（如n-gram重叠或句子合理性）与实际决策效果相关性较弱，需要更直接的评估方式。

Method: 提出决策导向的评估框架，通过市场摘要文本（如晨报摘要和收盘分析）测试人类投资者和LLM代理的决策质量。

Result: 人类和LLM代理仅依赖摘要时表现不优于随机水平，但结合更丰富的分析评论后，人机协作团队显著优于单独的人类或代理基线。

Conclusion: 强调评估生成文本应关注其促进人机协同决策的能力，传统内在评估指标存在局限性。

Abstract: Natural language generation (NLG) is increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains, yet common intrinsic evaluation methods, such as n-gram overlap or
sentence plausibility, weakly correlate with actual decision-making efficacy.
We propose a decision-oriented framework for evaluating generated text by
directly measuring its influence on human and large language model (LLM)
decision outcomes. Using market digest texts--including objective morning
summaries and subjective closing-bell analyses--as test cases, we assess
decision quality based on the financial performance of trades executed by human
investors and autonomous LLM agents informed exclusively by these texts. Our
findings reveal that neither humans nor LLM agents consistently surpass random
performance when relying solely on summaries. However, richer analytical
commentaries enable collaborative human-LLM teams to outperform individual
human or agent baselines significantly. Our approach underscores the importance
of evaluating generated text by its ability to facilitate synergistic
decision-making between humans and LLMs, highlighting critical limitations of
traditional intrinsic metrics.

Wav2Vec-BERT on Bangla, a low-resource language. We have conducted experiments
using two publicly available datasets: Mozilla Common Voice-17 and OpenSLR to

optimization, including learning rate, epochs, and model checkpoint selection,
we have compared the models based on Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error

outperformed Whisper across all key evaluation metrics, demonstrated superior
performance while requiring fewer computational resources, and offered valuable
insights to develop robust speech recognition systems in low-resource

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在辩论中的表现及其对对话结构和语用背景的理解能力。

Method: 通过测试LLMs维持辩论的能力，并衡量其与对话结构和语用背景理解的关系。

Result: LLMs能进行连贯辩论并影响参与者观点，但对深层对话结构理解不足。

Conclusion: LLMs作为评估者的局限性源于其语境理解能力的不足，辩论效果不依赖于对话题的深层理解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are excellent at maintaining high-level,
convincing dialogues. They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators
in sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This,
along with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a
closer examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we
begin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet
most complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability
relates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their
comprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that
LLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the
beliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or
suspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the
arguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures
of dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings
tie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand
the context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that,
if an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to
know what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and
coherence are secondary to effectiveness.

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人数据集中，生成更稳定、空间对齐的视频预测，支持机器人末端执行器轨迹恢复。

Conclusion: 该方法在机器人操作和新视角泛化方面表现出色，为动态场景预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the dynamics of the physical world can enhance a
robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While
recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic
scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically
consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address
this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D
consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap
alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to
learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future
video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D
observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing
baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned
predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We
further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot
end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting
robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.

Conclusion: cp_measure支持可重复、自动化的图像分析流程，适用于计算生物学中的机器学习应用。

Abstract: Biological image analysis has traditionally focused on measuring specific
visual properties of interest for cells or other entities. A complementary
paradigm gaining increasing traction is image-based profiling - quantifying
many distinct visual features to form comprehensive profiles which may reveal
hidden patterns in cellular states, drug responses, and disease mechanisms.
While current tools like CellProfiler can generate these feature sets, they
pose significant barriers to automated and reproducible analyses, hindering
machine learning workflows. Here we introduce cp_measure, a Python library that
extracts CellProfiler's core measurement capabilities into a modular, API-first
tool designed for programmatic feature extraction. We demonstrate that
cp_measure features retain high fidelity with CellProfiler features while
enabling seamless integration with the scientific Python ecosystem. Through
applications to 3D astrocyte imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we showcase
how cp_measure enables reproducible, automated image-based profiling pipelines
that scale effectively for machine learning applications in computational
biology.

(SOD) on resource-constrained devices with real-time performance. While recent
advances in deep neural networks have improved SOD, existing top-leading models
are computationally expensive. We propose an efficient network design that
combines traditional wisdom on SOD and the representation power of modern CNNs.
Like biologically-inspired classical SOD methods relying on computing contrast
cues to determine saliency of image regions, our model leverages Pixel
Difference Convolutions (PDCs) to encode the feature contrasts. Differently,
PDCs are incorporated in a CNN architecture so that the valuable contrast cues
are extracted from rich feature maps. For efficiency, we introduce a difference
convolution reparameterization (DCR) strategy that embeds PDCs into standard
convolutions, eliminating computation and parameters at inference.
Additionally, we introduce SpatioTemporal Difference Convolution (STDC) for
video SOD, enhancing the standard 3D convolution with spatiotemporal contrast
capture. Our models, SDNet for image SOD and STDNet for video SOD, achieve
significant improvements in efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. On a Jetson Orin
device, our models with $<$ 1M parameters operate at 46 FPS and 150 FPS on
streamed images and videos, surpassing the second-best lightweight models in
our experiments by more than $2\times$ and $3\times$ in speed with superior
accuracy. Code will be available at https://github.com/hellozhuo/stdnet.git.

Motivation: 多模态MRI数据在脑肿瘤分割中至关重要，但实际应用中常因图像质量、协议不一致等问题导致某些模态缺失，传统方法难以应对。

Method: 采用单模态并行处理框架，结合Holder散度和互信息，动态调整网络参数以保持模态特征，并使用基于差异和信息的损失函数量化预测与真实标签的差异。

Result: 在BraTS 2018和2020数据集上的实验表明，该方法在模态缺失情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效处理多模态MRI数据缺失问题，显著提升分割准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal MRI provides critical complementary information for accurate brain
tumor segmentation. However, conventional methods struggle when certain
modalities are missing due to issues such as image quality, protocol
inconsistencies, patient allergies, or financial constraints. To address this,
we propose a robust single-modality parallel processing framework that achieves
high segmentation accuracy even with incomplete modalities. Leveraging Holder
divergence and mutual information, our model maintains modality-specific
features while dynamically adjusting network parameters based on the available
inputs. By using these divergence- and information-based loss functions, the
framework effectively quantifies discrepancies between predictions and
ground-truth labels, resulting in consistently accurate segmentation. Extensive
evaluations on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets demonstrate superior
performance over existing methods in handling missing modalities.

Motivation: 现有AI生成视频评估指标仅提供数值评分，缺乏解释性，难以与人类评价对齐。

Method: 引入AIGVE-MACS，利用AIGVE-BENCH 2基准数据集，结合视觉语言模型、加权损失和动态帧采样策略。

Conclusion: AIGVE-MACS为AI生成视频评估提供了全面且与人类对齐的新范式。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated video models has created a pressing
need for robust and interpretable evaluation frameworks. Existing metrics are
limited to producing numerical scores without explanatory comments, resulting
in low interpretability and human evaluation alignment. To address those
challenges, we introduce AIGVE-MACS, a unified model for AI-Generated Video
Evaluation(AIGVE), which can provide not only numerical scores but also
multi-aspect language comment feedback in evaluating these generated videos.
Central to our approach is AIGVE-BENCH 2, a large-scale benchmark comprising
2,500 AI-generated videos and 22,500 human-annotated detailed comments and
numerical scores across nine critical evaluation aspects. Leveraging
AIGVE-BENCH 2, AIGVE-MACS incorporates recent Vision-Language Models with a
novel token-wise weighted loss and a dynamic frame sampling strategy to better
align with human evaluators. Comprehensive experiments across supervised and
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that AIGVE-MACS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both scoring correlation and comment quality, significantly
outperforming prior baselines including GPT-4o and VideoScore. In addition, we
further showcase a multi-agent refinement framework where feedback from
AIGVE-MACS drives iterative improvements in video generation, leading to 53.5%
quality enhancement. This work establishes a new paradigm for comprehensive,
human-aligned evaluation of AI-generated videos. We release the AIGVE-BENCH 2
and AIGVE-MACS at https://huggingface.co/xiaoliux/AIGVE-MACS.

Conclusion: 本文为未来杂草管理系统的开发提供了高效、可扩展和可持续的指导。

Abstract: Weed mapping plays a critical role in precision management by providing
accurate and timely data on weed distribution, enabling targeted control and
reduced herbicide use. This minimizes environmental impacts, supports
sustainable land management, and improves outcomes across agricultural and
natural environments. Recent advances in weed mapping leverage ground-vehicle
Red Green Blue (RGB) cameras, satellite and drone-based remote sensing combined
with sensors such as spectral, Near Infra-Red (NIR), and thermal cameras. The
resulting data are processed using advanced techniques including big data
analytics and machine learning, significantly improving the spatial and
temporal resolution of weed maps and enabling site-specific management
decisions. Despite a growing body of research in this domain, there is a lack
of comprehensive literature reviews specifically focused on weed mapping. In
particular, the absence of a structured analysis spanning the entire mapping
pipeline, from data acquisition to processing techniques and mapping tools,
limits progress in the field. This review addresses these gaps by
systematically examining state-of-the-art methods in data acquisition (sensor
and platform technologies), data processing (including annotation and
modelling), and mapping techniques (such as spatiotemporal analysis and
decision support tools). Following PRISMA guidelines, we critically evaluate
and synthesize key findings from the literature to provide a holistic
understanding of the weed mapping landscape. This review serves as a
foundational reference to guide future research and support the development of
efficient, scalable, and sustainable weed management systems.

Motivation: 现有基于对比学习的方法引入了与雾无关的内容信息，且忽略了频域中的雾相关特性。

Method: 利用扩散模型从频域角度重建图像，提出振幅残差编码器（ARE）补偿振幅差异，相位校正模块（PCM）消除伪影。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 频域扩散模型有效解决了无配对去雾问题，结合ARE和PCM显著提升性能。

Abstract: Unpaired image dehazing has attracted increasing attention due to its
flexible data requirements during model training. Dominant methods based on
contrastive learning not only introduce haze-unrelated content information, but
also ignore haze-specific properties in the frequency domain (\ie,~haze-related
degradation is mainly manifested in the amplitude spectrum). To address these
issues, we propose a novel frequency domain-based diffusion model, named \ours,
for fully exploiting the beneficial knowledge in unpaired clear data. In
particular, inspired by the strong generative ability shown by Diffusion Models
(DMs), we tackle the dehazing task from the perspective of frequency domain
reconstruction and perform the DMs to yield the amplitude spectrum consistent
with the distribution of clear images. To implement it, we propose an Amplitude
Residual Encoder (ARE) to extract the amplitude residuals, which effectively
compensates for the amplitude gap from the hazy to clear domains, as well as
provide supervision for the DMs training. In addition, we propose a Phase
Correction Module (PCM) to eliminate artifacts by further refining the phase
spectrum during dehazing with a simple attention mechanism. Experimental
results demonstrate that our \ours outperforms other state-of-the-art methods
on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: ET-Fuser通过集成令牌方法高效地统一了特征表示，提升了面部分析的性能。

Abstract: Facial analysis exhibits task-specific feature variations. While
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have enabled the fine-grained
representation of spatial information, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
facilitated the representation of semantic information at the patch level.
Although the generalization of conventional methodologies has advanced visual
interpretability, there remains paucity of research that preserves the unified
feature representation on single task learning during the training process. In
this work, we introduce ET-Fuser, a novel methodology for learning ensemble
token by leveraging attention mechanisms based on task priors derived from
pre-trained models for facial analysis. Specifically, we propose a robust prior
unification learning method that generates a ensemble token within a
self-attention mechanism, which shares the mutual information along the
pre-trained encoders. This ensemble token approach offers high efficiency with
negligible computational cost. Our results show improvements across a variety
of facial analysis, with statistically significant enhancements observed in the
feature representations.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖有限HDR数据集，泛化能力不足。通过扩散模型解决这一问题，但直接生成HDR镀铬球存在挑战。

Method: 提出DiffusionLight，通过迭代修复计算中值镀铬球作为稳定低频光照先验，并利用Exposure LoRA生成多曝光LDR图像合并为HDR光探针。进一步提出DiffusionLight-Turbo，通过Turbo LoRA直接预测迭代过程中的平均镀铬球，显著加速。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样化场景中生成逼真光照估计，并表现出对野外场景的优越泛化能力。

Conclusion: DiffusionLight及其加速版本DiffusionLight-Turbo有效解决了光照估计问题，提供了高质量结果和显著的速度提升。

Abstract: We introduce a simple yet effective technique for estimating lighting from a
single low-dynamic-range (LDR) image by reframing the task as a chrome ball
inpainting problem. This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,
Stable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing
methods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,
the task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or
inconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.
Our analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the
initial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic
outputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses
iterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to
serve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a
high-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,
an Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure
values, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is
time-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce
this overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to
about 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by
training a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the
iterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising
pass using a LoRA swapping technique. Experimental results that show our method
produces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates
superior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios. Our code is available at

Abstract: Body dynamics are crucial information for the analysis of human motions in
important research fields, ranging from biomechanics, sports science to
computer vision and graphics. Modern approaches collect the body dynamics,
external reactive force specifically, via force plates, synchronizing with
human motion capture data, and learn to estimate the dynamics from a black-box
deep learning model. Being specialized devices, force plates can only be
installed in laboratory setups, imposing a significant limitation on the
learning of human dynamics. To this end, we propose a novel method for
estimating human ground reaction dynamics directly from the more reliable
motion capture data with physics laws and computational simulation as
constrains. We introduce a highly accurate and robust method for computing
ground reaction forces from motion capture data using Euler's integration
scheme and PD algorithm. The physics-based reactive forces are used to inform
the learning model about the physics-informed motion dynamics thus improving
the estimation accuracy. The proposed approach was tested on the GroundLink
dataset, outperforming the baseline model on: 1) the ground reaction force
estimation accuracy compared to the force plates measurement; and 2) our
simulated root trajectory precision. The implementation code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级方法，通过学习后光照估计映射，将中性白平衡校正转换为美学偏好的校正，实现跨相机美学一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业自动白平衡（AWB）系统通常追求美学偏好而非准确中性校正，且现有学习型方法难以泛化到不同相机传感器。

Method: 提出一种后光照估计映射，将中性校正转换为美学偏好的校正，适用于任何中性AWB模块。

Result: 模型仅含约500参数，运行时间为0.024毫秒，在771张智能手机图像数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持兼容现有跨相机AWB技术的同时，实现了美学一致性和高效性能。

Abstract: The image signal processor (ISP) pipeline in modern cameras consists of
several modules that transform raw sensor data into visually pleasing images in
a display color space. Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is
essential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB
systems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than
accurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved
AWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera
sensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has
explored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral
white balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic
consistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms
neutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a
camera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any
neutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across
unseen cameras. Our proposed model is lightweight -- containing only $\sim$500
parameters -- and runs in just 0.024 milliseconds on a typical flagship mobile
CPU. Evaluated on a dataset of 771 smartphone images from three different
cameras, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining fully
compatible with existing cross-camera AWB techniques, introducing minimal
computational and memory overhead.

Method: 提出一种通用的数据变换方法，随机扰动PCA子空间投影，形成鲁棒集成，并引入自监督学习阶段优化模型。

Result: 在多种任务和数据集上验证了GTTA的通用性和有效性，包括图像分类、分割、语音识别等。

Conclusion: GTTA是一种高效且通用的测试时间增强方法，适用于多种任务，并能显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: We introduce Generalized Test-Time Augmentation (GTTA), a highly effective
method for improving the performance of a trained model, which unlike other
existing Test-Time Augmentation approaches from the literature is general
enough to be used off-the-shelf for many vision and non-vision tasks, such as
classification, regression, image segmentation and object detection. By
applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple
times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA forms robust ensembles
at test time in which, due to sound statistical properties, the structural and
systematic noises in the initial input data is filtered out and final estimator
errors are reduced. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a
final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an
unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus
reducing significantly the test time computational cost, at no loss in
accuracy. Our tests and comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on
various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image
classification and segmentation, speech recognition and house price prediction,
validate the generality of the proposed GTTA. Furthermore, we also prove its
effectiveness on the more specific real-world task of salmon segmentation and
detection in low-visibility underwater videos, for which we introduce
DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature.

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: LTDR通过模态特定路由和尾部令牌增强，提升了视觉语言MoE模型的性能。

Abstract: The mixture-of-experts (MoE), which replaces dense models with sparse
architectures, has gained attention in large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
achieving comparable performance with fewer activated parameters. Existing MoE
frameworks for LVLMs focus on token-to-expert routing (TER), encouraging
different experts to specialize in processing distinct tokens. However, these
frameworks often rely on the load balancing mechanism, overlooking the inherent
distributional differences between vision and language. To this end, we propose
a Long-Tailed Distribution-aware Router (LTDR) for vision-language TER,
tackling two challenges: (1) Distribution-aware router for modality-specific
routing. We observe that language TER follows a uniform distribution, whereas
vision TER exhibits a long-tailed distribution. This discrepancy necessitates
distinct routing strategies tailored to each modality. (2) Enhancing expert
activation for vision tail tokens. Recognizing the importance of vision tail
tokens, we introduce an oversampling-like strategy by increasing the number of
activated experts for these tokens. Experiments on extensive benchmarks
validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 物理对抗攻击方法在安全关键场景（如自动驾驶）中暴露了深度神经网络的脆弱性，但现有方法依赖耗时且不准确的模拟环境，且缺乏多视角鲁棒性。

Method: PGA框架利用3DGS实现快速精确的重建和逼真渲染，通过防止高斯间的相互遮挡和自遮挡，并采用min-max优化调整每个视角的背景，提升对抗效果和鲁棒性。

Result: 大量实验验证了PGA在对抗效果和鲁棒性上的优越性。

Conclusion: PGA为物理对抗攻击提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于复杂真实环境。

Abstract: Physical adversarial attack methods expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural
networks and pose a significant threat to safety-critical scenarios such as
autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising
approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial
effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies
on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by
simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the
real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training
images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial
camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons,
prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse
viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and
precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering
capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and
adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among
Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the
imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out
non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness and superiority of PGA. Our code is available

Result: Activation RMs在标准基准上优于现有方法，并在防止奖励黑客行为的新基准PreferenceHack上表现最佳。

Conclusion: Activation RMs是一种高效且安全的少样本奖励建模方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to
human preferences is a central challenge in improving the quality of the
models' generative outputs for real-world applications. A common approach is to
use reward modeling to encode preferences, enabling alignment via post-training
using reinforcement learning. However, traditional reward modeling is not
easily adaptable to new preferences because it requires a separate reward
model, commonly trained on large preference datasets. To address this, we
introduce Activation Reward Models (Activation RMs) -- a novel few-shot reward
modeling method that leverages activation steering to construct well-aligned
reward signals using minimal supervision and no additional model finetuning.
Activation RMs outperform existing few-shot reward modeling approaches such as
LLM-as-a-judge with in-context learning, voting-based scoring, and token
probability scoring on standard reward modeling benchmarks. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of Activation RMs in mitigating reward hacking
behaviors, highlighting their utility for safety-critical applications. Toward
this end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the
first to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format.
Finally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on
this benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.

Conclusion: 主动测量框架通过人机协作显著提升了科学测量的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: AI has the potential to transform scientific discovery by analyzing vast
datasets with little human effort. However, current workflows often do not
provide the accuracy or statistical guarantees that are needed. We introduce
active measurement, a human-in-the-loop AI framework for scientific
measurement. An AI model is used to predict measurements for individual units,
which are then sampled for human labeling using importance sampling. With each
new set of human labels, the AI model is improved and an unbiased Monte Carlo
estimate of the total measurement is refined. Active measurement can provide
precise estimates even with an imperfect AI model, and requires little human
effort when the AI model is very accurate. We derive novel estimators,
weighting schemes, and confidence intervals, and show that active measurement
reduces estimation error compared to alternatives in several measurement tasks.

Method: 通过伪标签增强生成新数据，并利用音频-视觉Mamba网络进行特征处理和交互，以提升模型解析能力。

Result: 在LLP数据集上，MUG在所有指标上均优于现有方法（如视觉段级和音频段级指标分别提升2.1%和1.2%）。

Conclusion: MUG通过伪标签增强和Mamba网络有效提升了音频-视觉视频解析的性能。

Abstract: The weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) aims to predict all
modality-specific events and locate their temporal boundaries. Despite
significant progress, due to the limitations of the weakly-supervised and the
deficiencies of the model architecture, existing methods are lacking in
simultaneously improving both the segment-level prediction and the event-level
prediction. In this work, we propose a audio-visual Mamba network with pseudo
labeling aUGmentation (MUG) for emphasising the uniqueness of each segment and
excluding the noise interference from the alternate modalities. Specifically,
we annotate some of the pseudo-labels based on previous work. Using unimodal
pseudo-labels, we perform cross-modal random combinations to generate new data,
which can enhance the model's ability to parse various segment-level event
combinations. For feature processing and interaction, we employ a audio-visual
mamba network. The AV-Mamba enhances the ability to perceive different segments
and excludes additional modal noise while sharing similar modal information.

Conclusion: FixTalk为高质量说话头部生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Talking head generation is gaining significant importance across various
domains, with a growing demand for high-quality rendering. However, existing
methods often suffer from identity leakage (IL) and rendering artifacts (RA),
particularly in extreme cases. Through an in-depth analysis of previous
approaches, we identify two key insights: (1) IL arises from identity
information embedded within motion features, and (2) this identity information
can be leveraged to address RA. Building on these findings, this paper
introduces FixTalk, a novel framework designed to simultaneously resolve both
issues for high-quality talking head generation. Firstly, we propose an
Enhanced Motion Indicator (EMI) to effectively decouple identity information
from motion features, mitigating the impact of IL on generated talking heads.
To address RA, we introduce an Enhanced Detail Indicator (EDI), which utilizes
the leaked identity information to supplement missing details, thus fixing the
artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FixTalk effectively mitigates
IL and RA, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶依赖高清地图（HD），但在线构建HD地图仍具挑战性，需要统一建模复杂道路拓扑。

Result: 实验证明该方法大幅优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过先验信息和时序一致性建模，有效提升了HD地图在线构建的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Most autonomous cars rely on the availability of high-definition (HD) maps.
Current research aims to address this constraint by directly predicting HD map
elements from onboard sensors and reasoning about the relationships between the
predicted map and traffic elements. Despite recent advancements, the coherent
online construction of HD maps remains a challenging endeavor, as it
necessitates modeling the high complexity of road topologies in a unified and
consistent manner. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent approach to
predict lane segments and their corresponding topology, as well as road
boundaries, all by leveraging prior map information represented by commonly
available standard-definition (SD) maps. We propose a network architecture,
which leverages hybrid lane segment encodings comprising prior information and
denoising techniques to enhance training stability and performance.
Furthermore, we facilitate past frames for temporal consistency. Our
experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms previous
methods by a large margin, highlighting the benefits of our modeling scheme.

Motivation: 胎儿腹部畸形是严重的先天性异常，需要准确诊断以指导妊娠管理并降低死亡率。现有AI方法多关注图像级分类，缺乏病例级诊断。

Method: 采用混合注意力专家模块（MoAE）加权不同平面的注意力头；提出医学知识驱动的特征选择模块（MFS）进行自监督图像标记选择；结合提示原型学习（PPL）增强MFS。

Result: 在包含2,419个病例和24,748张图像的数据集上验证，方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在胎儿腹部异常分类中表现出色，为病例级诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fetal abdominal malformations are serious congenital anomalies that require
accurate diagnosis to guide pregnancy management and reduce mortality. Although
AI has demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnosis, its application
to prenatal abdominal anomalies remains limited. Most existing studies focus on
image-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing
less emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level
multiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane
localization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound.
Our contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts
module (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes. Secondly,
we propose a medical-knowledge-driven feature selection module (MFS) to align
image features with medical knowledge, performing self-supervised image token
selection at the case-level. Finally, we propose a prompt-based prototype
learning (PPL) to enhance the MFS. Extensively validated on a large prenatal
abdominal ultrasound dataset containing 2,419 cases, with a total of 24,748
images and 6 categories, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
competitors. Codes are available at:https://github.com/LL-AC/AAcls.

TL;DR: 论文提出CaptionSmiths方法，通过量化描述长度、描述性和词汇独特性，实现图像字幕模型对语言模式的灵活控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像字幕模型难以精细控制生成字幕的属性，如长度和描述性，且缺乏平滑过渡能力。

Method: 通过量化字幕属性为连续标量值，并在两个极端状态向量间插值实现条件控制。

Result: 模型能平滑调整字幕属性，词汇对齐优于基线，控制长度误差降低506%。

Conclusion: CaptionSmiths方法显著提升了图像字幕模型对语言模式的灵活控制能力。

Abstract: An image captioning model flexibly switching its language pattern, e.g.,
descriptiveness and length, should be useful since it can be applied to diverse
applications. However, despite the dramatic improvement in generative
vision-language models, fine-grained control over the properties of generated
captions is not easy due to two reasons: (i) existing models are not given the
properties as a condition during training and (ii) existing models cannot
smoothly transition its language pattern from one state to the other. Given
this challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single
captioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach
quantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and
uniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation.
Given the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two
endpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very
short caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate
that the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output
captions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines. For instance,
CaptionSmiths reduces the error in controlling caption length by 506\% despite
better lexical alignment. Code will be available on

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于梯度方向一致性的OOD检测方法，通过短路虚假梯度来提升检测性能，同时保持ID分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放环境中，OOD检测对模型安全部署至关重要。观察到ID样本的梯度方向一致，而OOD样本梯度混乱，由此提出改进方法。

Method: 在推理阶段短路虚假梯度利用的特征坐标，并通过一阶近似避免重复计算，保持ID分类性能。

Result: 在标准OOD基准测试中表现显著提升，方法轻量且易于集成。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际应用中的OOD检测提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for safely deploying deep
models in open-world environments, where inputs may lie outside the training
distribution. During inference on a model trained exclusively with
In-Distribution (ID) data, we observe a salient gradient phenomenon: around an
ID sample, the local gradient directions for "enhancing" that sample's
predicted class remain relatively consistent, whereas OOD samples--unseen in
training--exhibit disorganized or conflicting gradient directions in the same
neighborhood. Motivated by this observation, we propose an inference-stage
technique to short-circuit those feature coordinates that spurious gradients
exploit to inflate OOD confidence, while leaving ID classification largely
intact. To circumvent the expense of recomputing the logits after this gradient
short-circuit, we further introduce a local first-order approximation that
accurately captures the post-modification outputs without a second forward
pass. Experiments on standard OOD benchmarks show our approach yields
substantial improvements. Moreover, the method is lightweight and requires
minimal changes to the standard inference pipeline, offering a practical path
toward robust OOD detection in real-world applications.

Conclusion: DocShaDiffusion有效解决了彩色阴影去除问题，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Document shadow removal is a crucial task in the field of document image
enhancement. However, existing methods tend to remove shadows with constant
color background and ignore color shadows. In this paper, we first design a
diffusion model in latent space for document image shadow removal, called
DocShaDiffusion. It translates shadow images from pixel space to latent space,
enabling the model to more easily capture essential features. To address the
issue of color shadows, we design a shadow soft-mask generation module (SSGM).
It is able to produce accurate shadow mask and add noise into shadow regions
specially. Guided by the shadow mask, a shadow mask-aware guided diffusion
module (SMGDM) is proposed to remove shadows from document images by
supervising the diffusion and denoising process. We also propose a
shadow-robust perceptual feature loss to preserve details and structures in
document images. Moreover, we develop a large-scale synthetic document color
shadow removal dataset (SDCSRD). It simulates the distribution of realistic
color shadows and provides powerful supports for the training of models.
Experiments on three public datasets validate the proposed method's superiority
over state-of-the-art. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

Result: 实验证明DiffMark在典型Deepfake篡改中表现有效。

Conclusion: DiffMark通过扩散模型和对抗性指导，显著提升了水印对Deepfake篡改的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant security and privacy threats through malicious
facial manipulations. While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity
verification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient
robustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of
watermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel
robust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By
modifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and
watermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise
and generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial
condition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that
gradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus
better adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the
fusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF)
module that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract
watermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention.
To enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we
integrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake
manipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that
employs specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling
process to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes.

Motivation: 现有基于最大团搜索的方法虽召回率高，但时间复杂度指数级，不适用于实时应用。

Method: 定义TurboClique为高度约束兼容图中的3-团，结合PGS算法线性搜索高SC$^2$分数匹配对。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现SOTA性能，速度提升显著（如3DMatch+FCGF上快208.22倍）。

Conclusion: TurboReg在保持高召回率的同时大幅提升效率，适用于实时PCR应用。

Abstract: Robust estimation is essential in correspondence-based Point Cloud
Registration (PCR). Existing methods using maximal clique search in
compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time
complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel
lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided
Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a
highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique
allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained
compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable
transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$
scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with
higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity
and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with
exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with
substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset,
TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving
higher recall. Our code is accessible at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有像素级异常分割方法忽视像素间空间相关性且全局阈值策略效果不佳，导致分割碎片化和误判。

Method: OoDDINO采用两阶段级联架构：1) 正交不确定性感知融合策略（OUAFS）整合多指标；2) 自适应双阈值网络（ADT-Net）动态生成区域阈值。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，OoDDINO优于现有方法，并兼容其他像素级模型。

Conclusion: OoDDINO通过多级策略显著提升异常分割性能，具有兼容性和实用性。

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation aims to identify Out-of-Distribution (OoD) anomalous
objects within images. Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly
scores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment
anomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant
challenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations
among pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2)
variabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing
global thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or
miss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel
multi-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these
limitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO
combines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level
segmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture. Initially, we
propose an Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) that
sequentially integrates multiple uncertainty metrics with visual
representations, employing orthogonal constraints to strengthen the detection
model's capacity for localizing anomalous regions accurately. Subsequently, we
develop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically
generates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs
and pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding
strategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained
anomaly segmentation. The proposed framework is compatible with other
pixel-wise anomaly detection models, which acts as a plug-in to boost the
performance. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate our
framework's superiority and compatibility over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: NOCTIS通过结合先进模型和优化匹配策略，显著提升了新物体实例分割的性能。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some
example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision.
Designing a model general enough to be employed, for all kinds of novel
objects, without (re-) training, has proven to be a difficult task. To handle
this, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic
Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and
improves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also
leverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and
DINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise
bounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's
zero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The
quality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance
to our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an
object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the
average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D,
calculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance
between each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image
grid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and
mask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score.
We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning,
outperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the
BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects"
task.

Motivation: 现有方法（如REPA）在训练扩散模型时利用外部视觉表示，但在推理过程中未能充分利用判别性表示。

Method: REG方法通过将低层图像潜在表示与预训练模型的高层类别标记纠缠，直接在纯噪声中生成一致的图像-类别对。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上，REG显著加速了收敛，训练效率提高了63倍和23倍，且仅需400K次迭代即可超越4M次迭代的REPA。

Conclusion: REG方法通过语义知识的主动引导，显著提升了图像生成的质量和效率，且推理开销极小。

Abstract: REPA and its variants effectively mitigate training challenges in diffusion
models by incorporating external visual representations from pretrained models,
through alignment between the noisy hidden projections of denoising networks
and foundational clean image representations. We argue that the external
alignment, which is absent during the entire denoising inference process, falls
short of fully harnessing the potential of discriminative representations. In
this work, we propose a straightforward method called Representation
Entanglement for Generation (REG), which entangles low-level image latents with
a single high-level class token from pretrained foundation models for
denoising. REG acquires the capability to produce coherent image-class pairs
directly from pure noise, substantially improving both generation quality and
training efficiency. This is accomplished with negligible additional inference
overhead, requiring only one single additional token for denoising (<0.5\%
increase in FLOPs and latency). The inference process concurrently reconstructs
both image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired
semantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process.
On ImageNet 256$\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence
acceleration, achieving $\textbf{63}\times$ and $\textbf{23}\times$ faster
training than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively. More impressively,
SiT-L/2 + REG trained for merely 400K iterations outperforms SiT-XL/2 + REPA
trained for 4M iterations ($\textbf{10}\times$ longer). Code is available at:

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and detecting its leaks early via
hyperspectral satellite imagery can help mitigate climate change. Meanwhile,
many existing missions operate in manual tasking regimes only, thus missing
potential events of interest. To overcome slow downlink rates cost-effectively,
onboard detection is a viable solution. However, traditional methane
enhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited
onboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on
efficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE,
CEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a
Mag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art
algorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection
potential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).
Our results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both
acceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally
efficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the
other more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than
original Mag1c on resource-limited hardware. Additionally, we propose and
evaluate three band selection strategies. One of them can outperform the method
traditionally used in the field while using fewer channels, leading to even
faster processing without compromising accuracy. This research lays the
foundation for future advancements in onboard methane detection with minimal
hardware requirements, improving timely data delivery. The produced code, data,

Abstract: Visual pose tracking is playing an increasingly vital role in industrial
contexts in recent years. However, the pose tracking for industrial metal

The method uses image control points to generate edge feature for optimization
actively instead of 6DoF pose-based rendering, and serve them as optimization

Abstract: High-definition (HD) map construction methods are crucial for providing
precise and comprehensive static environmental information, which is essential
for autonomous driving systems. While Camera-LiDAR fusion techniques have shown
promising results by integrating data from both modalities, existing approaches
primarily focus on improving model accuracy and often neglect the robustness of
perception models, which is a critical aspect for real-world applications. In
this paper, we explore strategies to enhance the robustness of multi-modal
fusion methods for HD map construction while maintaining high accuracy. We
propose three key components: data augmentation, a novel multi-modal fusion
module, and a modality dropout training strategy. These components are
evaluated on a challenging dataset containing 10 days of NuScenes data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly
enhance the robustness of baseline methods. Furthermore, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the clean validation set of the NuScenes
dataset. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and
reliable HD map construction models, advancing their applicability in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Project website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVC-DPO是一个后训练框架，通过偏好对齐提升视频MLLMs的标题生成能力，专注于时空动态和空间信息，在VDC基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频MLLMs在标题生成任务中难以根据人类偏好调整焦点，因此提出AVC-DPO以解决这一问题。

Method: 设计增强提示，针对时空动态和空间信息，通过偏好感知训练和标题对齐优化模型。

Result: 在LOVE@CVPR'25 Workshop Track 1A中表现卓越，VDC基准测试排名第一。

Conclusion: AVC-DPO通过偏好对齐显著提升了视频MLLMs的标题生成能力。

Abstract: Although video multimodal large language models (video MLLMs) have achieved
substantial progress in video captioning tasks, it remains challenging to
adjust the focal emphasis of video captions according to human preferences. To
address this limitation, we propose Aligned Video Captioning via Direct
Preference Optimization (AVC-DPO), a post-training framework designed to
enhance captioning capabilities in video MLLMs through preference alignment.
Our approach designs enhanced prompts that specifically target temporal
dynamics and spatial information-two key factors that humans care about when
watching a video-thereby incorporating human-centric preferences. AVC-DPO
leverages the same foundation model's caption generation responses under varied
prompt conditions to conduct preference-aware training and caption alignment.
Using this framework, we have achieved exceptional performance in the
LOVE@CVPR'25 Workshop Track 1A: Video Detailed Captioning Challenge, achieving
first place on the Video Detailed Captioning (VDC) benchmark according to the
VDCSCORE evaluation metric.

Overall, this review offers a structured overview of the field, highlights
useful datasets, and outlines the key challenges and future directions for
AI-based pest monitoring systems.

Motivation: 尽管ReFlow在文本到图像生成中表现优异，但其在真实图像编辑中的应用仍具挑战性。

Method: 分析多模态Transformer块的中间表示，提取三个关键特征，利用中步潜在表示进行结构保留，并通过调整注意力提升编辑效果。

Result: 在两个基准测试中优于九种基线方法，并通过人类评估验证了用户偏好。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练、无需用户提供掩码，且在无源提示的情况下仍可应用，表现出色。

Abstract: Rectified Flow text-to-image models surpass diffusion models in image quality
and text alignment, but adapting ReFlow for real-image editing remains
challenging. We propose a new real-image editing method for ReFlow by analyzing
the intermediate representations of multimodal transformer blocks and
identifying three key features. To extract these features from real images with
sufficient structural preservation, we leverage mid-step latent, which is
inverted only up to the mid-step. We then adapt attention during injection to
improve editability and enhance alignment to the target text. Our method is
training-free, requires no user-provided mask, and can be applied even without
a source prompt. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks with nine baselines
demonstrate its superior performance over prior methods, further validated by
human evaluations confirming a strong user preference for our approach.

Result: 新方法提高了检测到的树冠数量，并分析了其优缺点和改进空间。

Conclusion: 提出的规则方法增强了树冠检测的鲁棒性和准确性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Global warming, loss of biodiversity, and air pollution are among the most
significant problems facing Earth. One of the primary challenges in addressing
these issues is the lack of monitoring forests to protect them. To tackle this
problem, it is important to leverage remote sensing and computer vision methods
to automate monitoring applications. Hence, automatic tree crown detection
algorithms emerged based on traditional and deep learning methods. In this
study, we first introduce two different tree crown detection methods based on
these approaches. Then, we form a novel rule-based approach that integrates
these two methods to enhance robustness and accuracy of tree crown detection
results. While traditional methods are employed for feature extraction and
segmentation of forested areas, deep learning methods are used to detect tree
crowns in our method. With the proposed rule-based approach, we post-process
these results, aiming to increase the number of detected tree crowns through
neighboring trees and localized operations. We compare the obtained results
with the proposed method in terms of the number of detected tree crowns and
report the advantages, disadvantages, and areas for improvement of the obtained
outcomes.

Abstract: The collection and release of street-level recordings as Open Data play a
vital role in advancing autonomous driving systems and AI research. However,
these datasets pose significant privacy risks, particularly for pedestrians,
due to the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that extends
beyond biometric traits such as faces. In this paper, we present cRID, a novel
cross-modal framework combining Large Vision-Language Models, Graph Attention
Networks, and representation learning to detect textual describable clues of
PII and enhance person re-identification (Re-ID). Our approach focuses on
identifying and leveraging interpretable features, enabling the detection of
semantically meaningful PII beyond low-level appearance cues. We conduct a
systematic evaluation of PII presence in person image datasets. Our experiments
show improved performance in practical cross-dataset Re-ID scenarios, notably
from Market-1501 to CUHK03-np (detected), highlighting the framework's
practical utility. Code is available at https://github.com/RAufschlaeger/cRID.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 息肉分割在结肠镜图像中至关重要，但现有方法在弱边界和模糊区域表现不佳，难以满足临床实时应用需求。

Method: 结合边界蒸馏模块和1D-2D Mamba适配器，增强全局上下文交互和边界特征学习。

Result: 在五个数据集上的评估显示，SAM-MaGuP优于现有方法，实现了更高的分割准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SAM-MaGuP通过创新设计，为息肉分割领域设定了新标准，解决了弱边界和模糊区域的挑战。

Abstract: Polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images is crucial for early detection and
diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, this task remains a significant
challenge due to the substantial variations in polyp shape, size, and color, as
well as the high similarity between polyps and surrounding tissues, often
compounded by indistinct boundaries. While existing encoder-decoder CNN and
transformer-based approaches have shown promising results, they struggle with
stable segmentation performance on polyps with weak or blurry boundaries. These
methods exhibit limited abilities to distinguish between polyps and non-polyps
and capture essential boundary cues. Moreover, their generalizability still
falls short of meeting the demands of real-time clinical applications. To
address these limitations, we propose SAM-MaGuP, a groundbreaking approach for
robust polyp segmentation. By incorporating a boundary distillation module and
a 1D-2D Mamba adapter within the Segment Anything Model (SAM), SAM-MaGuP excels
at resolving weak boundary challenges and amplifies feature learning through
enriched global contextual interactions. Extensive evaluations across five
diverse datasets reveal that SAM-MaGuP outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving unmatched segmentation accuracy and robustness. Our key innovations,
a Mamba-guided boundary prior and a 1D-2D Mamba block, set a new benchmark in
the field, pushing the boundaries of polyp segmentation to new heights.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) has evolved significantly, moving from
isolated recognition approaches to complex, continuous gloss-free translation
systems. This paper explores the impact of pose-based data preprocessing
techniques - normalization, interpolation, and augmentation - on SLT
performance. We employ a transformer-based architecture, adapting a modified T5
encoder-decoder model to process pose representations. Through extensive
ablation studies on YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets, we analyze how different
preprocessing strategies affect translation accuracy. Our results demonstrate
that appropriate normalization, interpolation, and augmentation techniques can
significantly improve model robustness and generalization abilities.
Additionally, we provide a deep analysis of the model's attentions and reveal
interesting behavior suggesting that adding a dedicated register token can
improve overall model performance. We publish our code on our GitHub
repository, including the preprocessed YouTubeASL data.

Conclusion: TrackingMiM通过嵌套Mamba扫描机制有效解决了时间不一致性问题，为无人机跟踪提供了高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) model has long struggled with the challenge of
quadratic complexity, a limitation that becomes especially critical in unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking systems, where data must be processed in real
time. In this study, we explore the recently proposed State-Space Model, Mamba,
leveraging its computational efficiency and capability for long-sequence
modeling to effectively process dense image sequences in tracking tasks. First,
we highlight the issue of temporal inconsistency in existing Mamba-based
methods, specifically the failure to account for temporal continuity in the
Mamba scanning mechanism. Secondly, building upon this insight,we propose
TrackingMiM, a Mamba-in-Mamba architecture, a minimal-computation burden model
for handling image sequence of tracking problem. In our framework, the mamba
scan is performed in a nested way while independently process temporal and
spatial coherent patch tokens. While the template frame is encoded as query
token and utilized for tracking in every scan. Extensive experiments conducted
on five UAV tracking benchmarks confirm that the proposed TrackingMiM achieves
state-of-the-art precision while offering noticeable higher speed in UAV
tracking.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced numerous opportunities for human
assistance and task automation in medicine. However, it suffers from poor
generalization in the presence of shifts in the data distribution. In the
context of AI-based computed tomography (CT) analysis, significant data
distribution shifts can be caused by changes in scanner manufacturer,
reconstruction technique or dose. AI harmonization techniques can address this
problem by reducing distribution shifts caused by various acquisition settings.
This paper presents an open-source benchmark dataset containing CT scans of an
anthropomorphic phantom acquired with various scanners and settings, which
purpose is to foster the development of AI harmonization techniques. Using a
phantom allows fixing variations attributed to inter- and intra-patient
variations. The dataset includes 1378 image series acquired with 13 scanners
from 4 manufacturers across 8 institutions using a harmonized protocol as well
as several acquisition doses. Additionally, we present a methodology, baseline
results and open-source code to assess image- and feature-level stability and
liver tissue classification, promoting the development of AI harmonization
strategies.

Abstract: The field of neuromorphic vision is developing rapidly, and event cameras are
finding their way into more and more applications. However, the data stream
from these sensors is characterised by significant noise. In this paper, we
propose a method for event data that is capable of removing approximately 99\%
of noise while preserving the majority of the valid signal. We have proposed
four algorithms based on the matrix of infinite impulse response (IIR) filters
method. We compared them on several event datasets that were further modified
by adding artificially generated noise and noise recorded with dynamic vision
sensor. The proposed methods use about 30KB of memory for a sensor with a
resolution of 1280 x 720 and is therefore well suited for implementation in
embedded devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合判别式学习和扩散生成学习的框架IDGBR，用于改进遥感语义分割中的边界精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖判别式学习，擅长捕捉低频特征但忽略高频特征，而扩散生成模型擅长生成高频细节但语义推理不足。

Method: 结合判别式和生成式学习，先通过判别式模型生成粗分割图，再通过扩散去噪过程细化边界。

Result: 在五个遥感语义分割数据集上的实验验证了IDGBR能够一致地改进边界精度。

Conclusion: IDGBR框架有效结合了两种学习的优势，显著提升了边界分割的精度。

Abstract: Remote sensing semantic segmentation must address both what the ground
objects are within an image and where they are located. Consequently,
segmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of
large-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise
localization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information).
However, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning,
which excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its
inherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic
segmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models
excel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms
that the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability
to learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models
exhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided
solely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both
discriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of
Discriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement
(IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map
using a discriminative backbone model. This map and the original image are fed
into a conditioning guidance network to jointly learn a guidance representation
subsequently leveraged by an iterative denoising diffusion process refining the
coarse segmentation. Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic
segmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our
framework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results
from diverse discriminative architectures. The source code will be available at
https://github.com/KeyanHu-git/IDGBR.

Method: 采用扩散变换器（DiT）架构，替换传统U-Net去噪器，通过轻量级通道连接适配器和LoRA微调注入草图信息。

Result: 在SAKUGA数据集上，SketchColour在所有指标上优于现有视频上色方法，且仅使用一半训练数据。

Conclusion: SketchColour能够生成时间一致性高、伪影少的动画，显著提升了2D动画制作的效率。

Abstract: The production of high-quality 2D animation is highly labor-intensive
process, as animators are currently required to draw and color a large number
of frames by hand. We present SketchColour, the first sketch-to-colour pipeline
for 2D animation built on a diffusion transformer (DiT) backbone. By replacing
the conventional U-Net denoiser with a DiT-style architecture and injecting
sketch information via lightweight channel-concatenation adapters accompanied
with LoRA finetuning, our method natively integrates conditioning without the
parameter and memory bloat of a duplicated ControlNet, greatly reducing
parameter count and GPU memory usage. Evaluated on the SAKUGA dataset,
SketchColour outperforms previous state-of-the-art video colourization methods
across all metrics, despite using only half the training data of competing
models. Our approach produces temporally coherent animations with minimal
artifacts such as colour bleeding or object deformation. Our code is available

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based image denoising methods have shown impressive
performance; however, many lack the flexibility to adjust the denoising
strength based on the noise levels, camera settings, and user preferences. In
this paper, we introduce a new controllable denoising framework that adaptively
removes noise from images by utilizing information from camera parameters.
Specifically, we focus on ISO, shutter speed, and F-number, which are closely
related to noise levels. We convert these selected parameters into a vector to
control and enhance the performance of the denoising network. Experimental
results show that our method seamlessly adds controllability to standard
denoising neural networks and improves their performance. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频深度估计中存在尺度不一致和几何不一致的问题，主要由于滑动窗口分割和忽略3D几何结构。

Method: 引入尺度引导和几何引导，前者同步窗口间的深度尺度，后者基于3D约束对齐窗口内的几何结构。

Result: 实验表明，DepthSync在多个数据集上显著提升了深度估计的尺度和几何一致性，尤其适用于长视频。

Conclusion: DepthSync通过协同作用的两项引导，有效解决了长视频深度估计中的一致性问题。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video depth estimation methods have achieved remarkable
success with strong generalization ability. However, predicting depth for long
videos remains challenging. Existing methods typically split videos into
overlapping sliding windows, leading to accumulated scale discrepancies across
different windows, particularly as the number of windows increases.
Additionally, these methods rely solely on 2D diffusion priors, overlooking the
inherent 3D geometric structure of video depths, which results in geometrically
inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose DepthSync, a novel,
training-free framework using diffusion guidance to achieve scale- and
geometry-consistent depth predictions for long videos. Specifically, we
introduce scale guidance to synchronize the depth scale across windows and
geometry guidance to enforce geometric alignment within windows based on the
inherent 3D constraints in video depths. These two terms work synergistically,
steering the denoising process toward consistent depth predictions. Experiments
on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in producing depth
estimates with improved scale and geometry consistency, particularly for long
videos.

Abstract: The widespread use of deep learning face recognition raises several security
concerns. Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor
attacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured
in the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the
first system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition
systems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of
DNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the
first time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and
face landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained
with large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our
models, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack
cases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function
of a system. Finally, we provide stakeholders with several best practices and

### [91] [Perception-Oriented Latent Coding for High-Performance Compressed Domain Semantic Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01608)
*Xu Zhang,Ming Lu,Yan Chen,Zhan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种感知导向的潜在编码方法（POLC），通过丰富潜在特征的语义内容，提升压缩域语义推理性能，同时减少微调参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于MSE优化的图像编码模型在潜在空间中语义丰富性不足，且微调计算成本高。

Method: 提出POLC方法，通过优化潜在特征的语义内容，仅需轻量级适配器进行微调。

Result: POLC在保持与生成式图像编码方法相当的率感知性能的同时，显著提升视觉任务性能，且微调开销极小。

Conclusion: POLC为压缩域语义推理提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, compressed domain semantic inference has primarily relied on
learned image coding models optimized for mean squared error (MSE). However,
MSE-oriented optimization tends to yield latent spaces with limited semantic
richness, which hinders effective semantic inference in downstream tasks.
Moreover, achieving high performance with these models often requires
fine-tuning the entire vision model, which is computationally intensive,
especially for large models. To address these problems, we introduce
Perception-Oriented Latent Coding (POLC), an approach that enriches the
semantic content of latent features for high-performance compressed domain
semantic inference. With the semantically rich latent space, POLC requires only
a plug-and-play adapter for fine-tuning, significantly reducing the parameter
count compared to previous MSE-oriented methods. Experimental results
demonstrate that POLC achieves rate-perception performance comparable to
state-of-the-art generative image coding methods while markedly enhancing
performance in vision tasks, with minimal fine-tuning overhead. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P3HOT框架通过结合提示引导和人类近端感知，解决了HOT检测中过度分割和类别一致性问题，并在多个指标上取得了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HOT检测模型局限于单一图像类型，导致过度分割和类别不一致，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出P3HOT框架，结合语义驱动的提示机制和人类近端感知机制，并引入RJLoss和AD-Acc.评估指标。

Result: 在HOT-Annotated数据集上，SC-Acc.、mIoU、wIoU和AD-Acc.指标分别提升0.7、2.0、1.6和11.0。

Conclusion: P3HOT在HOT检测任务中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性，并提供了新的评估标准。

Abstract: The task of Human-Object conTact (HOT) detection involves identifying the
specific areas of the human body that are touching objects. Nevertheless,
current models are restricted to just one type of image, often leading to too
much segmentation in areas with little interaction, and struggling to maintain
category consistency within specific regions. To tackle this issue, a HOT
framework, termed \textbf{P3HOT}, is proposed, which blends \textbf{P}rompt
guidance and human \textbf{P}roximal \textbf{P}erception. To begin with, we
utilize a semantic-driven prompt mechanism to direct the network's attention
towards the relevant regions based on the correlation between image and text.
Then a human proximal perception mechanism is employed to dynamically perceive
key depth range around the human, using learnable parameters to effectively
eliminate regions where interactions are not expected. Calculating depth
resolves the uncertainty of the overlap between humans and objects in a 2D
perspective, providing a quasi-3D viewpoint. Moreover, a Regional Joint Loss
(RJLoss) has been created as a new loss to inhibit abnormal categories in the
same area. A new evaluation metric called ``AD-Acc.'' is introduced to address
the shortcomings of existing methods in addressing negative samples.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in four metrics across two benchmark datasets.
Specifically, our model achieves an improvement of \textbf{0.7}$\uparrow$,
\textbf{2.0}$\uparrow$, \textbf{1.6}$\uparrow$, and \textbf{11.0}$\uparrow$ in
SC-Acc., mIoU, wIoU, and AD-Acc. metrics, respectively, on the HOT-Annotated
dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/YuxiaoWang-AI/P3HOT.

*Camille Billouard,Dawa Derksen,Alexandre Constantin,Bruno Vallet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Snake-NeRF是一种扩展到大场景的NeRF框架，通过分块处理解决内存限制问题，支持单设备运行且保持高质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF方法因内存限制仅适用于小场景，需解决大场景3D重建问题。

Method: 提出Snake-NeRF框架，采用分块策略和重叠裁剪图像，结合2×2 3D分块推进策略和分段采样器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能线性处理大卫星图像，单GPU运行且质量无损失。

Conclusion: Snake-NeRF成功扩展了NeRF的应用范围，适用于大场景3D重建。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as a paradigm for 3D
reconstruction from multiview satellite imagery. However, state-of-the-art NeRF
methods are typically constrained to small scenes due to the memory footprint
during training, which we study in this paper. Previous work on large-scale
NeRFs palliate this by dividing the scene into NeRFs. This paper introduces
Snake-NeRF, a framework that scales to large scenes. Our out-of-core method
eliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and
operates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest
into NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with
overlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We
introduce a novel $2\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented
sampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges.
Our experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be
processed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise
in quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础MDE模型在复杂开放世界环境中表现不佳，尤其是在光照变化、恶劣天气和传感器失真等挑战性条件下。

Method: 提出无监督一致性正则化微调范式，仅需少量未标记数据，并引入空间距离约束以学习补丁级相对关系。

Result: 实验证明DepthAnything-AC在多样化基准测试中具有零样本能力，包括真实世界恶劣天气基准、合成失真基准和通用基准。

Conclusion: DepthAnything-AC通过创新方法解决了复杂环境下的深度估计问题，表现出色。

Abstract: We present Depth Anything at Any Condition (DepthAnything-AC), a foundation
monocular depth estimation (MDE) model capable of handling diverse
environmental conditions. Previous foundation MDE models achieve impressive
performance across general scenes but not perform well in complex open-world
environments that involve challenging conditions, such as illumination
variations, adverse weather, and sensor-induced distortions. To overcome the
challenges of data scarcity and the inability of generating high-quality
pseudo-labels from corrupted images, we propose an unsupervised consistency
regularization finetuning paradigm that requires only a relatively small amount
of unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose the Spatial Distance Constraint to
explicitly enforce the model to learn patch-level relative relationships,
resulting in clearer semantic boundaries and more accurate details.
Experimental results demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of DepthAnything-AC
across diverse benchmarks, including real-world adverse weather benchmarks,
synthetic corruption benchmarks, and general benchmarks.

TL;DR: SAILViT是一种渐进式特征学习的ViT，用于提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的性能，解决参数初始化和模态语义差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ViTs在图像-文本对比学习或自监督机制中表现优异，但难以直接与LLMs进行联合训练，存在参数冲突和模态语义差距问题。

Method: 提出SAILViT，通过渐进式特征细化实现粗到细的特征对齐和世界知识注入。

Result: SAILViT在不同参数规模、架构、训练策略和数据规模下表现出强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力，显著提升MLLMs在OpenCompass基准上的性能。

Conclusion: SAILViT有效解决了ViTs与LLMs联合训练的挑战，为复杂多模态交互提供了性能突破。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential as foundation backbones in
establishing the visual comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Although most ViTs achieve impressive performance through
image-text pair-based contrastive learning or self-supervised mechanisms, they
struggle to engage in connector-based co-training directly with LLMs due to
potential parameter initialization conflicts and modality semantic gaps. To
address the above challenges, this paper proposes SAILViT, a gradual feature
learning-enhanced ViT for facilitating MLLMs to break through performance
bottlenecks in complex multimodal interactions. SAILViT achieves
coarse-to-fine-grained feature alignment and world knowledge infusion with
gradual feature refinement, which better serves target training demands. We
perform thorough empirical analyses to confirm the powerful robustness and
generalizability of SAILViT across different dimensions, including parameter
sizes, model architectures, training strategies, and data scales. Equipped with
SAILViT, existing MLLMs show significant and consistent performance
improvements on the OpenCompass benchmark across extensive downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LASAD的新型注意力机制，通过保留2D空间关系解决了线性注意力在图像生成中的性能下降问题，并基于此构建了高效的自回归图像生成模型LASADGen。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归模型主要依赖Transformer架构，但其二次计算复杂度和高内存开销限制了效率。线性注意力虽能降低负担，但在图像生成中因无法捕捉长距离依赖而性能下降。

Method: 提出Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD)，通过基于真实2D空间位置计算衰减因子，保留空间关系。基于LASAD构建了LASADGen模型。

Result: 在ImageNet上的实验表明，LASADGen在图像生成质量和计算效率上均达到最优水平。

Conclusion: LASADGen成功平衡了线性注意力的高效性和高质量图像生成所需的空间理解能力。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have garnered significant attention in image
generation for their ability to effectively capture both local and global
structures within visual data. However, prevalent AR models predominantly rely
on the transformer architectures, which are beset by quadratic computational
complexity concerning input sequence length and substantial memory overhead due
to the necessity of maintaining key-value caches. Although linear attention
mechanisms have successfully reduced this burden in language models, our
initial experiments reveal that they significantly degrade image generation
quality because of their inability to capture critical long-range dependencies
in visual data. We propose Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD), a
novel attention mechanism that explicitly preserves genuine 2D spatial
relationships within the flattened image sequences by computing
position-dependent decay factors based on true 2D spatial location rather than
1D sequence positions. Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an
autoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant
spatial contexts with linear complexity. Experiments on ImageNet show LASADGen
achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance and computational
efficiency, bridging the gap between linear attention's efficiency and spatial
understanding needed for high-quality generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有立体匹配模型在恶劣天气下表现不佳，主要由于训练数据稀缺和特征提取困难。

Method: 1. 提出扩散模拟管道生成高质量合成数据；2. 设计结合ConvNet和去噪Transformer的特征编码器。

Result: 实验表明RobuSTereo显著提升了模型在恶劣天气下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: RobuSTereo通过数据增强和特征优化，有效解决了立体匹配模型在恶劣天气下的性能问题。

Abstract: Learning-based stereo matching models struggle in adverse weather conditions
due to the scarcity of corresponding training data and the challenges in
extracting discriminative features from degraded images. These limitations
significantly hinder zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution weather
conditions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RobuSTereo}, a novel framework
that enhances the zero-shot generalization of stereo matching models under
adverse weather by addressing both data scarcity and feature extraction
challenges. First, we introduce a diffusion-based simulation pipeline with a
stereo consistency module, which generates high-quality stereo data tailored
for adverse conditions. By training stereo matching models on our synthetic
datasets, we reduce the domain gap between clean and degraded images,
significantly improving the models' robustness to unseen weather conditions.
The stereo consistency module ensures structural alignment across synthesized
image pairs, preserving geometric integrity and enhancing depth estimation
accuracy. Second, we design a robust feature encoder that combines a
specialized ConvNet with a denoising transformer to extract stable and reliable
features from degraded images. The ConvNet captures fine-grained local
structures, while the denoising transformer refines global representations,
effectively mitigating the impact of noise, low visibility, and weather-induced
distortions. This enables more accurate disparity estimation even under
challenging visual conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textbf{RobuSTereo} significantly improves the robustness and generalization of
stereo matching models across diverse adverse weather scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准标记化方法将特征限制在离散的网格中，阻碍了模型在稀疏场景中的潜力。

Method: 采用Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT)策略，通过连续定位标记和oracle-guided搜索优化标记位置。

Result: 实验表明，SPoT显著提升了性能，并大幅减少了推理时所需的标记数量。

Conclusion: SPoT为ViT架构提供了灵活、高效和可解释的新方向，将稀疏性转化为战略优势。

Abstract: Vision Transformers naturally accommodate sparsity, yet standard tokenization
methods confine features to discrete patch grids. This constraint prevents
models from fully exploiting sparse regimes, forcing awkward compromises. We
propose Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT), a novel tokenization strategy that
positions tokens continuously within images, effectively sidestepping
grid-based limitations. With our proposed oracle-guided search, we uncover
substantial performance gains achievable with ideal subpixel token positioning,
drastically reducing the number of tokens necessary for accurate predictions
during inference. SPoT provides a new direction for flexible, efficient, and
interpretable ViT architectures, redefining sparsity as a strategic advantage
rather than an imposed limitation.

Method: 通过大规模研究分析架构选择（如延迟融合、通道堆叠、空间到深度投影和交叉注意力）对导航训练中相对姿态估计器的影响。

Result: 发现模拟器设置对方法成功有影响，但能力可部分迁移到更真实场景；导航性能与相对姿态估计性能相关。

Conclusion: 端到端强化学习能部分解决图像目标导航任务，但模拟器设置和架构选择是关键因素。

Abstract: Image goal navigation requires two different skills: firstly, core navigation
skills, including the detection of free space and obstacles, and taking
decisions based on an internal representation; and secondly, computing
directional information by comparing visual observations to the goal image.
Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or
pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this
paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end
training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive
answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose
estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate
the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking,
space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence
of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success
of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings,
leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these
capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend.
We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and
probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进准确率，并成功扩展到4D微表情识别。

Conclusion: FACET-VLM为多模态面部表情识别提供了强大、可扩展且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) in 3D and 4D domains presents a
significant challenge in affective computing due to the complexity of spatial
and temporal facial dynamics. Its success is crucial for advancing applications
in human behavior understanding, healthcare monitoring, and human-computer
interaction. In this work, we propose FACET-VLM, a vision-language framework
for 3D/4D FER that integrates multiview facial representation learning with
semantic guidance from natural language prompts. FACET-VLM introduces three key
components: Cross-View Semantic Aggregation (CVSA) for view-consistent fusion,
Multiview Text-Guided Fusion (MTGF) for semantically aligned facial emotions,
and a multiview consistency loss to enforce structural coherence across views.
Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple benchmarks,
including BU-3DFE, Bosphorus, BU-4DFE, and BP4D-Spontaneous. We further extend
FACET-VLM to 4D micro-expression recognition (MER) on the 4DME dataset,
demonstrating strong performance in capturing subtle, short-lived emotional
cues. The extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and
substantial contributions of each individual component within the framework.
Overall, FACET-VLM offers a robust, extensible, and high-performing solution
for multimodal FER in both posed and spontaneous settings.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖固定假设（如预定义类别数量），难以处理现实数据的复杂性和变异性。

Method: 提出AdaGCD框架，结合自适应槽注意力（AdaSlot），动态确定最佳槽数量，灵活聚类未标记数据。

Result: 在公开和细粒度数据集上的实验验证了AdaGCD的有效性，特别是在利用空间局部信息方面。

Conclusion: AdaGCD通过自适应表示和动态槽分配，显著提升了开放世界场景中的类别发现能力。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) tackles the challenging problem of
categorizing unlabeled images into both known and novel classes within a
partially labeled dataset, without prior knowledge of the number of unknown
categories. Traditional methods often rely on rigid assumptions, such as
predefining the number of classes, which limits their ability to handle the
inherent variability and complexity of real-world data. To address these
shortcomings, we propose AdaGCD, a cluster-centric contrastive learning
framework that incorporates Adaptive Slot Attention (AdaSlot) into the GCD
framework. AdaSlot dynamically determines the optimal number of slots based on
data complexity, removing the need for predefined slot counts. This adaptive
mechanism facilitates the flexible clustering of unlabeled data into known and
novel categories by dynamically allocating representational capacity. By
integrating adaptive representation with dynamic slot allocation, our method
captures both instance-specific and spatially clustered features, improving
class discovery in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on public and
fine-grained datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework, emphasizing
the advantages of leveraging spatial local information for category discovery
in unlabeled image datasets.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在真实数据集上具有更高的检测精度和更快的处理速度。

Conclusion: 小波域指纹方法简化了流程，提升了性能，适用于图像取证和源识别。

Abstract: Camera fingerprint detection plays a crucial role in source identification
and image forensics, with wavelet denoising approaches proving to be
particularly effective in extracting sensor pattern noise (SPN). In this
article, we propose a modification to wavelet-based SPN extraction. Rather than
constructing the fingerprint as an image, we introduce the notion of a wavelet
domain fingerprint. This avoids the final inversion step of the denoising
algorithm and allows fingerprint comparisons to be made directly in the wavelet
domain. As such, our modification streamlines the extraction and comparison
process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method not only achieves higher detection accuracy but can also significantly
improve processing speed.

Motivation: 弱监督分割中仅部分像素有标签（涂鸦），现有方法使用硬伪标签无法表示类别不确定性或错误，因此提出软自标记以改进。

Method: 提出了一种基于软伪标签的辅助损失，系统地评估了标准和新CRF松弛形式（凸和非凸）、邻域系统及网络预测与软伪标签的连接项，并提出了一种通用的连续子问题求解器。

Result: 软自标记显著提升了基于涂鸦的训练效果，优于更复杂的专用WSSS系统，甚至可能优于全像素精确监督。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于其他弱监督问题/系统，展示了软自标记在弱监督分割中的潜力。

Abstract: We consider weakly supervised segmentation where only a fraction of pixels
have ground truth labels (scribbles) and focus on a self-labeling approach
optimizing relaxations of the standard unsupervised CRF/Potts loss on unlabeled
pixels. While WSSS methods can directly optimize such losses via gradient
descent, prior work suggests that higher-order optimization can improve network
training by introducing hidden pseudo-labels and powerful CRF sub-problem
solvers, e.g. graph cut. However, previously used hard pseudo-labels can not
represent class uncertainty or errors, which motivates soft self-labeling. We
derive a principled auxiliary loss and systematically evaluate standard and new
CRF relaxations (convex and non-convex), neighborhood systems, and terms
connecting network predictions with soft pseudo-labels. We also propose a
general continuous sub-problem solver. Using only standard architectures, soft
self-labeling consistently improves scribble-based training and outperforms
significantly more complex specialized WSSS systems. It can outperform full
pixel-precise supervision. Our general ideas apply to other weakly-supervised
problems/systems.

Conclusion: 剪枝与视觉模型的可解释性、表示学习和人类对齐之间存在复杂关系，需进一步研究其适用条件和方法。

Abstract: Pruning is widely used to reduce the complexity of deep learning models, but
its effects on interpretability and representation learning remain poorly
understood. This paper investigates how pruning influences vision models across
three key dimensions: (i) interpretability, (ii) unsupervised object discovery,
and (iii) alignment with human perception. We first analyze different vision
network architectures to examine how varying sparsity levels affect feature
attribution interpretability methods. Additionally, we explore whether pruning
promotes more succinct and structured representations, potentially improving
unsupervised object discovery by discarding redundant information while
preserving essential features. Finally, we assess whether pruning enhances the
alignment between model representations and human perception, investigating
whether sparser models focus on more discriminative features similarly to
humans. Our findings also reveal the presence of sweet spots, where sparse
models exhibit higher interpretability, downstream generalization and human
alignment. However, these spots highly depend on the network architectures and
their size in terms of trainable parameters. Our results suggest a complex
interplay between these three dimensions, highlighting the importance of
investigating when and how pruning benefits vision representations.

challenging task due to the difficulty of modeling detailed interaction
dynamics. Existing methods treat human and object motions independently,
resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In
this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation
as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At
the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics
model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To
further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that
mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading
optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training,
preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of
HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the
quality of generated interactions.

Result: DeRIS在精确分割和图像-文本理解方面表现优异，且能适应非参考和多参考场景。

Conclusion: DeRIS通过模块化设计和创新机制，有效解决了RIS任务中的认知瓶颈，提升了通用性。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a challenging task that aims to segment
objects in an image based on natural language expressions. While prior studies
have predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and
achieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental
bottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we propose DeRIS, a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key
components: perception and cognition. This modular decomposition facilitates a
systematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our
findings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual
deficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current
models. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which
enhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby
enabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text
comprehension. Additionally, we analyze and introduce a simple non-referent
sample conversion data augmentation to address the long-tail distribution issue
related to target existence judgement in general scenarios. Notably, DeRIS
demonstrates inherent adaptability to both non- and multi-referents scenarios
without requiring specialized architectural modifications, enhancing its
general applicability. The codes and models are available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于MAE预训练的ViT在3D医学图像分割中的应用，特别针对颅内动脉钙化（IAC）分割任务，展示了其优于传统监督方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D ViTs在医学图像分割中表现不佳，但其自监督训练（如MAE框架）可以避免昂贵的人工标注，适用于IAC等大规模医学影像分析。

Method: 通过MAE框架预训练ViT，并在IST-3临床试验数据上微调用于IAC分割，比较了不同patch大小和上采样方法的效果。

Result: 1) 自监督ViT比监督nnU-Net基线高3.2 Dice分数；2) 小patch和插值上采样效果更佳；3) ViT对高切片厚度更鲁棒，临床风险分类提升46%。

Conclusion: MAE预训练的ViT在IAC分割中表现出色，具有临床实用价值，代码已开源。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant popularity in the natural
image domain but have been less successful in 3D medical image segmentation.
Nevertheless, 3D ViTs are particularly interesting for large medical imaging
volumes due to their efficient self-supervised training within the masked
autoencoder (MAE) framework, which enables the use of imaging data without the
need for expensive manual annotations. intracranial arterial calcification
(IAC) is an imaging biomarker visible on routinely acquired CT scans linked to
neurovascular diseases such as stroke and dementia, and automated IAC
quantification could enable their large-scale risk assessment. We pre-train
ViTs with MAE and fine-tune them for IAC segmentation for the first time. To
develop our models, we use highly heterogeneous data from a large clinical
trial, the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). We evaluate key aspects of
MAE pre-trained ViTs in IAC segmentation, and analyse the clinical
implications. We show: 1) our calibrated self-supervised ViT beats a strong
supervised nnU-Net baseline by 3.2 Dice points, 2) low patch sizes are crucial
for ViTs for IAC segmentation and interpolation upsampling with regular
convolutions is preferable to transposed convolutions for ViT-based models, and
3) our ViTs increase robustness to higher slice thicknesses and improve risk
group classification in a clinical scenario by 46%. Our code is available
online.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰川冰量流失速度加快，需更准确的全年度监测方法以理解崩解过程，现有基于ImageNet预训练的模型因领域差异表现不佳。

Method: 提出两种自监督多模态预训练技术，利用新数据集SSL4SAR，并设计结合Swin Transformer编码器和残差CNN解码器的混合模型架构。

Result: 在CaFFe基准数据集上，新模型的平均距离误差为293米，优于之前最佳模型67米；集成模型误差降至75米，接近人类水平（38米）。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了冰川崩解前沿的季节性变化监测精度。

Abstract: Glaciers are losing ice mass at unprecedented rates, increasing the need for
accurate, year-round monitoring to understand frontal ablation, particularly
the factors driving the calving process. Deep learning models can extract
calving front positions from Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery to track seasonal
ice losses at the calving fronts of marine- and lake-terminating glaciers. The
current state-of-the-art model relies on ImageNet-pretrained weights. However,
they are suboptimal due to the domain shift between the natural images in
ImageNet and the specialized characteristics of remote sensing imagery, in
particular for Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. To address this challenge, we
propose two novel self-supervised multimodal pretraining techniques that
leverage SSL4SAR, a new unlabeled dataset comprising 9,563 Sentinel-1 and 14
Sentinel-2 images of Arctic glaciers, with one optical image per glacier in the
dataset. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid model architecture that
combines a Swin Transformer encoder with a residual Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) decoder. When pretrained on SSL4SAR, this model achieves a mean
distance error of 293 m on the "CAlving Fronts and where to Find thEm" (CaFFe)
benchmark dataset, outperforming the prior best model by 67 m. Evaluating an
ensemble of the proposed model on a multi-annotator study of the benchmark
dataset reveals a mean distance error of 75 m, approaching the human
performance of 38 m. This advancement enables precise monitoring of seasonal
changes in glacier calving fronts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于自回归的视觉生成模型在量化过程中会引入信息损失，而连续标记的建模又面临密度估计困难和生成异常的风险。

Method: DisCon框架将离散标记重新解释为条件信号，建模连续表示在离散标记条件下的概率。

Result: DisCon在ImageNet 256×256生成任务上取得了1.38的gFID分数，显著优于现有自回归方法。

Conclusion: DisCon通过结合离散和连续表示的优势，有效提升了图像生成的保真度和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interests in
encoding images as discrete tokens and leveraging autoregressive (AR)
frameworks for visual generation. However, the quantization process in AR-based
visual generation models inherently introduces information loss that degrades
image fidelity. To mitigate this limitation, recent studies have explored to
autoregressively predict continuous tokens. Unlike discrete tokens that reside
in a structured and bounded space, continuous representations exist in an
unbounded, high-dimensional space, making density estimation more challenging
and increasing the risk of generating out-of-distribution artifacts. Based on
the above findings, this work introduces DisCon (Discrete-Conditioned
Continuous Autoregressive Model), a novel framework that reinterprets discrete
tokens as conditional signals rather than generation targets. By modeling the
conditional probability of continuous representations conditioned on discrete
tokens, DisCon circumvents the optimization challenges of continuous token
modeling while avoiding the information loss caused by quantization. DisCon
achieves a gFID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 256$\times$256 generation,
outperforming state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches by a clear margin.

Motivation: 研究ViTs在医学影像中的表示是否具有语义意义，以及其对微小变化的脆弱性。

Method: 使用基于投影梯度的算法分析ViTs的表示。

Result: ViTs的表示缺乏语义意义，微小变化可导致分类准确率下降60%以上。

Conclusion: ViTs的表示在医学影像分类中存在根本性问题，对其在安全关键系统中的部署提出挑战。

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging
tasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their
superior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due
to their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they
are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the
representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this
paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their
representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently
vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have
very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to
different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such
vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example,
unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over
60\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically
demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT
representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical
challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.

Method: 采用高斯滤波和三种下采样方法构建多尺度样本，计算各尺度损失函数的梯度并取平均以确定对抗扰动。

Result: 实验表明，SGP显著提高了攻击成功率，平均提升2.3%至32.6%。

Conclusion: SGP是一种可扩展性强且易于集成的输入变换方法，显著提升了对抗样本的迁移性。

Abstract: The transferability of adversarial examples poses a significant security
challenge for deep neural networks, which can be attacked without knowing
anything about them. In this paper, we propose a new Segmented Gaussian Pyramid
(SGP) attack method to enhance the transferability, particularly against
defense models. Unlike existing methods that generally focus on single-scale
images, our approach employs Gaussian filtering and three types of downsampling
to construct a series of multi-scale examples. Then, the gradients of the loss
function with respect to each scale are computed, and their average is used to
determine the adversarial perturbations. The proposed SGP can be considered an
input transformation with high extensibility that is easily integrated into
most existing adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in
contrast to the state-of-the-art methods, SGP significantly enhances attack
success rates against black-box defense models, with average attack success
rates increasing by 2.3% to 32.6%, based only on transferability.

TL;DR: FreeLoRA是一个无需训练的框架，通过融合多个主题特定的LoRA模块实现多主题个性化图像生成。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在多主题个性化时需复杂调整或联合优化，FreeLoRA旨在简化这一过程。

Method: 采用Full Token Tuning策略训练主题特定LoRA模块，并在推理时使用Subject-Aware Inference激活对应模块。

Result: 实验表明FreeLoRA在主题保真度和提示一致性上表现优异。

Conclusion: FreeLoRA为多主题个性化提供了一种简单且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation plays a crucial role in applications such as
virtual try-on and poster design. Existing approaches typically fine-tune
pretrained generative models or apply LoRA-based adaptations for individual
subjects. However, these methods struggle with multi-subject personalization,
as combining independently adapted modules often requires complex re-tuning or
joint optimization. We present FreeLoRA, a simple and generalizable framework
that enables training-free fusion of subject-specific LoRA modules for
multi-subject personalization. Each LoRA module is adapted on a few images of a
specific subject using a Full Token Tuning strategy, where it is applied across
all tokens in the prompt to encourage weakly supervised token-content
alignment. At inference, we adopt Subject-Aware Inference, activating each
module only on its corresponding subject tokens. This enables training-free
fusion of multiple personalized subjects within a single image, while
mitigating overfitting and mutual interference between subjects. Extensive
experiments show that FreeLoRA achieves strong performance in both subject
fidelity and prompt consistency.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效确保模型发展合理的推理路径并表现更优。

Conclusion: HCNQA通过分层监督改善了3D VQA模型的推理路径和性能。

Abstract: 3D Visual Question-Answering (3D VQA) is pivotal for models to perceive the
physical world and perform spatial reasoning. Answer-centric supervision is a
commonly used training method for 3D VQA models. Many models that utilize this
strategy have achieved promising results in 3D VQA tasks. However, the
answer-centric approach only supervises the final output of models and allows
models to develop reasoning pathways freely. The absence of supervision on the
reasoning pathway enables the potential for developing superficial shortcuts
through common patterns in question-answer pairs. Moreover, although
slow-thinking methods advance large language models, they suffer from
underthinking. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{HCNQA}, a 3D VQA
model leveraging a hierarchical concentration narrowing supervision method. By
mimicking the human process of gradually focusing from a broad area to specific
objects while searching for answers, our method guides the model to perform
three phases of concentration narrowing through hierarchical supervision. By
supervising key checkpoints on a general reasoning pathway, our method can
ensure the development of a rational and effective reasoning pathway. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively ensure that
the model develops a rational reasoning pathway and performs better. The code

Motivation: 现有研究通常仅依赖基础模型的预测误差，未考虑长尾轨迹模式的多样性和不确定性，导致对复杂和危险场景的预测能力不足。

Method: 结合改进的动量对比学习（MoCo-DT）和解耦对比学习（DCL）模块，设计四种轨迹随机增强方法和在线迭代聚类策略。

Result: 在nuScenes和ETH/UCY数据集上，AMD在长尾轨迹预测和整体预测精度上均表现优异。

Conclusion: AMD框架有效提升了模型对长尾轨迹的识别能力，同时保持了高预测精度。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the future trajectories of traffic agents is essential
in autonomous driving. However, due to the inherent imbalance in trajectory
distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and
hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's
prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of
long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled
contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and
supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum
contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module,
our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex
trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random
augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy,
allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the
distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to
define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on
the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only
achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also
demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Hyperspectral reconstruction (HSR) from RGB images is a fundamentally
ill-posed problem due to severe spectral information loss. Existing approaches
typically rely on a single RGB image, limiting reconstruction accuracy. In this
work, we propose a novel multi-image-to-hyperspectral reconstruction (MI-HSR)
framework that leverages a triple-camera smartphone system, where two lenses
are equipped with carefully selected spectral filters. Our configuration,
grounded in theoretical and empirical analysis, enables richer and more diverse
spectral observations than conventional single-camera setups. To support this
new paradigm, we introduce Doomer, the first dataset for MI-HSR, comprising
aligned images from three smartphone cameras and a hyperspectral reference
camera across diverse scenes. We show that the proposed HSR model achieves
consistent improvements over existing methods on the newly proposed benchmark.
In a nutshell, our setup allows 30% towards more accurately estimated spectra
compared to an ordinary RGB camera. Our findings suggest that multi-view
spectral filtering with commodity hardware can unlock more accurate and
practical hyperspectral imaging solutions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep neural networks have driven significant progress

Abstract: Object-centric slot attention is an emerging paradigm for unsupervised
learning of structured, interpretable object-centric representations (slots).
This enables effective reasoning about objects and events at a low
computational cost and is thus applicable to critical healthcare applications,
such as real-time interpretation of surgical video. The heterogeneous scenes in
real-world applications like surgery are, however, difficult to parse into a
meaningful set of slots. Current approaches with an adaptive slot count perform
well on images, but their performance on surgical videos is low. To address
this challenge, we propose a dynamic temporal slot transformer (DTST) module
that is trained both for temporal reasoning and for predicting the optimal
future slot initialization. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multiple surgical databases, demonstrating that unsupervised object-centric
methods can be applied to real-world data and become part of the common arsenal
in healthcare applications.

Conclusion: SPRED通过自增强循环设计，有效提升了未标记数据的利用和长期学习性能。

Abstract: Current lifelong person re-identification (LReID) methods predominantly rely
on fully labeled data streams. However, in real-world scenarios where
annotation resources are limited, a vast amount of unlabeled data coexists with
scarce labeled samples, leading to the Semi-Supervised LReID (Semi-LReID)
problem where LReID methods suffer severe performance degradation. Existing
LReID methods, even when combined with semi-supervised strategies, suffer from
limited long-term adaptation performance due to struggling with the noisy
knowledge occurring during unlabeled data utilization. In this paper, we
pioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing
Prototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key
innovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic
prototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative
purification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data. Specifically,
learnable identity prototypes are introduced to dynamically capture the
identity distributions and generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Then, the
dual-knowledge cooperation scheme integrates current model specialization and
historical model generalization, refining noisy pseudo-labels. Through this
cyclic design, reliable pseudo-labels are progressively mined to improve
current-stage learning and ensure positive knowledge propagation over long-term
learning. Experiments on the established Semi-LReID benchmarks show that our
SPRED achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our source code is available at

Method: 提出Reason50K数据集和ReasonBrain框架，结合多模态大语言模型和扩散模型，并引入细粒度推理线索提取模块（FRCE）和跨模态增强器（CME）。

Result: ReasonBrain在推理场景中表现优于现有基线，并在传统指令图像编辑任务中展现零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Reason50K和ReasonBrain为复杂指令推理图像编辑提供了有效解决方案，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing (IIE) has advanced rapidly with the success
of diffusion models. However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and
explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting,
moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit
hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible
visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited
support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities.
Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail
extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we
propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and
evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with
ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit
hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K
samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and
Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis,
incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture
detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction
reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal
Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and
MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios
while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks. Our
dataset and code will be released publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实施DIR需要基于体素的空间精度指标，如手动标记的地标，但对于高度移动的GI器官难以实现。因此，研究旨在通过DT模拟真实运动来评估DIR的准确性。

Method: 通过半自动化管道，从静态3D患者扫描生成21个运动阶段的4D序列，模拟GI运动。使用六种DIR方法，通过目标配准误差、Dice相似系数和Hausdorff距离等指标评估性能，并验证剂量映射的准确性。

Result: 生成的DT模拟了真实的GI运动，运动幅度和Jacobian行列式与真实患者数据相似。管道提供了详细的DIR性能指标和剂量映射验证。

Conclusion: 该管道为动态复杂解剖区域的DIR工具提供了严格的测试方法，实现了空间和剂量精度的详细评估。

Abstract: Objective: Clinical implementation of deformable image registration (DIR)
requires voxel-based spatial accuracy metrics such as manually identified
landmarks, which are challenging to implement for highly mobile
gastrointestinal (GI) organs. To address this, patient-specific digital twins
(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of
DIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D
sequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published
analytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,
including six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,
and three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were
assessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from
independent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six
different DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity
coefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics
and voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans
from patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were
warped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of
DIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error
estimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling
realistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean
log Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to
published real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of
detailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose
mapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR
tools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and
dosimetric accuracies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多季节信息融合框架，结合休眠期和生长期的RGB-D图像，用于果园自动化管理，提升机器视觉系统在密集树冠下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 果园自动化中，生长期的密集树冠严重遮挡树干和树枝结构，限制了机器视觉系统的能力，而休眠期树冠结构更开放可见。

Method: 使用YOLOv9-Seg进行实例分割，Kinect Fusion进行3D重建，Fast GICP进行模型对齐，整合多季节数据。

Result: YOLOv9-Seg在休眠期数据集上表现优异（MSE 0.0047，mAP@50 0.78），Kinect Fusion重建精度高（RMSE 5.23 mm树干直径），Fast GICP实现跨季节精确对齐（最小适应度0.00197）。

Conclusion: 融合多季节结构数据克服了生长期遮挡问题，提升了果园自动化操作的精确性。

Abstract: In orchard automation, dense foliage during the canopy season severely
occludes tree structures, minimizing visibility to various canopy parts such as
trunks and branches, which limits the ability of a machine vision system.
However, canopy structure is more open and visible during the dormant season
when trees are defoliated. In this work, we present an information fusion
framework that integrates multi-seasonal structural data to support robotic and
automated crop load management during the entire growing season. The framework
combines high-resolution RGB-D imagery from both dormant and canopy periods
using YOLOv9-Seg for instance segmentation, Kinect Fusion for 3D
reconstruction, and Fast Generalized Iterative Closest Point (Fast GICP) for
model alignment. Segmentation outputs from YOLOv9-Seg were used to extract
depth-informed masks, which enabled accurate 3D point cloud reconstruction via
Kinect Fusion; these reconstructed models from each season were subsequently
aligned using Fast GICP to achieve spatially coherent multi-season fusion. The
YOLOv9-Seg model, trained on manually annotated images, achieved a mean squared
error (MSE) of 0.0047 and segmentation mAP@50 scores up to 0.78 for trunks in
dormant season dataset. Kinect Fusion enabled accurate reconstruction of tree
geometry, validated with field measurements resulting in root mean square
errors (RMSE) of 5.23 mm for trunk diameter, 4.50 mm for branch diameter, and
13.72 mm for branch spacing. Fast GICP achieved precise cross-seasonal
registration with a minimum fitness score of 0.00197, allowing integrated,
comprehensive tree structure modeling despite heavy occlusions during the
growing season. This fused structural representation enables robotic systems to
access otherwise obscured architectural information, improving the precision of
pruning, thinning, and other automated orchard operations.

TL;DR: IC-Custom是一个统一的图像定制框架，通过上下文学习整合位置感知和无位置定制，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像定制方法缺乏通用框架，限制了多样化应用。

Method: 提出IC-Custom框架，利用DiT的多模态注意力机制和ICMA机制，结合高质量数据集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，人类偏好提升73%，仅训练0.4%参数。

Conclusion: IC-Custom为工业应用提供了高效、通用的图像定制解决方案。

Abstract: Image customization, a crucial technique for industrial media production,
aims to generate content that is consistent with reference images. However,
current approaches conventionally separate image customization into
position-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal
framework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified
framework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image
customization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference
images with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal
attention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the
In-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented
register tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to
correctly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in
polyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a
high-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world
sources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and
over-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial
applications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and
creative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench
and the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly
outperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art
open-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human
preference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment
metrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多层感知机（MLPs）在视觉任务中的应用，并通过事件驱动机制优化计算性能。

Method: 提出evMLP模型，利用事件驱动机制选择性处理图像或特征图中的变化区域，避免冗余计算。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中表现优异，视频数据集上显著降低计算成本，同时保持输出一致性。

Conclusion: evMLP通过事件驱动机制在保持性能的同时提升了计算效率，为视觉模型架构提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results in computer vision
tasks. In the early days, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were the
mainstream architecture. In recent years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
become increasingly popular. In addition, exploring applications of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) has provided new perspectives for research into vision model
architectures. In this paper, we present evMLP accompanied by a simple
event-driven local update mechanism. The proposed evMLP can independently
process patches on images or feature maps via MLPs. We define changes between
consecutive frames as "events". Under the event-driven local update mechanism,
evMLP selectively processes patches where events occur. For sequential image
data (e.g., video processing), this approach improves computational performance
by avoiding redundant computations. Through ImageNet image classification
experiments, evMLP attains accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art models.
More significantly, experimental results on multiple video datasets demonstrate
that evMLP reduces computational cost via its event-driven local update
mechanism while maintaining output consistency with its non-event-driven
baseline. The code and trained models are available at

Motivation: 现有公共数据集主要由孤立的文本-视频对组成，无法支持连贯多场景视频序列的建模。

Method: 提出CI-VID数据集，包含34万多个样本，每个样本包含连贯的视频片段序列和文本描述，支持文本和视频到视频的生成。

Result: 实验表明，使用CI-VID训练的模型在生成视频序列时，准确性和内容一致性显著提升。

Conclusion: CI-VID数据集为故事驱动内容的生成提供了高质量支持，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has recently attracted considerable attention,
resulting in the development of numerous high-quality datasets that have
propelled progress in this area. However, existing public datasets are
primarily composed of isolated text-video (T-V) pairs and thus fail to support
the modeling of coherent multi-clip video sequences. To address this
limitation, we introduce CI-VID, a dataset that moves beyond isolated
text-to-video (T2V) generation toward text-and-video-to-video (TV2V)
generation, enabling models to produce coherent, multi-scene video sequences.
CI-VID contains over 340,000 samples, each featuring a coherent sequence of
video clips with text captions that capture both the individual content of each
clip and the transitions between them, enabling visually and textually grounded
generation. To further validate the effectiveness of CI-VID, we design a
comprehensive, multi-dimensional benchmark incorporating human evaluation,
VLM-based assessment, and similarity-based metrics. Experimental results
demonstrate that models trained on CI-VID exhibit significant improvements in
both accuracy and content consistency when generating video sequences. This
facilitates the creation of story-driven content with smooth visual transitions
and strong temporal coherence, underscoring the quality and practical utility
of the CI-VID dataset We release the CI-VID dataset and the accompanying code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长动画色彩化在动画产业中成本高昂，现有研究局限于短时色彩化且忽视全局信息，无法保持长期色彩一致性。

Method: 提出LongAnimation框架，包括SketchDiT、动态全局-局部记忆模块（DGLM）和色彩一致性奖励机制，动态融合全局历史特征与当前生成特征。

Result: 在短时（14帧）和长时（平均500帧）动画上实验验证了LongAnimation在保持色彩一致性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: LongAnimation通过动态全局-局部范式显著提升了长动画色彩化的色彩一致性，为开放域动画色彩化任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry
production. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore,
automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has
significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term
colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features
to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local
paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color
consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can
be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically
extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.
Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly
includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color
Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support
the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to
dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with
the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce
a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency
fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both
short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the
effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color
consistency for open-domain animation colorization task. The code can be found

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在静态图像上表现优异，但在动态、信息密集的短视频理解上不足，Kwai Keye-VL旨在填补这一空白。

Conclusion: Kwai Keye-VL在短视频理解上表现卓越，同时具备通用视觉语言能力，为实际应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities on static images, they often fall short in comprehending dynamic,
information-dense short-form videos, a dominant medium in today's digital
landscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an
8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge
performance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust
general-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on
two core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens
with a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe
features a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,
followed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first
post-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction
following, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In
this second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data
mixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think
with image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to
decide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and
alignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct
abnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach,
we conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves
state-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly
competitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop
and release the \textbf{KC-MMBench}, a new benchmark tailored for real-world
short-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练扩散模型的微调，受限于时间和语义/布局差异，FreeMorph旨在解决这些问题，提供无需实例训练的高保真图像变形。

Method: 1) 提出指导感知的球面插值设计，通过修改自注意力模块解决身份丢失问题；2) 引入步进式变化趋势，混合输入图像的自注意力模块以实现可控过渡。

Result: FreeMorph在图像变形任务中表现优于现有方法，速度提升10~50倍，并达到新的最优水平。

Conclusion: FreeMorph通过创新的设计解决了无需调优图像变形的挑战，为高质量变形提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present FreeMorph, the first tuning-free method for image morphing that
accommodates inputs with different semantics or layouts. Unlike existing
methods that rely on finetuning pre-trained diffusion models and are limited by
time constraints and semantic/layout discrepancies, FreeMorph delivers
high-fidelity image morphing without requiring per-instance training. Despite
their efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods face challenges in
maintaining high-quality results due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step
denoising process and biases inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model. In
this paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating
two key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical
interpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images
by modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and
ensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We
further introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention
modules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent
transitions that respect both inputs. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate
that FreeMorph outperforms existing methods, being 10x ~ 50x faster and
establishing a new state-of-the-art for image morphing.

Conclusion: 多模态基础模型在视觉任务中表现出一定的通用性，但仍需改进几何任务和提示敏感性。

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable
progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of
understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular
multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0
Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision
tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and
surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and
its variants, etc).
  The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to
output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or
3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at
an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these
challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable
and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized
benchmarking framework.
  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art
specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists;
this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based
tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4)
While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit
less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among
non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6)
reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a
preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest
GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial
misalignments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) accelerates autoregressive image generation by introducing flexible parallelization and locality-aware ordering, reducing steps significantly without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autoregressive image generation is memory-bound and slow; existing parallelization methods are limited. LPD aims to achieve high parallelization while maintaining quality.

Method: LPD uses Flexible Parallelized Autoregressive Modeling (learnable position queries for arbitrary generation) and Locality-aware Generation Ordering (grouping to minimize dependencies).

Result: Reduces generation steps from 256 to 20 (256x256) and 1024 to 48 (512x512) with no quality loss, achieving 3.4x lower latency.

Conclusion: LPD effectively balances parallelization and quality, significantly accelerating autoregressive image generation.

Abstract: We present Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) to accelerate
autoregressive image generation. Traditional autoregressive image generation
relies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high
latency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by
shifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved
limited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining
generation quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized
Autoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation
ordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query
tokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility
among concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2)
Locality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to
minimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing
generation quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256
to 20 (256$\times$256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512$\times$512 res.) without
compromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and
achieving at least 3.4$\times$ lower latency than previous parallelized
autoregressive models.

Abstract: Deep Recommender Models (DLRMs) inference is a fundamental AI workload
accounting for more than 79% of the total AI workload in Meta's data centers.
DLRMs' performance bottleneck is found in the embedding layers, which perform
many random memory accesses to retrieve small embedding vectors from tables of
various sizes. We propose the design of tailored data flows to speedup
embedding look-ups. Namely, we propose four strategies to look up an embedding
table effectively on one core, and a framework to automatically map the tables
asymmetrically to the multiple cores of a SoC. We assess the effectiveness of
our method using the Huawei Ascend AI accelerators, comparing it with the
default Ascend compiler, and we perform high-level comparisons with Nvidia
A100. Results show a speed-up varying from 1.5x up to 6.5x for real workload
distributions, and more than 20x for extremely unbalanced distributions.
Furthermore, the method proves to be much more independent of the query
distribution than the baseline.

Abstract: Efficient workload scheduling is a critical challenge in modern heterogeneous
computing environments, particularly in high-performance computing (HPC)
systems. Traditional software-based schedulers struggle to efficiently balance
workload distribution due to high scheduling overhead, lack of adaptability to
dynamic workloads, and suboptimal resource utilization. These pitfalls are
compounded in heterogeneous systems, where differing computational elements can
have vastly different performance profiles. To resolve these hindrances, we
present a novel FPGA-based accelerator for stochastic online scheduling (SOS).
We modify a greedy cost selection assignment policy by adapting existing cost
equations to engage with discretized time before implementing them into a
hardware accelerator design. Our design leverages hardware parallelism,
precalculation, and precision quantization to reduce job scheduling latency. By
introducing a hardware-accelerated approach to real-time scheduling, this paper
establishes a new paradigm for adaptive scheduling mechanisms in heterogeneous
computing systems. The proposed design achieves high throughput, low latency,
and energy-efficient operation, offering a scalable alternative to traditional
software scheduling methods. Experimental results demonstrate consistent
workload distribution, fair machine utilization, and up to 1060x speedup over
single-threaded software scheduling policy implementations. This makes the SOS
accelerator a strong candidate for deployment in high-performance computing
system, deeplearning pipelines, and other performance-critical applications.

Abstract: Scientific simulation leveraging high-performance computing (HPC) systems is
crucial for modeling complex systems and phenomena in fields such as

that often reach petabyte to exabyte scales. However, managing these vast data
volumes introduces significant I/O and network bottlenecks, limiting practical

ratios by capturing complex data correlations, their integration into HPC
workflows poses substantial challenges due to the hybrid non-neural and neural

sequential stalls, and limited adaptability to varying data sizes and workloads
in existing hardware platforms. To overcome these challenges and push the limit
of high-performance scientific computing, we for the first time propose FLARE,
a dataflow-aware and scalable hardware architecture for neural-hybrid
scientific lossy compression. FLARE minimizes off-chip data access, reduces
bubble overhead through efficient dataflow, and adopts a modular design that
provides both scalability and flexibility, significantly enhancing throughput
and energy efficiency on modern HPC systems. Particularly, the proposed FLARE
achieves runtime speedups ranging from $3.50 \times$ to $96.07 \times$, and
energy efficiency improvements ranging from $24.51 \times$ to $520.68 \times$,
across various datasets and hardware platforms.

Abstract: Organizations around the world schedule jobs (programs) regularly to perform
various tasks dictated by their end users. With the major movement towards
using a cloud computing infrastructure, our organization follows a hybrid
approach with both cloud and on-prem servers. The objective of this work is to
perform capacity planning, i.e., estimate resource requirements, and job
scheduling for on-prem grid computing environments. A key contribution of our
approach is handling uncertainty in both resource usage and duration of the
jobs, a critical aspect in the finance industry where stochastic market
conditions significantly influence job characteristics. For capacity planning
and scheduling, we simultaneously balance two conflicting objectives: (a)
minimize resource usage, and (b) provide high quality-of-service to the end
users by completing jobs by their requested deadlines. We propose approximate
approaches using deterministic estimators and pair sampling-based constraint
programming. Our best approach (pair sampling-based) achieves much lower peak
resource usage compared to manual scheduling without compromising on the
quality-of-service.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分散是移动代理分布式计算中的基本任务，其复杂性源于匿名性和有限内存下的本地协调挑战。目标是优化分散时间和内存需求。

Method: 基于一种新颖的技术，构建匿名图中的端口一树。

Result: 在异步设置下实现了最优O(k)时间复杂度和O(log(k+Δ))位内存的分散算法。

Conclusion: 本文填补了异步设置下的复杂度空白，提出的端口一树技术可能具有独立的研究价值。

Abstract: We study the dispersion problem in anonymous port-labeled graphs: $k \leq n$
mobile agents, each with a unique ID and initially located arbitrarily on the
nodes of an $n$-node graph with maximum degree $\Delta$, must autonomously
relocate so that no node hosts more than one agent. Dispersion serves as a
fundamental task in distributed computing of mobile agents, and its complexity
stems from key challenges in local coordination under anonymity and limited
memory.
  The goal is to minimize both the time to achieve dispersion and the memory
required per agent. It is known that any algorithm requires $\Omega(k)$ time in
the worst case, and $\Omega(\log k)$ bits of memory per agent. A recent result
[SPAA'25] gives an optimal $O(k)$-time algorithm in the synchronous setting and
an $O(k \log k)$-time algorithm in the asynchronous setting, both using
$O(\log(k+\Delta))$ bits.
  In this paper, we close the complexity gap in the asynchronous setting by
presenting the first dispersion algorithm that runs in optimal $O(k)$ time
using $O(\log(k+\Delta))$ bits of memory per agent. Our solution is based on a
novel technique we develop in this paper that constructs a port-one tree in
anonymous graphs, which may be of independent interest.

Motivation: 解决在多租户边缘设备上高效部署LLM时面临的适配器选择复杂性和内存开销问题。

Method: 引入EdgeLoRA系统，包含自适应适配器选择、异构内存管理和批量LoRA推理三项创新。

Result: 实验表明，EdgeLoRA在延迟和吞吐量上显著优于现有方案，吞吐量提升4倍，同时支持更多适配器。

Conclusion: EdgeLoRA为资源受限环境中的LLM边缘部署提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their
versatility across a wide array of applications. Fine-tuning LLMs with
parameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these
models to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining.
Deploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial
benefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized
responses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge
devices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter
selection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter
swapping. Moreover, given the multiple requests in multi-tenant settings,
processing requests sequentially results in underutilization of computational
resources and increased latency. This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient
system for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA
incorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism
to streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory
management, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate
memory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient
batch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive
evaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly
outperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and
throughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times
boost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of
magnitude more adapters simultaneously. These results highlight EdgeLoRA's
potential to transform edge deployment of LLMs in multi-tenant scenarios,
offering a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained
environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new decentralized framework, named EDGChain-E
(Encrypted-Data-Git Chain for Energy), designed to manage version-controlled,
encrypted energy data using blockchain and the InterPlanetary File System. The
framework incorporates a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to
orchestrate collaborative data governance across the lifecycle of energy
research and operations, such as smart grid monitoring, demand forecasting, and
peer-to-peer energy trading. In EDGChain-E, initial commits capture the full
encrypted datasets-such as smart meter readings or grid telemetry-while
subsequent updates are tracked as encrypted Git patches, ensuring integrity,
traceability, and privacy. This versioning mechanism supports secure
collaboration across multiple stakeholders (e.g., utilities, researchers,
regulators) without compromising sensitive or regulated information. We
highlight the framework's capability to maintain FAIR-compliant (Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) provenance of encrypted data. By embedding
hash-based content identifiers in Merkle trees, the system enables transparent,
auditable, and immutable tracking of data changes, thereby supporting
reproducibility and trust in decentralized energy applications.

Abstract: The Alps Research Infrastructure leverages GH200 technology at scale,
featuring 10,752 GPUs. Accessing Alps provides a significant computational
advantage for researchers in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML). While Alps serves a broad range of scientific communities, traditional
HPC services alone are not sufficient to meet the dynamic needs of the ML
community. This paper presents an initial investigation into extending HPC
service capabilities to better support ML workloads. We identify key challenges
and gaps we have observed since the early-access phase (2023) of Alps by the
Swiss AI community and propose several technological enhancements. These
include a user environment designed to facilitate the adoption of HPC for ML
workloads, balancing performance with flexibility; a utility for rapid
performance screening of ML applications during development; observability
capabilities and data products for inspecting ongoing large-scale ML workloads;
a utility to simplify the vetting of allocated nodes for compute readiness; a
service plane infrastructure to deploy various types of workloads, including
support and inference services; and a storage infrastructure tailored to the
specific needs of ML workloads. These enhancements aim to facilitate the
execution of ML workloads on HPC systems, increase system usability and
resilience, and better align with the needs of the ML community. We also
discuss our current approach to security aspects. This paper concludes by
placing these proposals in the broader context of changes in the communities
served by HPC infrastructure like ours.

TL;DR: CarbonClarity是一个概率框架，用于建模半导体供应链中的隐含碳足迹不确定性，帮助设计者做出更明智的碳感知决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性模型无法捕捉半导体供应链的时空变异性，缺乏不确定性建模限制了碳感知设计的能力。

Method: 引入CarbonClarity框架，通过分布建模能量、气体、良率和碳强度等参数的不确定性，分析设计选择对排放的影响。

Result: 7nm技术节点的隐含碳足迹均值与95百分位差距可达1.6倍；芯片技术和成熟节点可降低不确定性，减少18%的95百分位排放。

Conclusion: CarbonClarity为系统设计提供了碳感知工具，芯片技术和成熟节点能显著降低排放及其不确定性。

Abstract: Embodied carbon footprint modeling has become an area of growing interest due
to its significant contribution to carbon emissions in computing. However, the
deterministic nature of the existing models fail to account for the spatial and
temporal variability in the semiconductor supply chain. The absence of
uncertainty modeling limits system designers' ability to make informed,
carbon-aware decisions. We introduce CarbonClarity, a probabilistic framework
designed to model embodied carbon footprints through distributions that reflect
uncertainties in energy-per-area, gas-per-area, yield, and carbon intensity
across different technology nodes. Our framework enables a deeper understanding
of how design choices, such as chiplet architectures and new vs. old technology
node selection, impact emissions and their associated uncertainties. For
example, we show that the gap between the mean and 95th percentile of embodied
carbon per cm$^2$ can reach up to 1.6X for the 7nm technology node.
Additionally, we demonstrate through case studies that: (i) CarbonClarity is a
valuable resource for device provisioning, help maintaining performance under a
tight carbon budget; and (ii) chiplet technology and mature nodes not only
reduce embodied carbon but also significantly lower its associated uncertainty,
achieving an 18% reduction in the 95th percentile compared to monolithic
designs for the mobile application.

Motivation: Stable Diffusion模型在生成高质量图像时存在高计算和内存需求的问题，限制了推理速度和能效。

Method: 提出SD-Acc框架，包括算法层面的自适应相位感知采样策略和硬件层面的高效数据流设计，以优化计算和内存访问。

Conclusion: SD-Acc通过算法与硬件协同优化，有效解决了Stable Diffusion模型的计算和内存瓶颈，为下一代多模态算法提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of diffusion models has significantly advanced generative AI,
improving the quality, realism, and creativity of image and video generation.
Among them, Stable Diffusion (StableDiff) stands out as a key model for
text-to-image generation and a foundation for next-generation multi-modal
algorithms. However, its high computational and memory demands hinder inference
speed and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we identify three
core issues: (1) intensive and often redundant computations, (2) heterogeneous
operations involving convolutions and attention mechanisms, and (3) diverse
weight and activation sizes.
  We present SD-Acc, a novel algorithm and hardware co-optimization framework.
At the algorithm level, we observe that high-level features in certain
denoising phases show significant similarity, enabling approximate computation.
Leveraging this, we propose an adaptive, phase-aware sampling strategy that
reduces compute and memory loads. This framework automatically balances image
quality and complexity based on the StableDiff model and user requirements. At
the hardware level, we design an address-centric dataflow to efficiently handle
heterogeneous operations within a simple systolic array. We address the
bottleneck of nonlinear functions via a two-stage streaming architecture and a
reconfigurable vector processing unit. Additionally, we implement adaptive
dataflow optimizations by combining dynamic reuse and operator fusion tailored
to StableDiff workloads, significantly reducing memory access. Across multiple
StableDiff models, our method achieves up to a 3x reduction in computational
demand without compromising image quality. Combined with our optimized hardware
accelerator, SD-Acc delivers higher speed and energy efficiency than
traditional CPU and GPU implementations.

Motivation: 解决高维非线性函数全局优化的挑战，尤其是在存在舍入误差时仍能保证结果的准确性。

Method: 采用区间分析和GPU并行计算，结合单程序单数据并行编程风格和变量循环技术，以减少计算成本。

Result: 成功在多达10,000维的10个多模态基准测试函数（如Ackley、Griewank等）中找到了全局最小值，远超文献报道的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证结果准确性的同时，显著提升了计算效率，适用于大规模非线性函数的全局优化问题。

Abstract: This paper introduces a GPU-based complete search method to enclose the
global minimum of a nonlinear function subject to simple bounds on the
variables. Using interval analysis, coupled with the computational power and
architecture of GPU, the method iteratively rules out the regions in the search
domain where the global minimum cannot exist and leaves a finite set of regions
where the global minimum must exist. For effectiveness, because of the rigor of
interval analysis, the method is guaranteed to enclose the global minimum of
the nonlinear function even in the presence of rounding errors. For efficiency,
the method employs a novel GPU-based single program, single data parallel
programming style to circumvent major GPU performance bottlenecks, and a
variable cycling technique is also integrated into the method to reduce
computational cost when minimizing large-scale nonlinear functions. The method
is validated by minimizing 10 multimodal benchmark test functions with scalable
dimensions, including the well-known Ackley function, Griewank function, Levy
function, and Rastrigin function. These benchmark test functions represent
grand challenges of global optimization, and enclosing the guaranteed global
minimum of these benchmark test functions with more than 80 dimensions has not
been reported in the literature. Our method completely searches the feasible
domain and successfully encloses the guaranteed global minimum of these 10
benchmark test functions with up to 10,000 dimensions using only one GPU in a
reasonable computation time, far exceeding the reported results in the
literature due to the unique method design and implementation based on GPU
architecture.

Abstract: Censorship resilience is a fundamental assumption underlying the security of
blockchain protocols. Additionally, the analysis of blockchain security from an
economic and game theoretic perspective has been growing in popularity in
recent years. In this work, we present a surprising rational censorship attack
on blockchain censorship resilience when we adopt the analysis of blockchain
security from a game theoretic lens and assume all users are rational. In our
attack, a colluding group with sufficient voting power censors the remainder
nodes such that the group alone can gain all the rewards from maintaining the
blockchain. We show that if nodes are rational, coordinating this attack just
requires a public read and write blackboard and we formally model the attack
using a game theoretic framework. Furthermore, we note that to ensure the
success of the attack, nodes need to know the total true voting power held by
the colluding group. We prove that the strategy to join the rational censorship
attack and also for nodes to honestly declare their power is a subgame perfect
equilibrium in the corresponding extensive form game induced by our attack.
Finally, we discuss the implications of the attack on blockchain users and
protocol designers as well as some potential countermeasures.

Abstract: Deep learning offers transformative potential in medical imaging, yet its
clinical adoption is frequently hampered by challenges such as data scarcity,
distribution shifts, and the need for robust task generalization. Prompt-based

Abstract: The use of deep learning (DL) in medical image analysis has significantly
improved the ability to predict lung cancer. In this study, we introduce a
novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model, named ResNet+, which is
based on the established ResNet framework. This model is specifically designed
to improve the prediction of lung cancer and diseases using the images. To
address the challenge of missing feature information that occurs during the
downsampling process in CNNs, we integrate the ResNet-D module, a variant
designed to enhance feature extraction capabilities by modifying the
downsampling layers, into the traditional ResNet model. Furthermore, a
convolutional attention module was incorporated into the bottleneck layers to
enhance model generalization by allowing the network to focus on relevant
regions of the input images. We evaluated the proposed model using five public
datasets, comprising lung cancer (LC2500 $n$=3183, IQ-OTH/NCCD $n$=1336, and
LCC $n$=25000 images) and lung disease (ChestXray $n$=5856, and COVIDx-CT
$n$=425024 images). To address class imbalance, we used data augmentation
techniques to artificially increase the representation of underrepresented
classes in the training dataset. The experimental results show that ResNet+
model demonstrated remarkable accuracy/F1, reaching 98.14/98.14\% on the
LC25000 dataset and 99.25/99.13\% on the IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset. Furthermore, the
ResNet+ model saved computational cost compared to the original ResNet series
in predicting lung cancer images. The proposed model outperformed the baseline
models on publicly available datasets, achieving better performance metrics.

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，SWinMamba能生成完整且连续的血管分割结果。

Conclusion: SWinMamba通过创新建模血管连续性，显著提升了血管分割的准确性。

Abstract: Vascular segmentation in medical images is crucial for disease diagnosis and
surgical navigation. However, the segmented vascular structure is often
discontinuous due to its slender nature and inadequate prior modeling. In this
paper, we propose a novel Serpentine Window Mamba (SWinMamba) to achieve
accurate vascular segmentation. The proposed SWinMamba innovatively models the
continuity of slender vascular structures by incorporating serpentine window
sequences into bidirectional state space models. The serpentine window
sequences enable efficient feature capturing by adaptively guiding global
visual context modeling to the vascular structure. Specifically, the Serpentine
Window Tokenizer (SWToken) adaptively splits the input image using overlapping
serpentine window sequences, enabling flexible receptive fields (RFs) for
vascular structure modeling. The Bidirectional Aggregation Module (BAM)
integrates coherent local features in the RFs for vascular continuity
representation. In addition, dual-domain learning with Spatial-Frequency Fusion
Unit (SFFU) is designed to enhance the feature representation of vascular
structure. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that
the proposed SWinMamba achieves superior performance with complete and
connected vessels.

Motivation: MR图像存在强度不均匀性，影响诊断和分析，现有深度学习方法忽视结构和偏置场平滑性约束，导致校正结果失真。

Method: 提出S2DNets，引入分段结构约束和偏置场平滑性约束，自监督校正偏置场。

Result: 在临床和模拟MR数据集上表现优于传统和深度学习方法，下游分割任务验证其有效性。

Conclusion: S2DNets能有效去除不均匀强度并保留结构细节，提升MR图像质量。

Abstract: MR imaging techniques are of great benefit to disease diagnosis. However, due
to the limitation of MR devices, significant intensity inhomogeneity often
exists in imaging results, which impedes both qualitative and quantitative
medical analysis. Recently, several unsupervised deep learning-based models
have been proposed for MR image improvement. However, these models merely
concentrate on global appearance learning, and neglect constraints from image
structures and smoothness of bias field, leading to distorted corrected
results. In this paper, novel structure and smoothness constrained dual
networks, named S2DNets, are proposed aiming to self-supervised bias field
correction. S2DNets introduce piece-wise structural constraints and smoothness
of bias field for network training to effectively remove non-uniform intensity
and retain much more structural details. Extensive experiments executed on both
clinical and simulated MR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms
other conventional and deep learning-based models. In addition to comparison on
visual metrics, downstream MR image segmentation tasks are also used to
evaluate the impact of the proposed model. The source code is available at:

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: BronchoGAN提出了一种结合解剖学约束的图像翻译方法，通过条件GAN生成逼真的支气管镜图像，解决了数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支气管镜图像数据有限，限制了深度学习模型的训练，需要一种跨域图像翻译方法以支持临床应用。

Method: 提出BronchoGAN，将解剖学约束（如支气管开口匹配）和基础模型生成的深度图像作为中间表示，集成到条件GAN中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能成功将虚拟支气管镜等不同域图像转换为逼真的人体气道图像，解剖结构保留良好，FID、SSIM和Dice系数显著提升。

Conclusion: BronchoGAN通过解剖约束和中间深度表示，实现了跨域图像翻译，为生成大规模支气管镜图像数据集提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The limited availability of bronchoscopy images makes image synthesis
particularly interesting for training deep learning models. Robust image
translation across different domains -- virtual bronchoscopy, phantom as well
as in-vivo and ex-vivo image data -- is pivotal for clinical applications. This
paper proposes BronchoGAN introducing anatomical constraints for image-to-image
translation being integrated into a conditional GAN. In particular, we force
bronchial orifices to match across input and output images. We further propose
to use foundation model-generated depth images as intermediate representation
ensuring robustness across a variety of input domains establishing models with
substantially less reliance on individual training datasets. Moreover our
intermediate depth image representation allows to easily construct paired image
data for training. Our experiments showed that input images from different
domains (e.g. virtual bronchoscopy, phantoms) can be successfully translated to
images mimicking realistic human airway appearance. We demonstrated that
anatomical settings (i.e. bronchial orifices) can be robustly preserved with
our approach which is shown qualitatively and quantitatively by means of
improved FID, SSIM and dice coefficients scores. Our anatomical constraints
enabled an improvement in the Dice coefficient of up to 0.43 for synthetic
images. Through foundation models for intermediate depth representations,
bronchial orifice segmentation integrated as anatomical constraints into
conditional GANs we are able to robustly translate images from different
bronchoscopy input domains. BronchoGAN allows to incorporate public CT scan
data (virtual bronchoscopy) in order to generate large-scale bronchoscopy image
datasets with realistic appearance. BronchoGAN enables to bridge the gap of
missing public bronchoscopy images.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Estimating brain age from structural MRI has emerged as a powerful tool for
characterizing normative and pathological aging. In this work, we explore
contrastive learning as a scalable and robust alternative to supervised
approaches for brain age estimation. We introduce a novel contrastive loss
function, $\mathcal{L}^{exp}$, and evaluate it across multiple public
neuroimaging datasets comprising over 20,000 scans. Our experiments reveal four
key findings. First, scaling pre-training on diverse, multi-site data
consistently improves generalization performance, cutting external mean
absolute error (MAE) nearly in half. Second, $\mathcal{L}^{exp}$ is robust to
site-related confounds, maintaining low scanner-predictability as training size
increases. Third, contrastive models reliably capture accelerated aging in
patients with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, as shown through
brain age gap analysis, ROC curves, and longitudinal trends. Lastly, unlike
supervised baselines, $\mathcal{L}^{exp}$ maintains a strong correlation
between brain age accuracy and downstream diagnostic performance, supporting
its potential as a foundation model for neuroimaging. These results position
contrastive learning as a promising direction for building generalizable and
clinically meaningful brain representations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ADA-SAM的新型多任务学习框架，用于医学图像分割，结合了分类和分割任务，通过梯度反馈机制提升性能，在有限标注数据下表现优于全监督和半监督基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全监督分割模型依赖大量标注数据，成本高且易出错，需要更高效、自动化的训练方法。

Method: 基于Segment Anything (SAM)框架，利用辅助分类器的类激活图指导半监督分割分支，并通过梯度反馈机制连接分割和分类任务。

Result: 在真实临床数据上验证，ADA-SAM在有限标注数据下性能优于基线方法，提升幅度达两位数。

Conclusion: ADA-SAM是一种高效、自动化的医学图像分割方法，适用于标注数据有限的情况。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a key task in the imaging workflow, influencing
many image-based decisions. Traditional, fully-supervised segmentation models
rely on large amounts of labeled training data, typically obtained through
manual annotation, which can be an expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone
process. This signals a need for accurate, automatic, and annotation-efficient
methods of training these models. We propose ADA-SAM (automated,
domain-specific, and adaptive segment anything model), a novel multitask
learning framework for medical image segmentation that leverages class
activation maps from an auxiliary classifier to guide the predictions of the
semi-supervised segmentation branch, which is based on the Segment Anything
(SAM) framework. Additionally, our ADA-SAM model employs a novel gradient
feedback mechanism to create a learnable connection between the segmentation
and classification branches by using the segmentation gradients to guide and
improve the classification predictions. We validate ADA-SAM on real-world
clinical data collected during rehabilitation trials, and demonstrate that our
proposed method outperforms both fully-supervised and semi-supervised baselines
by double digits in limited label settings. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: TANGERINE是一个开源、计算资源需求低的视觉基础模型，用于低剂量CT（LDCT）分析，可快速适应多种疾病任务，显著减少训练时间和数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LDCT成像在肺癌筛查（LCS）中因放射科医生短缺而难以大规模解读的问题。

Method: 基于自监督学习预训练，使用超过98,000个胸部LDCT扫描数据，采用3D掩码自编码器框架，支持快速微调。

Result: 在14种疾病分类任务中达到最先进性能，包括肺癌和多种呼吸系统疾病，且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: TANGERINE为LDCT分析提供了可扩展的解决方案，有望推动LCS从单一肺癌检测转向全面的呼吸系统疾病管理。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging employed in lung cancer screening
(LCS) programs is increasing in uptake worldwide. LCS programs herald a
generational opportunity to simultaneously detect cancer and non-cancer-related
early-stage lung disease. Yet these efforts are hampered by a shortage of
radiologists to interpret scans at scale. Here, we present TANGERINE, a
computationally frugal, open-source vision foundation model for volumetric LDCT
analysis. Designed for broad accessibility and rapid adaptation, TANGERINE can
be fine-tuned off the shelf for a wide range of disease-specific tasks with
limited computational resources and training data. Relative to models trained
from scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning,
thereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label
efficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of
fine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000
thoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public
datasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease
classification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases,
while generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a
masked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable
solution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive
models by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest
computational requirements. Its accessible, open-source lightweight design lays
the foundation for rapid integration into next-generation medical imaging tools
that could transform LCS initiatives, allowing them to pivot from a singular
focus on lung cancer detection to comprehensive respiratory disease management
in high-risk populations.

Abstract: We propose an open-source framework for Command-style dictation that

Batch processing. Our approach uses Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to segment
audio and transcribes these segments in parallel using Whisper models, enabling
efficient multiplexing across audios. Unlike proprietary systems like
SuperWhisper, this framework is also compatible with most ASR architectures,
including widely used CTC-based models. Our multiplexing technique maximizes
compute utilization in real-world settings, as demonstrated by its deployment
in around 15% of India's courtrooms. Evaluations on live data show consistent
latency reduction as user concurrency increases, compared to sequential batch
processing. The live demonstration will showcase our open-sourced
implementation and allow attendees to interact with it in real-time.

TL;DR: 本文分析了多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）的漏洞，并提出了一种无需训练的防御框架SafePTR，通过选择性修剪有害令牌来提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）在扩展视觉推理能力的同时，引入了新的漏洞，现有防御方法未能有效解决这些问题。

Method: 提出SafePTR框架，选择性修剪早期-中间层的有害令牌，并在后续层恢复良性特征。

Result: 实验表明，SafePTR在三种MLLMs和五个基准测试中显著提升了安全性，且不影响效率。

Conclusion: SafePTR是一种高效且无需训练的防御方法，能有效抵御多模态越狱攻击。

Abstract: By incorporating visual inputs, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
extend LLMs to support visual reasoning. However, this integration also
introduces new vulnerabilities, making MLLMs susceptible to multimodal
jailbreak attacks and hindering their safe deployment.Existing defense methods,
including Image-to-Text Translation, Safe Prompting, and Multimodal Safety
Tuning, attempt to address this by aligning multimodal inputs with LLMs'
built-in safeguards.Yet, they fall short in uncovering root causes of
multimodal vulnerabilities, particularly how harmful multimodal tokens trigger
jailbreak in MLLMs? Consequently, they remain vulnerable to text-driven
multimodal jailbreaks, often exhibiting overdefensive behaviors and imposing
heavy training overhead.To bridge this gap, we present an comprehensive
analysis of where, how and which harmful multimodal tokens bypass safeguards in
MLLMs. Surprisingly, we find that less than 1% tokens in early-middle layers
are responsible for inducing unsafe behaviors, highlighting the potential of
precisely removing a small subset of harmful tokens, without requiring safety
tuning, can still effectively improve safety against jailbreaks. Motivated by
this, we propose Safe Prune-then-Restore (SafePTR), an training-free defense
framework that selectively prunes harmful tokens at vulnerable layers while
restoring benign features at subsequent layers.Without incurring additional
computational overhead, SafePTR significantly enhances the safety of MLLMs
while preserving efficiency. Extensive evaluations across three MLLMs and five
benchmarks demonstrate SafePTR's state-of-the-art performance in mitigating
jailbreak risks without compromising utility.

Result: 成功开发并部署了食品晶体图像分析工具，提高了质量和效率，并通过平台实现了数据隐私保护。

Conclusion: 隐私保护平台有效解决了制造商的数据共享问题，未来可进一步扩展应用。

Abstract: Small- and medium-sized manufacturers need innovative data tools but, because
of competition and privacy concerns, often do not want to share their
proprietary data with researchers who might be interested in helping. This
paper introduces a privacy-preserving platform by which manufacturers may
safely share their data with researchers through secure methods, so that those
researchers then create innovative tools to solve the manufacturers' real-world
problems, and then provide tools that execute solutions back onto the platform
for others to use with privacy and confidentiality guarantees. We illustrate
this problem through a particular use case which addresses an important problem
in the large-scale manufacturing of food crystals, which is that quality
control relies on image analysis tools. Previous to our research, food crystals
in the images were manually counted, which required substantial and
time-consuming human efforts, but we have developed and deployed a crystal
analysis tool which makes this process both more rapid and accurate. The tool
enables automatic characterization of the crystal size distribution and numbers
from microscope images while the natural imperfections from the sample
preparation are automatically removed; a machine learning model to count high
resolution translucent crystals and agglomeration of crystals was also
developed to aid in these efforts. The resulting algorithm was then packaged
for real-world use on the factory floor via a web-based app secured through the
originating privacy-preserving platform, allowing manufacturers to use it while
keeping their proprietary data secure. After demonstrating this full process,
future directions are also explored.

Result: 实验表明T3DM在多数情况下优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: T3DM通过改进分布偏移建模和负采样，显著提升了TKG推理的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is an efficient method for describing the
dynamic development of facts along a timeline. Most research on TKG reasoning
(TKGR) focuses on modelling the repetition of global facts and designing
patterns of local historical facts. However, they face two significant
challenges: inadequate modeling of the event distribution shift between
training and test samples, and reliance on random entity substitution for
generating negative samples, which often results in low-quality sampling. To
this end, we propose a novel distributional feature modeling approach for
training TKGR models, Test-Time Training-guided Distribution shift Modelling
(T3DM), to adjust the model based on distribution shift and ensure the global
consistency of model reasoning. In addition, we design a negative-sampling
strategy to generate higher-quality negative quadruples based on adversarial
training. Extensive experiments show that T3DM provides better and more robust
results than the state-of-the-art baselines in most cases.

Conclusion: VLAD为VLM增强的自动驾驶系统设立了新标杆，同时通过自然语言解释提高了系统的可信度。

Abstract: Recent advancements in open-source Visual Language Models (VLMs) such as
LLaVA, Qwen-VL, and Llama have catalyzed extensive research on their
integration with diverse systems. The internet-scale general knowledge
encapsulated within these models presents significant opportunities for
enhancing autonomous driving perception, prediction, and planning capabilities.
In this paper we propose VLAD, a vision-language autonomous driving model,
which integrates a fine-tuned VLM with VAD, a state-of-the-art end-to-end
system. We implement a specialized fine-tuning approach using custom
question-answer datasets designed specifically to improve the spatial reasoning
capabilities of the model. The enhanced VLM generates high-level navigational
commands that VAD subsequently processes to guide vehicle operation.
Additionally, our system produces interpretable natural language explanations
of driving decisions, thereby increasing transparency and trustworthiness of
the traditionally black-box end-to-end architecture. Comprehensive evaluation
on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our integrated system
reduces average collision rates by 31.82% compared to baseline methodologies,

Abstract: Accurate motion forecasting is critical for safe and efficient autonomous
driving, enabling vehicles to predict future trajectories and make informed
decisions in complex traffic scenarios. Most of the current designs of motion
prediction models are based on the major representation of lane centerlines,
which limits their capability to capture critical road environments and traffic
rules and constraints. In this work, we propose an enhanced motion forecasting
model informed by multiple vector map elements, including lane boundaries and
road edges, that facilitates a richer and more complete representation of
driving environments. An effective feature fusion strategy is developed to
merge information in different vector map components, where the model learns
holistic information on road structures and their interactions with agents.
Since encoding more information about the road environment increases memory
usage and is computationally expensive, we developed an effective pruning
mechanism that filters the most relevant map connections to the target agent,
ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining essential spatial and
semantic relationships for accurate trajectory prediction. Overcoming the
limitations of lane centerline-based models, our method provides a more
informative and efficient representation of the driving environment and
advances the state of the art for autonomous vehicle motion forecasting. We
verify our approach with extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 motion
forecasting dataset, where our method maintains competitiveness on AV2 while
achieving improved performance.

Motivation: 心电图领域的患者队列检索是医学研究和临床实践中的关键任务，但现有方法在处理非结构化EHR数据时存在挑战。

Method: 通过将非结构化的心电图EHR数据转化为查询-段落数据集，并设计基于临床场景的评估指标，应用DPR方法进行队列检索。

Abstract: Patient cohort retrieval is a pivotal task in medical research and clinical
practice, enabling the identification of specific patient groups from extensive
electronic health records (EHRs). In this work, we address the challenge of
cohort retrieval in the echocardiography domain by applying Dense Passage
Retrieval (DPR), a prominent methodology in semantic search. We propose a
systematic approach to transform an echocardiographic EHR dataset of
unstructured nature into a Query-Passage dataset, framing the problem as a
Cohort Retrieval task. Additionally, we design and implement evaluation metrics
inspired by real-world clinical scenarios to rigorously test the models across
diverse retrieval tasks. Furthermore, we present a custom-trained DPR embedding
model that demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional and
off-the-shelf SOTA methods.To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply
DPR for patient cohort retrieval in the echocardiography domain, establishing a
framework that can be adapted to other medical domains.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于嵌入检索（EBR）的方法，用于补充传统分类方法在视频内容审核中的不足，显著提升了性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类方法在快速响应和成本效益方面存在局限，尤其是在趋势适应和紧急升级场景中。

Method: 采用监督对比学习（SCL）框架训练基础嵌入模型，包括单模态和多模态架构，并设计了一个嵌入检索系统。

Result: 离线实验显示EBR将ROC-AUC从0.85提升至0.99，PR-AUC从0.35提升至0.95；在线实验表明EBR提高了10.32%的行动率并降低了80%以上的运营成本。

Conclusion: EBR方法在视频内容审核中表现出更高的效率、灵活性和可解释性，优于传统分类方法。

Abstract: Video understanding plays a fundamental role for content moderation on short
video platforms, enabling the detection of inappropriate content. While
classification remains the dominant approach for content moderation, it often
struggles in scenarios requiring rapid and cost-efficient responses, such as
trend adaptation and urgent escalations. To address this issue, we introduce an
Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) method designed to complement traditional
classification approaches. We first leverage a Supervised Contrastive Learning
(SCL) framework to train a suite of foundation embedding models, including both
single-modal and multi-modal architectures. Our models demonstrate superior
performance over established contrastive learning methods such as CLIP and
MoCo. Building on these embedding models, we design and implement the
embedding-based retrieval system that integrates embedding generation and video
retrieval to enable efficient and effective trend handling. Comprehensive
offline experiments on 25 diverse emerging trends show that EBR improves
ROC-AUC from 0.85 to 0.99 and PR-AUC from 0.35 to 0.95. Further online
experiments reveal that EBR increases action rates by 10.32% and reduces
operational costs by over 80%, while also enhancing interpretability and
flexibility compared to classification-based solutions.

Motivation: 现有协作驾驶通信方式（如传感器数据、神经网络特征等）在带宽效率、信息完整性和智能体互操作性上存在局限，且缺乏决策级融合。

Method: 采用自然语言作为通信媒介，直接传递意图、推理和决策，实现从感知数据共享到主动协调的转变。

Result: 自然语言通信平衡了语义密度与带宽，适应实时条件，并支持异构智能体平台协作。

Conclusion: 自然语言通信提升了智能交通系统的安全性、效率和透明度，推动了协作驾驶的发展。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative driving promises improvements in traffic safety and
efficiency through collective perception and decision making. However, existing
communication media -- including raw sensor data, neural network features, and
perception results -- suffer limitations in bandwidth efficiency, information
completeness, and agent interoperability. Moreover, traditional approaches have
largely ignored decision-level fusion, neglecting critical dimensions of
collaborative driving. In this paper we argue that addressing these challenges
requires a transition from purely perception-oriented data exchanges to
explicit intent and reasoning communication using natural language. Natural
language balances semantic density and communication bandwidth, adapts flexibly
to real-time conditions, and bridges heterogeneous agent platforms. By enabling
the direct communication of intentions, rationales, and decisions, it
transforms collaborative driving from reactive perception-data sharing into
proactive coordination, advancing safety, efficiency, and transparency in
intelligent transportation systems.

Method: 开发量子编译器araQne，通过电路重排序策略优化分布式量子电路的分配成本，减少所需的纠缠对数。

Result: 电路重排序策略显著降低了分配成本，相比基线方法更高效。

Conclusion: araQne编译器在减少量子网络通信需求方面具有重要作用，为分布式量子计算提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Just as classical computing relies on distributed systems, the quantum
computing era requires new kinds of infrastructure and software tools. Quantum
networks will become the backbone of hybrid, quantum-augmented data centers, in
which quantum algorithms are distributed over a local network of quantum
processing units (QPUs) interconnected via shared entanglement. In this
context, it is crucial to develop methods and software that minimize the number
of inter-QPU communications. Here we describe key features of the quantum
compiler araQne, which is designed to minimize distribution cost, measured by
the number of entangled pairs required to distribute a monolithic quantum
circuit using gate teleportation protocols. We establish the crucial role
played by circuit reordering strategies, which strongly reduce the distribution
cost compared to a baseline approach.

Method: 分析五种常见电子结构方法（如Tequila和ffsim中的方法），利用Qiskit Circuit Cutting插件评估其通过局部操作（LO）分布化的可行性。

Result: 多数电子结构方法无法通过LO高效并行化，需开发新方法以适应DQC框架。

Conclusion: 当前电子结构方法在DQC中应用受限，需进一步研究开发适合分布化的新方法。

Abstract: To move towards the utility era of quantum computing, many corporations have
posed distributed quantum computing (DQC) as a framework for scaling the
current generation of devices for practical applications. One of these
applications is quantum chemistry, also known as electronic structure theory,
which has been poised as a "killer application" of quantum computing, To this

such as Tequila and ffsim, which can be easily interfaced with the Qiskit
Circuit Cutting addon. Herein, we provide insights into cutting these
algorithms using local operations (LO) to determine their aptitude for
distribution. The key findings of our work are that many of these algorithms
cannot be efficiently parallelized using LO, and new methods must be developed

Abstract: Deep neural networks generate and process large volumes of data, posing
challenges for low-resource embedded systems. In-memory computing has been
demonstrated as an efficient computing infrastructure and shows promise for
embedded AI applications. Among newly-researched memory technologies, racetrack
memory is a non-volatile technology that allows high data density fabrication,
making it a good fit for in-memory computing. However, integrating in-memory
arithmetic circuits with memory cells affects both the memory density and power
efficiency. It remains challenging to build efficient in-memory arithmetic
circuits on racetrack memory within area and energy constraints. To this end,
we present an efficient in-memory convolutional neural network (CNN)
accelerator optimized for use with racetrack memory. We design a series of
fundamental arithmetic circuits as in-memory computing cells suited for
multiply-and-accumulate operations. Moreover, we explore the design space of
racetrack memory based systems and CNN model architectures, employing co-design
to improve the efficiency and performance of performing CNN inference in
racetrack memory while maintaining model accuracy. Our designed circuits and

Motivation: 传统Data+AI系统依赖人工专家协调，缺乏语义理解和规划能力，LLMs的成功为改进提供了机会。

Method: 提出‘数据代理’架构，整合知识理解、推理和规划能力，解决数据任务协调问题。

Result: 展示了多种数据代理系统实例，并探讨了设计中的挑战。

Conclusion: 数据代理有望革新Data+AI系统，但仍面临开放挑战。

Abstract: Traditional Data+AI systems utilize data-driven techniques to optimize
performance, but they rely heavily on human experts to orchestrate system
pipelines, enabling them to adapt to changes in data, queries, tasks, and
environments. For instance, while there are numerous data science tools
available, developing a pipeline planning system to coordinate these tools
remains challenging. This difficulty arises because existing Data+AI systems
have limited capabilities in semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning.
Fortunately, we have witnessed the success of large language models (LLMs) in
enhancing semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning abilities. It is
crucial to incorporate LLM techniques to revolutionize data systems for
orchestrating Data+AI applications effectively.
  To achieve this, we propose the concept of a 'Data Agent' - a comprehensive
architecture designed to orchestrate Data+AI ecosystems, which focuses on
tackling data-related tasks by integrating knowledge comprehension, reasoning,
and planning capabilities. We delve into the challenges involved in designing
data agents, such as understanding data/queries/environments/tools,
orchestrating pipelines/workflows, optimizing and executing pipelines, and
fostering pipeline self-reflection. Furthermore, we present examples of data
agent systems, including a data science agent, data analytics agents (such as
unstructured data analytics agent, semantic structured data analytics agent,
data lake analytics agent, and multi-modal data analytics agent), and a
database administrator (DBA) agent. We also outline several open challenges
associated with designing data agent systems.

Result: 发现海马体与前楔叶、楔叶、后扣带回皮层等区域的功能连接对年龄高度敏感，前后海马体功能连接存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了海马体衰老的功能机制，展示了可解释深度学习在神经影像数据分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Grey matter loss in the hippocampus is a hallmark of neurobiological aging,
yet understanding the corresponding changes in its functional connectivity
remains limited. Seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis enables
voxel-wise mapping of the hippocampus's synchronous activity with cortical
regions, offering a window into functional reorganization during aging. In this
study, we develop an interpretable deep learning framework to predict brain age
from hippocampal FC using a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D
CNN) combined with LayerCAM saliency mapping. This approach maps key
hippocampal-cortical connections, particularly with the precuneus, cuneus,
posterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal cortex, left superior parietal
lobule, and right superior temporal sulcus, that are highly sensitive to age.
Critically, disaggregating anterior and posterior hippocampal FC reveals
distinct mapping aligned with their known functional specializations. These
findings provide new insights into the functional mechanisms of hippocampal
aging and demonstrate the power of explainable deep learning to uncover
biologically meaningful patterns in neuroimaging data.

forms using Xiaozhuan glyphs, suggested by the Large Language Model (LLM),
together with physical materials. Supported by human facilitation and a soft AI
presence, participants transformed lived experience into visual and tactile
expressions without requiring digital literacy. This approach offers new
perspectives on human-AI collaboration and aging by repositioning AI not as a
content producer but as a supportive mechanism, and by supporting narrative

Method: 优化基础模型，并与经典随机模型（如移动平均和自回归模型）进行比较，分析其在突发事件预测中的表现。

Result: 基础模型在预测突发事件时表现优于传统模型，并成功估计了特定根因的年中断统计数据，误差低于6%。

Conclusion: 基础模型在预测罕见且突发的事件中具有潜力，为实际应用提供了更准确的预测工具。

Abstract: Time series forecasting models have diverse real world applications (e.g.,
from electricity metrics to software workload). Latest foundational models
trained for time series forecasting show strengths (e.g., for long sequences
and in zero-shot settings). However, foundational model was not yet used for
forecasting rare, spiky events, i.e., a challenging target because those are a
corner case of extreme events. In this paper, we optimize a state-of-the-art
foundational model to forecast sporadic or spiky production outages of
high-performance machine learning services powering billions of client devices.
We evaluate the forecasting errors of the foundational model compared with
classical stochastic forecasting models (e.g., moving average and
autoregressive). The analysis helps us understand how each of the evaluated
models performs for the sporadic or spiky events. For example, it identifies
the key patterns in the target data that are well tracked by the foundational
model vs. each of the stochastic models. We use the models with optimal
parameters to estimate a year-long outage statistics of a particular root cause
with less than 6% value errors.

Abstract: As the demand for large scale AI models continues to grow, the optimization
of their training to balance computational efficiency, execution time, accuracy
and energy consumption represents a critical multidimensional challenge.
Achieving this balance requires not only innovative algorithmic techniques and
hardware architectures but also comprehensive tools for monitoring, analyzing,
and understanding the underlying processes involved in model training and
deployment. Provenance data information about the origins, context, and
transformations of data and processes has become a key component in this
pursuit. By leveraging provenance, researchers and engineers can gain insights
into resource usage patterns, identify inefficiencies, and ensure
reproducibility and accountability in AI development workflows. For this
reason, the question of how distributed resources can be optimally utilized to
scale large AI models in an energy efficient manner is a fundamental one. To
support this effort, we introduce the yProv4ML library, a tool designed to
collect provenance data in JSON format, compliant with the W3C PROV and ProvML
standards. yProv4ML focuses on flexibility and extensibility, and enables users
to integrate additional data collection tools via plugins. The library is fully
integrated with the yProv framework, allowing for higher level pairing in tasks
run also through workflow management systems.

Abstract: The rapid growth of interest in large language models (LLMs) reflects their
potential for flexibility and generalization, and attracted the attention of a
diverse range of researchers. However, the advent of these techniques has also
brought to light the lack of transparency and rigor with which development is
pursued. In particular, the inability to determine the number of epochs and
other hyperparameters in advance presents challenges in identifying the best
model. To address this challenge, machine learning frameworks such as MLFlow
can automate the collection of this type of information. However, these tools
capture data using proprietary formats and pose little attention to lineage.
This paper proposes yProv4ML, a framework to capture provenance information

Conclusion: Dist-FedAvg有效解决了现有聚合方法的局限性，提升了推荐效果且易于集成到现有联邦学习框架中。

Abstract: Graph federated recommendation systems offer a privacy-preserving alternative
to traditional centralized recommendation architectures, which often raise
concerns about data security. While federated learning enables personalized
recommendations without exposing raw user data, existing aggregation methods
overlook the unique properties of user embeddings in this setting. Indeed,
traditional aggregation methods fail to account for their complexity and the
critical role of user similarity in recommendation effectiveness. Moreover,
evolving user interactions require adaptive aggregation while preserving the
influence of high-relevance anchor users (the primary users before expansion in
graph-based frameworks). To address these limitations, we introduce
Dist-FedAvg, a novel distance-based aggregation method designed to enhance
personalization and aggregation efficiency in graph federated learning. Our
method assigns higher aggregation weights to users with similar embeddings,
while ensuring that anchor users retain significant influence in local updates.
Empirical evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that Dist-FedAvg
consistently outperforms baseline aggregation techniques, improving
recommendation accuracy while maintaining seamless integration into existing
federated learning frameworks.

Abstract: With the development of generative artificial intelligence and instruction
tuning techniques, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made
impressive progress on general reasoning tasks. Benefiting from the
chain-of-thought (CoT) methodology, MLLMs can solve the visual reasoning
problem step-by-step. However, existing MLLMs still face significant challenges
when applied to pathology visual reasoning tasks: (1) LLMs often underperforms
because they lack domain-specific information, which can lead to model
hallucinations. (2) The additional reasoning steps in CoT may introduce errors,
leading to the divergence of answers. To address these limitations, we propose
PathCoT, a novel zero-shot CoT prompting method which integrates the pathology
expert-knowledge into the reasoning process of MLLMs and incorporates
self-evaluation to mitigate divergence of answers. Specifically, PathCoT guides
the MLLM with prior knowledge to perform as pathology experts, and provides
comprehensive analysis of the image with their domain-specific knowledge. By
incorporating the experts' knowledge, PathCoT can obtain the answers with CoT
reasoning. Furthermore, PathCoT incorporates a self-evaluation step that
assesses both the results generated directly by MLLMs and those derived through
CoT, finally determining the reliable answer. The experimental results on the
PathMMU dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on pathology visual
understanding and reasoning.

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of toxic content on social media poses a serious
threat to both online environments and public discourse, highlighting the
urgent need for detoxification methods that effectively remove toxicity while
preserving the original semantics. However, existing approaches often struggle
to simultaneously achieve strong detoxification performance, semantic
preservation, and robustness to out-of-distribution data. Moreover, they
typically rely on costly, manually annotated parallel corpora while showing
poor data efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage
training framework that jointly optimizes for data efficiency, semantic
preservation, and model generalization. We first perform supervised fine-tuning
on a small set of high-quality, filtered parallel data to establish a strong
initialization. Then, we leverage unlabeled toxic inputs and a custom-designed
reward model to train the LLM using Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the
trade-offs faced by previous work, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
improved generalization and significantly reduced dependence on annotated data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决过程强化学习中引入额外过程奖励模型带来的计算开销大和缺乏统一理论框架的问题。

Method: 提出SPRO框架，包括从策略模型内在推导过程奖励，以及定义累积过程奖励和掩码步骤优势（MSA）。

Result: SPRO在训练效率上比GRPO高3.4倍，测试准确率提升17.5%，同时减少响应长度约1/3。

Conclusion: SPRO无需额外计算开销，适用于工业实现，同时保持策略熵稳定，防止奖励黑客攻击。

Abstract: Process Reinforcement Learning~(PRL) has demonstrated considerable potential
in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, introducing additional process reward models incurs substantial
computational overhead, and there is no unified theoretical framework for
process-level advantage estimation. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{S}elf-Guided \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{R}eward
\textbf{O}ptimization~(\textbf{SPRO}), a novel framework that enables
process-aware RL through two key innovations: (1) we first theoretically
demonstrate that process rewards can be derived intrinsically from the policy
model itself, and (2) we introduce well-defined cumulative process rewards and
\textbf{M}asked \textbf{S}tep \textbf{A}dvantage (\textbf{MSA}), which
facilitates rigorous step-wise action advantage estimation within shared-prompt
sampling groups. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPRO outperforms
vaniila GRPO with 3.4x higher training efficiency and a 17.5\% test accuracy
improvement. Furthermore, SPRO maintains a stable and elevated policy entropy
throughout training while reducing the average response length by approximately
$1/3$, evidencing sufficient exploration and prevention of reward hacking.
Notably, SPRO incurs no additional computational overhead compared to
outcome-supervised RL methods such as GRPO, which benefit industrial
implementation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Prefix-RFT的混合方法，结合了监督微调（SFT）和强化微调（RFT）的优势，提升了模型性能并解决了各自的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFT和RFT方法各有优缺点，SFT容易过度拟合演示数据，而RFT对初始策略敏感且可能学习到意外行为，因此需要一种统一的方法。

Method: 提出Prefix-RFT，结合演示和探索学习，通过数学推理问题验证其有效性。

Result: Prefix-RFT性能优于单独的SFT和RFT，且对演示数据的质量和数量变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Prefix-RFT为LLM后训练提供了一种统一范式，结合演示和探索是未来研究的有前景方向。

Abstract: Existing post-training techniques for large language models are broadly
categorized into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(RFT). Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking
demonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of
behavior cloning. Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's
performance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is
highly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified
view of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that
synergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical
reasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is
both simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone
SFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key
advantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks,
requiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis
highlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that
Prefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore,
ablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality
and quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective
on LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously
integrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for
future research.

TL;DR: BBoxER是一种基于进化算法的黑盒优化方法，用于大型语言模型（LLM）的后训练，通过隐式压缩训练数据引入信息瓶颈，提供理论保证和实际性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度优化依赖大量标注数据，存在隐私和安全问题；黑盒优化方法在数据受限或对抗风险高时更适用，但面临可扩展性和计算成本挑战。

Conclusion: BBoxER是梯度优化的有效补充，适用于隐私敏感或受限环境。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering
efficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, its reliance on
large volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as
susceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In
contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque
function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a
promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial
risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also
pose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional
parameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high
computational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper
introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that
induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training
data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong
theoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to
data poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates
on top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement
suitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in
addition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we
demonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing
how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a
benchmark of reasoning datasets. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on
on top of gradient-based optimization.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) have transformed the fine-tuning of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by enabling parameter-efficient updates. However, their
widespread adoption remains limited by the reliance on GPU-based training. In
this work, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to LoRA fine-tuning
designed specifically for users with limited computational resources,
particularly those restricted to standard laptop CPUs. Our method learns a
meta-operator that maps any input dataset, represented as a probability
distribution, to a set of LoRA weights by leveraging a large bank of
pre-trained adapters for the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model. Instead of
performing new gradient-based updates, our pipeline constructs adapters via
lightweight combinations of existing LoRAs directly on CPU. While the resulting
adapters do not match the performance of GPU-trained counterparts, they
consistently outperform the base Mistral model on downstream tasks, offering a
practical and accessible alternative to traditional GPU-based fine-tuning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过统一策略模型和过程奖励模型（PRM），减少参数并提高推理效率，同时支持灵活的推理模式。

Method: 使用共享主干网络和任务特定头，结合自监督过程奖励模型（SPRM），无需额外过程标注。

Result: MetaStone-S1在32B参数规模下性能与OpenAI-o3-mini相当，并建立了计算量与TTS性能的缩放规律。

Conclusion: MetaStone-S1是一个高效且灵活的生成模型，适用于不同推理需求，已开源供研究社区使用。

Abstract: We introduce our first reflective generative model MetaStone-S1, which
obtains OpenAI o3's performance via the self-supervised process reward model
(SPRM). Through sharing the backbone network and using task-specific heads for
next token prediction and process scoring respectively, SPRM successfully
integrates the policy model and process reward model(PRM) into a unified
interface without extra process annotation, reducing over 99% PRM parameters
for efficient reasoning. Equipped with SPRM, MetaStone-S1 is naturally suitable
for test time scaling (TTS), and we provide three reasoning effort modes (low,
medium, and high), based on the controllable thinking length. Moreover, we
empirically establish a scaling law that reveals the relationship between total
thinking computation and TTS performance. Experiments demonstrate that our
MetaStone-S1 achieves comparable performance to OpenAI-o3-mini's series with
only 32B parameter size. To support the research community, we have
open-sourced MetaStone-S1 at https://github.com/MetaStone-AI/MetaStone-S1.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索独立训练的视觉和语言模型是否可以通过优化实现共享的统计模型，超越后验统计检测的对齐。

Method: 引入JAM框架，联合训练模态特定的自编码器，通过重建和跨模态目标鼓励对齐。

Conclusion: 轻量级的Pareto高效框架能够可靠地诱导对齐，为将通用单模态基础模型转化为专业多模态模型提供了理论和实践路径。

Abstract: Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint
representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and
architectures. Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation
Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared
statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a
fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of
alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations?
We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task
- preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual
coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that
jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of
pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both
reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as
a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure
from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design
axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its
hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at
which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model
scale on representational convergence. Our findings show that our lightweight
Pareto-efficient framework reliably induces alignment, even across frozen,
independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight and
practical pathways for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into
specialist multimodal models.

Motivation: 尽管zapping在持续学习中表现出有效性，但其背后的机制尚不明确。

Result: zapping能更快适应新领域；优化器选择也会影响学习与遗忘的动态。

Conclusion: zapping和优化器选择共同影响任务间的协同/干扰模式。

Abstract: Recent work in continual learning has highlighted the beneficial effect of
resampling weights in the last layer of a neural network (``zapping"). Although
empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, the
underlying mechanisms that drive these improvements remain unclear. In this
work, we investigate in detail the pattern of learning and forgetting that take
place inside a convolutional neural network when trained in challenging
settings such as continual learning and few-shot transfer learning, with
handwritten characters and natural images. Our experiments show that models
that have undergone zapping during training more quickly recover from the shock
of transferring to a new domain. Furthermore, to better observe the effect of
continual learning in a multi-task setting we measure how each individual task
is affected. This shows that, not only zapping, but the choice of optimizer can
also deeply affect the dynamics of learning and forgetting, causing complex
patterns of synergy/interference between tasks to emerge when the model learns
sequentially at transfer time.
