Prior PIM\narchitectures have shown potential to improve energy efficiency and\nperformance. However, such advantages rely on data proximity to the processing\nunits performing computations. Data movement overheads can degrade PIM's\nperformance and energy efficiency due to the need to move data between a\nprocessing unit and a distant memory location. %they face challenges due to the\noverhead of transferring data from remote memory locations to processing units\ninside memory for computation. In this paper, we demonstrate that a large\nfraction of PIM's latency per memory request is attributed to data transfers\nand queuing delays from remote memory accesses. To improve PIM's data locality,\nwe propose DL-PIM, a novel architecture that dynamically detects the overhead\nof data movement, and proactively moves data to a reserved area in the local\nmemory of the requesting processing unit. DL-PIM uses a distributed\naddress-indirection hardware lookup table to redirect traffic to the current\ndata location. We propose DL-PIM implementations on two 3D stacked memories:\nHMC and HBM. While some workloads benefit from DL-PIM, others are negatively\nimpacted by the additional latency due to indirection accesses. Therefore, we\npropose an adaptive mechanism that assesses the cost and benefit of indirection\nand dynamically enables or disables it to prevent degrading workloads that\nsuffer from indirection. Overall, DL-PIM reduces the average memory latency per\nrequest by 54% in HMC and 50% in HBM which resulted in performance improvement\nof 15% for workloads with substantial data reuse in HMC and 5% in HBM. For all\nrepresentative workloads, DL-PIM achieved a 6% speedup in HMC and a 3% speedup\nin HBM, showing that DL-PIM enhances data locality and overall system\nperformance."}

However,\nexisting hardware poorly matches the different requirements of each phase.\nCurrent datacenter GPUs and TPUs follow a more-is-better design philosophy that\nmaximizes compute and memory resources, causing memory bandwidth\nunderutilization in the prefill phase and compute underutilization in the\ndecode phase.

However,\nexisting hardware poorly matches the different requirements of each phase.\nCurrent datacenter GPUs and TPUs follow a more-is-better design philosophy that\nmaximizes compute and memory resources, causing memory bandwidth\nunderutilization in the prefill phase and compute underutilization in the\ndecode phase. Such underutilization directly translates into increased serving\ncosts.\n  This paper proposes SPAD (Specialized Prefill and Decode hardware), adopting\na less-is-more methodology to design specialized chips tailored to the distinct\ncharacteristics of prefill and decode phases.

In contrast, pruning is typically\ncarried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output\nmismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such\nerrors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively\nmodifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned\nparameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the\ngeometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and\nsimultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.\nFurthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that\nstrongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error\nrecovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect\nthese principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that\nensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model.

Most existing analyses are limited to\nsuperficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner\nworkings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'\nthought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking\nissue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on\nsimple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose\nthe thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring\ndiscourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought\nprogression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for\ntopically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for\nopen-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides\nevidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of\noverthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a\nutility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based\nmetrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of\nLLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled\noverthinking management."}

While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR\nhave set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can\nbe a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical\ntrade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art\nSwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\non this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but\nimportant finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher\npeak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the\nlightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,\nthe CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of\ntraining, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This\nefficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times\nsmaller than SwinIR.

During pre-training, predicting the next tokens\n(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of\nlearned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory\nconsolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in\nlinguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and\nconjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental\nevidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show\nthat a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features.

This imbalance creates a\nsignificant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations\ninstead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant\npredictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we\npropose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.\nInstead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the\nlearning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial\nreference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model\nto move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying\ncausal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations\nfrom a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance\ncaused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise\nNormalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization\nobjective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain\nwaypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate\nthe effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a\nstate-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two\ndenoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the\nlearning task and improves model performance.

Recent advances in\nmultimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization\nand visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series\nremains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and\ndiscrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel\nframework that leverages multimodal large language models for general\ntime-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series\nchannel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one\ncomposite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a\ntemporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with\ntheir corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details\nfrom the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the\nvisual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal\ntime-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,\nclassification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).\nThese results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with\npretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series\nanalysis."}

To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent\nframework that automates the discovery of interpretable features.

As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on\nexpert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This\nlimitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a\nnarrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment\ndiversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call\nearly experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where\nthe resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within\nthis paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world\nmodeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment\ndynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal\nactions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight\ndiverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently\nimprove effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value\nof early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our\nresults provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong\nfoundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical\nbridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents."}

We address this challenge with\na vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes\nmultimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM\ncontroller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs\nM-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified\ntrajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we\ndevelop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool\nreasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of\n11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via\nstep-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,\nMATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating\nscalable and effective multimodal tool use.
