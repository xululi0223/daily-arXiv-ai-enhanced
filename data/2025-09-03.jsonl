This paper explores a new direction for\ndynamic adaptation by investigating a novel class of post-hoc, diagnostic\nsignals. We propose Dynamic Speculative Decoding Engine (DSDE), a training-free\nframework built on two primary components: (1) a predictive signal based on the\nvariance of the Kullback-Leibler (KLD) divergence, which diagnoses the\ngeneration's regional stability, and (2) an adaptive speculation length cap to\nmitigate the straggler problem in per-sequence decoding. Experiments\ndemonstrate the potential of using KLD-based stability signals for dynamic\nadaptation. An algorithm guided by these signals achieves end-to-end latency\ncompetitive with leading baselines and exhibits superior robustness across\ndiverse workloads. This robustness is particularly valuable in challenging\nlow-acceptance-rate regimes, where the proposed signal maintains its diagnostic\nutility.

Although contemporary dehazing models have\ndemonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated\nhigh-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to\ndownsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads\nto a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the\ndifficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with\nlocalized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this\nchapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local\nFeatures Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for\nhigh-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:\nthe Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The\nGFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual\nunderstanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary\noutput by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby\ncapturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer\narchitecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on\nhigh-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in\naddressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is\nmodel-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed\nglobal-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners\ncan harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving\nvisual fidelity in high-resolution environments."}

Our investigation\nreveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length\nCollapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF\ntraining, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score\ndrops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally\ncompromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities.

However, the general case with arbitrary\nconcave speedup functions -- which more accurately capture real-world workloads\n-- has remained open.\n  In this paper, we solve this open problem by developing optimal scheduling\nalgorithms for parallel jobs under general concave speedup functions. We first\ndiscover a fundamental and broadly-applicable rule for optimal parallel\nscheduling, namely the Consistent Derivative Ratio (CDR) Rule, which states\nthat the ratio of the derivatives of the speedup functions across active jobs\nremains constant over time. To efficiently compute the optimal allocations that\nsatisfy the CDR Rule, we propose the General Water-Filling (GWF) method, a more\ngeneral version of classical water-filling in wireless communications.\nCombining these insights, we design the SmartFill Algorithm to solve the\ngeneral scheduling problem. Unlike heSRPT, which always allocates resources to\nall active jobs, SmartFill selectively determines which jobs should receive\nresources and how much they should be allocated. For a broad class of so-called\n\\emph{regular} speedup functions, SmartFill yields closed-form optimal\nsolutions, while for non-regular functions it efficiently computes the optimum\nwith low complexity.

Two key aspects of\nthe algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and\naccuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous\nlines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms\nwith optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for\npower-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$\nextend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that\nworsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded\nerror but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$\nalgorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our\ndevelopment of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes\nbeyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the\n$FHT2DT$ algorithm.

Federated Lifelong Learning (FLL) provides an ideal solution by\nincorporating federated and lifelong learning to overcome catastrophic\nforgetting. The extended lifecycle of FLL in IoT systems increases their\nvulnerability to persistent attacks, and these risks may be obscured by\nperformance degradation caused by spatial-temporal data heterogeneity.\nMoreover, this problem is exacerbated by the standard single-server\narchitecture, as its single point of failure makes it difficult to maintain a\nreliable audit trail for long-term threats. Blockchain provides a tamper-proof\nfoundation for trustworthy FLL systems. Nevertheless, directly applying\nblockchain to FLL significantly increases computational and retrieval costs\nwith the expansion of the knowledge base, slowing down the training on IoT\ndevices. To address these challenges, we propose LiFeChain, a lightweight\nblockchain for secure and efficient federated lifelong learning by providing a\ntamper-resistant ledger with minimal on-chain disclosure and bidirectional\nverification. To the best of our knowledge, LiFeChain is the first blockchain\ntailored for FLL. LiFeChain incorporates two complementary mechanisms: the\nproof-of-model-correlation (PoMC) consensus on the server, which couples\nlearning and unlearning mechanisms to mitigate negative transfer, and segmented\nzero-knowledge arbitration (Seg-ZA) on the client, which detects and arbitrates\nabnormal committee behavior without compromising privacy. LiFeChain is designed\nas a plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing\nFLL algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that LiFeChain not only\nenhances model performance against two long-term attacks but also sustains high\nefficiency and scalability."}

While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual\nmodels to 3D domains through \"high-to-low\" mapping, these approaches often lead\nto the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for\nadapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly\nleverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any\nmodality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive\nPoint-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a\nmodest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without\nheterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by\naggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear\nlayers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the\ninherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of\nimages and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the\nrelative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched\nwith location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate\nself-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce\ncomputational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights\nwith the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without\nadding additional parameters.

Traditional data-driven approaches, such as\nconvolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological\ninformation about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate\ninformation exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning\nhydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction\nmodels collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training\nexplodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing\nmethods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying\nGNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences,\nthus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for\naccurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every\nland and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow\ndirections and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a\nspatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the\nmost influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and\nacross five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97),\nimproved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\\pm$5%) in hourly\ndischarge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal\nsparse, structured intercatchment influences.

Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)\nmodule, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global\nmodifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are\npartitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask\nproposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local\nscale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image\npatches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich\nthe text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual\nfeatures, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary\nsemantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a\nCross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual\ninformation from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module\nintegrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation\noutput, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across\nglobal and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES)."}

We first synthesize QA pairs from single and\nmulti-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the\nplaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a\nparameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally,\nguided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard\nRAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without\noriginal documents. Experiments on four QA datasets show that DistilledPRAG\noutperforms baselines in accuracy and generalizes well on OOD data."}

While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary\nobjective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In\nRAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,\nwith only a small subset directly relevant to the query.

On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the\nbrain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image\ngeneration capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain\nencoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with\nsufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this\nproblem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as\nexisting approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses\nto validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our\nframework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP\nvisual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,\nand a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct\nbiologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike\nconventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for\nconditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between\nvisual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained\nalignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two\nmultimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its\neffectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we\nvisualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both\ndatasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and\ninter-subject variations in M/EEG signals."}

In this paper, we explore model growth, a\npromising strategy that leverages smaller models to expedite and structure the\ntraining of larger ones for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem.\nAlthough growth-based pretraining, particularly via transformer stacking, has\nshown promise in accelerating convergence, its impact on forgetting remains\nunder-explored.

SegDINO extracts multi-level features from\nthe pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,\nand utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.\nThis design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the\nrepresentational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six\nbenchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three\nnatural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO\nconsistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing\nmethods.

Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese\npoetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or\nAI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly\ndisrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying\nAI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel\nbenchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first\nconstruct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six\nprofessional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.\nSubsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on\nthis dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be\nused as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The\nmost difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially\nstyle. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our\nproposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of\nAI-generated poetry."}

Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract\nnews semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,\nstylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues\ncan easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in\ndynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news\nlandscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective\nby incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and\nsemantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one\ncan deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than\nthe surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose\nGraph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,\nwhich models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via\ngraph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and\nintent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context\ninteraction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and\nimplementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve\nbetter alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic\npathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and\naggregation across these signals by establishing a common space.

To answer this\nquestion, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)\nacross 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12\ndiverse prompt templates.

In this paper, we explore the use of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) as assistants for the human judge to resolve such\ndisputes, as part of our DRAssist system. We focus on disputes from two\nspecific domains -- automobile insurance and domain name disputes. DRAssist\nidentifies certain key structural elements (e.g., facts, aspects or\ndisagreement, arguments) of the disputes and summarizes the unstructured\ndispute descriptions to produce a structured summary for each dispute. We then\nexplore multiple prompting strategies with multiple LLMs for their ability to\nassist in resolving the disputes in these domains. In DRAssist, these LLMs are\nprompted to produce the resolution output at three different levels -- (i)\nidentifying an overall stronger party in a dispute, (ii) decide whether each\nspecific demand of each contesting party can be accepted or not, (iii) evaluate\nwhether each argument by each contesting party is strong or weak. We evaluate\nthe performance of LLMs on all these tasks by comparing them with relevant\nbaselines using suitable evaluation metrics."}

In\nthe Indian context, our empirical evaluations across a suite of models reveal\nthat biases around caste and religion are particularly salient.

Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, to guide LLM\noutputs toward fairness, neutrality, and inclusion in line with Articles 14 to\n17. Our approach introduces a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer, guided by the\nAI Constitution of India and applied only at inference time, without any\nparameter updates to the base model. We incorporate a speculative decoding\nalgorithm that proactively reduces casteist and communal bias during\ngeneration. This mitigation layer operates directly within the decoding\nprocess, avoiding changes to model internals and lowering the computational and\ninfrastructural costs associated with retraining. We reinterpret speculative\ndecoding not merely as an efficiency tool but as a mechanism for fairness. In\nthis framework, a Small Language Model (SLM) acts as a potentially biased\ngenerator, while a constitutionally guided Large Language Model (LLM) serves as\nthe verifier. Rather than accelerating generation, the LLM enforces bias-robust\ntrajectories in the SLM outputs. This inversion of roles gives rise to a\nfairness-by-speculation paradigm.

We also assess the performance of Google\nGemini in a zero-shot setting using a modified version of the dataset with NER\ntags removed. All models are tested on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using\nPrecision, Recall, and F1-score. Results show that code-mixed models,\nparticularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based fine-tuned models, outperform\nothers - including closed-source LLMs like Google Gemini - due to\ndomain-specific pretraining. Non-code-mixed models perform reasonably but show\nlimited adaptability. Notably, Google Gemini exhibits competitive zero-shot\nperformance, underlining the generalization strength of modern LLMs. This study\nprovides key insights into the effectiveness of specialized versus generalized\nmodels for code-mixed NER tasks."}

In fact, the key challenge in generating\nvariable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across\nresolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for\ngenerating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of\nthree critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled\ngeneration: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.\nSpecifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution\ngeneration loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled\nimage generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)\nThe spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with\nvariable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose\n\\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image\ngeneration by effectively utilizing information from three aspects\ncorrespondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency\nCompensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by\ndilated convolution in higher-resolution generation.

For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x\n(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,\nequivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This\nsuperior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest\nvision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We\nhold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is\ncompelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation\nmodels."}

In this paper, we explore its\nuntapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent\npixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the\nfirst image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes\nincomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and\nreconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The\ncontinuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence\nin the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a\npatch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates\ninference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a\npretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally\nrobust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide\nsemantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content\nremains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene.

Object-centric learning aims\nto mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot\nattention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and\nhas been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot\nattention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic\ninformation. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on\nlow-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly\nsensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object\ncontours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to\nfine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space\nthroughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the\nflexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,\nboth of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.\nIn the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground\nand background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional\ncontextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level\nfeatures. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the\noriginal reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a\nfeature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation.

Yet,\na key challenge remains: aligning textual monologues with audio streams that\noperate at different bitrates. The prevailing solution relies on word-level\nalignment, but this can degrade the language ability of large pre-trained\nmodels. Moreover, it requires highly accurate timestamps for every token, which\nintroduces cascading errors and increases pre-processing costs. In this paper,\nwe propose textual monologues in continuous tokens sequence, namely \"natural\"\nmonologues, which mimics humanoid cognitive behavior in dialogs. For temporal\nalignment, we alternate the position of the natural monologue - leading or\ntrailing the audio - across different training stages.

GRMM\nprovides disentangled control through low-dimensional, interpretable parameters\n(e.g., identity shape, facial expressions) while separately modelling residuals\nthat capture subject- and expression-specific detail beyond the base model's\ncapacity. Coarse decoders produce vertex-level mesh deformations, fine decoders\nrepresent per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN refines rasterised\nimages for enhanced realism, all while maintaining 75 FPS real-time rendering.\nTo learn consistent, high-fidelity residuals, we present EXPRESS-50, the first\ndataset with 60 aligned expressions across 50 identities, enabling robust\ndisentanglement of identity and expression in Gaussian-based 3DMMs. Across\nmonocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view synthesis, and expression\ntransfer, GRMM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and expression\naccuracy while delivering interactive real-time performance."}

While $t^3$VAE improves robustness\nvia heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent\nvolume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this\nissue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes.\nTo this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class\n\\mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing\ndominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form\nobjective derived from the $\\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for\nclass-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of\nStudent's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA,\nConditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE\nand Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In\nper-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional\nGaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings.

In\nthis paper, we introduce PyramidAI, a technique for analyzing gigapixel images\nwith reduced computational cost. The proposed approach adopts a gradual\nanalysis of the image, beginning with lower resolutions and progressively\nconcentrating on regions of interest for detailed examination at higher\nresolutions. We investigated two strategies for tuning the accuracy-computation\nperformance trade-off when implementing the adaptive resolution selection,\nvalidated against the Camelyon16 dataset of biomedical images. Our results\ndemonstrate that PyramidAI substantially decreases the amount of processed data\nrequired for analysis by up to 2.65x, while preserving the accuracy in\nidentifying relevant sections on a single computer. To ensure democratization\nof gigapixel image analysis, we evaluated the potential to use mainstream\ncomputers to perform the computation by exploiting the parallelism potential of\nthe approach. Using a simulator, we estimated the best data distribution and\nload balancing algorithm according to the number of workers.

We\npresent AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device\nassistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,\nclosed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this\nposition through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,\ntraining, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile\napplication development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal\nfoundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and\ncontrol layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task\nplanning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution\nlayer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice\ninteraction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and\ncomprehensive mobile app support.

In\ncontrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such\nas distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.\nSince such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth\ncameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual\ncapabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation\nis challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to\nvarious types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as\na simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth\nsignals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,\nwe develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from\nsimulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that\nCDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively\nbridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments\ndemonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,\nwithout the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes\nseamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving\narticulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance\ndegradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing\nsimulation data and 3D information in general robot policies."}
