To address these limitations, we propose a\nunified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety\nbehaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and\nrejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,\neach behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,\nor magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at\ninference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as\npositive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and\nrejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.\nThis co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the\noutput space, characterized by well-separated response distributions\ncorresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides\nempirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented\nfine-grained control.

To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce\na unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate\n300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on\napproaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based\ntext generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics\nand representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges\nand outline promising directions for future work."}

To interpret\nexisting VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool\nand design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and\nLanguage-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different\nnumbers of layers (window of layers).

To address these limitations, we employ a\nknowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models\nwith prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student\nmodel. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal\nknowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)\nparadigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with\nSD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with\nprior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge\ntransfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,\nwe introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D\nPatch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked\nSemantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive\nexperiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves\nthe student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously\naccelerating inference speed.

However, their global denoising process\ninherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading\nto unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing\ninstructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by\nformulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual\ntokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the\nadherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present\nVAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as\na next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text\ninstructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise\nedits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the\nsource image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot\neffectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this\ngap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects\nscale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.\nVAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and\nefficiency.

However, when interacting with untrusted data sources\n(e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain\ninjected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to\nmalicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI).\nExisting defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary\ndetection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness,\nthey fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security,\nwhich lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents\nstill retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable\nto stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the\nmodel. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel\ndefensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents'\ntask execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph\n(TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external\ndata, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by\ninjected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.\nExperiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior\nbalance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the\ndevelopment of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments."}

Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,\nbut their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor\nfeedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce\nDeep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement\nlearning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for\nmedical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical\nretrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge\nsources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More\ncrutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its\nenvironment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,\nand diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from\nlarge-scale data through RL.\n  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework\nconsistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches\nacross multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves\nsubstantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic\nbaselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks\nfor both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and\nretrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the\nuniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional\nimplementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight\nimprovements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight\ninto its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more\nreliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

However, in high-value but\nmore challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely\non expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags\nsignificantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for\ntransforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between\nopen-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To\nmitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General\nIntelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped\nwith general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze\nmultiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmodel with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,\ncontinually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from\nscientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and\nthen online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose\nMixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks\nsimultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and\ntraining systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL\ntraining.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates\ncompetitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and\nsignificantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing\nclosed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular\nsynthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic\nstabilities for crystals.
