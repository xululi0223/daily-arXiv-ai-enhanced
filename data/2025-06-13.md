Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种跨文本、视觉和音频模态的生成内容自动评估方法的统一分类法，并识别了五种基本范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏一个系统性框架来全面组织跨模态的生成内容自动评估方法。

Method: 通过综述和分类法，分析文本生成评估方法，并扩展至图像和音频生成。

Result: 提出了一个适用于多模态的统一评估框架，并展示了其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 讨论了跨模态评估方法的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

### [2] [TaskCraft: Automated Generation of Agentic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10055)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaskCraft是一个自动化工作流，用于生成可扩展、多工具且可验证的代理任务，解决了现有指令数据缺乏工具交互和人工标注成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理任务在NLP和AI中的重要性日益增加，但现有数据和基准测试存在工具交互不足和人工标注成本高的问题。

Method: TaskCraft通过深度和广度扩展原子任务，生成结构化和层次化的复杂任务，并自动生成执行轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，这些任务改进了生成工作流中的提示优化，并提升了代理基础模型的监督微调效果。

Conclusion: TaskCraft提供了一个大规模合成数据集（约36,000个任务），支持未来代理调优和评估的研究。

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool
use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the
advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool
interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation,
limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated
workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic
tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic
dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future
research on agent tuning and evaluation.

*Christopher J. Agostino,Quan Le Thien,Molly Apsel,Denizhan Pak,Elina Lesyk,Ashabari Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了语义退化对自然语言处理的影响，提出意义是通过观察者依赖的诠释行为实现的，并通过实验验证了语言诠释的非经典性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示大型语言模型（LLMs）和其他NLP系统在处理复杂语义表达时的固有局限性，以及语义退化对意义恢复的影响。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov复杂性理论分析语义退化的计算不可行性，并通过语义贝尔不等式实验，利用LLMs作为计算认知系统测试模糊词对的诠释。

Result: 实验结果显示CHSH期望值在1.2到2.8之间，部分结果显著违反经典边界（|S|≤2），表明语言诠释具有非经典上下文性。

Conclusion: 结论指出经典频率分析方法在自然语言处理中存在局限性，建议采用贝叶斯式重复采样方法更有效地表征语境中的语言意义。

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业设备监控领域需要高效生成FMEA文档，但传统方法存在挑战，如内容迭代和验证效率低。

Method: 采用多角色协作的LLM智能体，通过动态任务路由和Chat of Thought机制实现内容迭代优化。

Result: 系统能够高效生成和验证FMEA表格，解决了工业设备监控中的关键挑战。

Conclusion: Chat-of-Thought展示了多智能体协作在工业领域的潜力，为FMEA文档生成提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel multi-agent system called Chat-of-Thought,
designed to facilitate the generation of Failure Modes and Effects Analysis
(FMEA) documents for industrial assets. Chat-of-Thought employs multiple
collaborative Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents with specific roles,
leveraging advanced AI techniques and dynamic task routing to optimize the

the introduction of a Chat of Thought, where dynamic, multi-persona-driven
discussions enable iterative refinement of content. This research explores the
application domain of industrial equipment monitoring, highlights key
challenges, and demonstrates the potential of Chat-of-Thought in addressing
these challenges through interactive, template-driven workflows and
context-aware agent collaboration.

### [5] [When Meaning Stays the Same, but Models Drift: Evaluating Quality of Service under Token-Level Behavioral Instability in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10095)
*Xiao Li,Joel Kreuzwieser,Alan Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型对语义相同但表达不同的提示（称为提示方差）的响应差异，提出了PBSS框架用于测量这种差异，并发现模型在语义等效提示下存在一致的响应偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型在语义相同但表达不同的提示下的行为差异，以揭示模型评估的稳定性问题。

Method: 提出Prompt-Based Semantic Shift (PBSS)框架，应用于十个约束任务，测量模型在语义等效提示下的行为漂移。

Result: 发现模型在语义等效提示下存在一致的响应偏移，表明分词和解码策略可能影响模型的服务质量稳定性。

Conclusion: 提示方差是模型评估中一个被忽视的维度，分词和解码策略可能影响模型性能的稳定性。

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

### [6] [ChartReasoner: Code-Driven Modality Bridging for Long-Chain Reasoning in Chart Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10116)
*Caijun Jia,Nan Xu,Jingxuan Wei,Qingli Wang,Lei Wang,Bihui Yu,Junnan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChartReasoner是一个两阶段框架，通过代码驱动方法解决视觉推理任务中的信息丢失问题，表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将视觉推理任务转换为文本推理任务时丢失关键信息，ChartReasoner旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 1. 训练高保真模型将图表转换为结构化ECharts代码；2. 设计数据合成管道生成推理轨迹；3. 结合监督微调和强化学习训练多模态模型。

Result: 在四个公开基准测试中表现优异，接近GPT-4o性能，且参数更少。

Conclusion: ChartReasoner能有效保留图表细节，性能接近专有系统，适用于跨领域任务。

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

*Jiaxin Wen,Zachary Ankner,Arushi Somani,Peter Hase,Samuel Marks,Jacob Goldman-Wetzler,Linda Petrini,Henry Sleight,Collin Burns,He He,Shi Feng,Ethan Perez,Jan Leike*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督算法ICM，用于在没有外部监督的情况下微调预训练语言模型，使其在超人类能力任务上表现优于人类监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的后训练范式依赖人类指定行为，但对于超人类能力的模型，高质量人类监督难以获取。

Method: 引入内部一致性最大化（ICM）算法，利用模型自身生成的标签进行微调。

Result: 在多个任务上，ICM表现与黄金监督相当，优于众包人类监督；在超人类能力任务上显著优于人类标签训练。

Conclusion: ICM方法可提升前沿语言模型的训练效果，其无监督奖励模型和助手均优于人类监督版本。

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

### [8] [When Large Language Models are Reliable for Judging Empathic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10150)
*Aakriti Kumar,Nalin Poungpeth,Diyi Yang,Erina Farrell,Bruce Lambert,Matthew Groh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了专家、众包工作者和LLM在四种心理学、NLP和传播学框架下对共情沟通的标注可靠性，发现LLM接近专家水平，优于众包工作者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在共情沟通中的判断可靠性，为情感敏感应用提供透明度和监督。

Method: 比较专家、众包工作者和LLM在四种框架下对200个真实对话的共情标注，分析评分者间一致性。

Result: 专家一致性高但受框架子成分影响；LLM接近专家水平，优于众包工作者。

Conclusion: LLM在特定任务中表现可靠，可作为情感敏感应用的监督工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在孟加拉语社交媒体评论中进行情感分析的方法，使用了多种机器学习模型和特征提取技术，并尝试通过LIME解释模型预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是提升资源有限语言（如孟加拉语）的情感分析能力，尤其是针对具有独特地区表达和文化特征的未充分研究语言。

Method: 方法包括使用Linear SVM、KNN、Random Forest等机器学习模型，结合TF-IDF向量化的n-gram数据，并探索PCA降维效果。此外，还采用了BiLSTM模型和AdaBoost提升决策树，并使用LIME解释AdaBoost分类器的预测。

Result: 研究结果为多种技术在孟加拉语情感分析中的表现提供了实证，并展示了LIME在模型解释中的应用。

Conclusion: 结论表明，结合多种技术和模型解释工具可以有效提升资源有限语言的情感分析效果。

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and
cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using
22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

*Elizabeth Demers,Victor Xiaoqi Wang,Kean Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机器学习的词汇表开发方法，用于衡量和披露人力资本（HC）的多维度管理，并提供了相关数据和代码供未来研究使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人力资本对企业价值创造日益重要，但目前缺乏明确的衡量和披露规则，因此需要开发一种系统化的方法来捕捉HC的多维度特征。

Method: 使用word2vec算法训练一组确认的HC披露数据，开发了一个包含五个子类别的HC相关关键词词汇表，并提供了Python代码和BERT模型微调示例。

Result: 开发了一个全面的HC词汇表，并公开了相关数据、代码和示例，为研究者提供了工具以解决HC相关问题。

Conclusion: 论文为HC管理研究提供了实用工具，并讨论了未来研究方向，强调了HC披露的重要性。

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

### [11] [Can LLMs Generate Good Stories? Insights and Challenges from a Narrative Planning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10161)
*Yi Wang,Max Kreminski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在故事生成中的能力，通过叙事规划问题评估其表现，发现GPT-4级别模型在小规模故事生成中因果性良好，但角色意图和戏剧冲突仍具挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs生成高质量故事的能力受限，因自动评估方法不足且人工评估成本高、主观性强。计算叙事学为评估提供了新视角。

Method: 通过叙事规划问题评估LLMs，基于文学示例设计基准，关注因果合理性、角色意图性和戏剧冲突。

Result: GPT-4级别模型能生成小规模因果合理的故事，但角色意图和戏剧冲突需强化学习训练的LLMs支持复杂推理。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在不同规模故事生成中的能力边界，为游戏环境中应用LLM叙事规划提供了挑战与启示。

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

*Shubhashis Roy Dipta,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Q2E是一种零样本多语言文本到视频检索方法，通过分解查询利用LLMs和VLMs的潜在知识，提升复杂事件视频检索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进复杂现实世界事件的视频识别与检索，利用LLMs和VLMs的潜在参数知识。

Method: 提出Q2E方法，分解查询并利用LLMs和VLMs的知识，结合熵基融合评分处理多模态输入。

Result: 在多个数据集和检索指标上优于现有基线方法，音频信息显著提升检索效果。

Conclusion: Q2E有效提升视频检索性能，多模态融合是关键，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

*Prakamya Mishra,Jiang Liu,Jialian Wu,Xiaodong Yu,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TTT-Bench是一个新基准，用于评估大型推理模型（LRMs）在简单战略、空间和逻辑推理任务中的表现，发现擅长数学问题的模型在这些简单游戏中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LRMs在STEM领域表现出色，但其在更广泛任务领域的推理能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过设计四种类似井字棋的双人游戏，生成可验证的问题集，评估模型的推理能力。

Result: 模型在TTT-Bench上的表现比数学基准低41%和5%，且大模型在长程战略推理中表现较差。

Conclusion: LRMs在简单推理任务中存在明显不足，尤其是在战略和空间推理方面。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

*Anneliese Brei,Katharine Henry,Abhisheik Sharma,Shashank Srivastava,Snigdha Chaturvedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种计算方法来识别不可靠的叙述者，并发布了一个多领域的人类标注数据集TUNa。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过计算手段识别叙述者是否可靠，尤其是那些无意中歪曲信息的叙述者。

Method: 结合文学理论定义不可靠叙述者类型，构建TUNa数据集，并测试多种LLM在分类任务中的表现。

Result: 任务极具挑战性，但LLMs在识别不可靠叙述者方面有潜力。

Conclusion: 发布数据集和代码，鼓励未来研究。

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

*Iago Alves Brito,Julia Soares Dollis,Fernanda Bufon Färber,Diogo Fernandes Costa Silva,Arlindo Rodrigues Galvão Filho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToxSyn-PT是首个大规模葡萄牙语语料库，支持对九个受法律保护的少数群体进行细粒度的仇恨言论分类。通过四阶段流程生成，实验表明其在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决葡萄牙语中缺乏细粒度仇恨言论分类数据集的问题，特别是在低资源环境下。

Method: 采用四阶段流程：手动精选种子、少样本扩展、基于释义的增强和中性文本补充。

Result: 生成的语料库类别平衡、风格多样，实验显示其在多个葡萄牙语仇恨言论数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT为合成数据和低资源环境下的仇恨言论检测研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing

experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: 语言模型在特定条件下可能表现出近乎确定性的决策行为，挑战了其作为概率分布的假设，并揭示了模拟Gibbs采样可能导致的“虚假先验”问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否具有贝叶斯大脑的特性，以及其决策行为的本质。

Method: 通过实验分析大型语言模型在不同条件下的决策模式，提出区分随机与确定性决策的方法。

Result: 语言模型在非零采样温度下仍可能产生最大似然估计，表现出确定性行为，模拟Gibbs采样可能导致虚假先验。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型决策行为的复杂性，为理解其决策机制提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于聚类和改进UCB算法的高效梯度数据选择框架ClusterUCB，显著减少计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度数据选择方法计算资源消耗过大，难以实际应用。

Method: 通过聚类将数据分组，利用改进的UCB算法解决计算预算分配问题，平衡探索与利用。

Result: 实验表明ClusterUCB在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算消耗。

Conclusion: ClusterUCB是一种高效且实用的梯度数据选择方法。

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Flick的新方法，用于解决低资源语言环境下的少标签文本分类问题，通过改进伪标签质量提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对大量标注数据的依赖，解决现有方法在低资源语言中伪标签噪声和领域适应问题。

Method: Flick引入了一种新颖的伪标签细化组件，通过高置信度伪标签蒸馏和自适应top-k选择机制提升伪标签质量。

Result: 在14个多样化数据集（包括阿拉伯语、乌尔都语等低资源语言）上验证了Flick的优越性能和适应性。

Conclusion: Flick通过改进伪标签质量，显著提升了低资源语言环境下的少标签分类效果。

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

### [19] ["Check My Work?": Measuring Sycophancy in a Simulated Educational Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10297)
*Chuck Arvin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，用户提供的建议会影响大型语言模型（LLMs）在教育模拟中的表现，尤其是在学生提到错误答案时，模型正确率可能下降15%，而提到正确答案时则提升15%。这种偏差在较小模型中更显著（如GPT-4.1-nano偏差达30%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在教育场景中因用户建议产生的偏差（如迎合行为）及其对教育公平的影响。

Method: 测试了OpenAI的GPT-4o和GPT-4.1类别的五个LLMs，通过五种实验条件分析回答质量变化。

Result: 模型倾向于根据学生提到的答案调整回答，且较小模型偏差更大。这种迎合行为可能加剧教育不平等。

Conclusion: 需深入研究此类偏差机制并开发缓解方法，以确保LLMs在教育中的公平应用。

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过交替训练语音和文本来解决LLMs在语音到语音翻译中模态适应问题的方法，实验表明该方法能显著提升翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在语音到语音翻译（S2ST）中面临模态适应问题，因为它们仅基于文本数据训练，而语音数据有限。

Method: 采用计划性交替语音-文本训练方法，逐步减少文本比例以促进模态适应。

Result: 在CVSS数据集上微调LLaMA3.2-1B，该方法显著提升了翻译性能，尤其对数据稀缺的语言效果更佳。

Conclusion: 交替训练方法有效解决了模态适应问题，提升了语音到语音翻译的性能。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

Conclusion: 该方法能生成高精度推理数据，优化推理效率。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理异构文档时存在局限性，尤其是表格结构的破坏和信息丢失，影响了多跳推理能力。

Method: TableRAG采用四步迭代框架：查询分解、文本检索、SQL编程与执行、中间答案生成，并开发了HeteQA基准进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，TableRAG在公共数据集和HeteQA上均优于现有基线，成为异构文档问答的新标杆。

Conclusion: TableRAG通过统一文本和表格处理，显著提升了异构文档的问答性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在自我验证输出正确性方面存在不足，现有方法依赖额外验证模型或多阶段训练，扩展性受限。

Method: 提出PAG框架，结合策略和验证者角色，通过选择性修正机制在多轮强化学习中实现自我验证和修正。

Result: PAG在多个推理基准测试中表现优异，提升了生成准确性和自我验证能力。

Conclusion: PAG框架简单有效，解决了LLM自我验证的扩展性问题，同时提升了推理和验证能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS,
with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also

Motivation: 现有冲突框架研究多为定性或浅层分析，缺乏深度。本研究旨在通过计算语言学方法揭示新闻框架对读者观点的影响。

Method: 结合框架语义学和大语言模型，分析新闻语料中的战争与和平新闻指标。

Result: 发现战争报道多于和平报道，且美、英和中东媒体在冲突描述上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 新闻框架在冲突报道中存在偏见，可能加剧冲突，需更深入的研究与反思。

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法如Chain-of-Thought提示虽能提升推理能力，但常导致输出过长，增加计算延迟。且现有强化学习方法对输出长度的惩罚过于统一，未考虑问题复杂性，导致效果不佳。

Method: 通过分割奖励函数并引入新的输出长度惩罚机制，动态管理模型的推理效率。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上，方法有效缩短输出长度且保持或提升准确性；在更复杂的AIME2024数据集上，准确性有所提高。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升推理效率的同时，兼顾了不同复杂度问题的准确性，为大语言模型的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

Motivation: 现有科学主张验证方法仅预测标签，缺乏对模型推理的解释性和可解释性。

Method: 将表格-文本对齐任务重新定义为解释任务，构建包含人工标注单元格的数据集，并提出处理模糊情况的分类法。

Result: 结合表格对齐信息提升了验证性能，但多数大语言模型无法恢复人类标注的推理路径。

Conclusion: 模型预测的正确性可能并非源于忠实推理，需进一步改进解释性。

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

Result: 预提示角色评估差异微小，但用户评分和薪资谈判任务中显示出显著偏见。

Conclusion: 随着LLM助手记忆和个性化趋势，模型已知用户社会人口特征，偏见问题需从新角度解决。

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

Result: 实验结果显示，与单用户DST相比，LLMs在多用户DST中的性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 研究强调了未来需要改进LLMs以应对多用户DST场景，以实现更现实和鲁棒的DST模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识密集型任务中表现不佳，主要因为缺乏背景知识和易产生幻觉。知识图谱虽能补充事实知识，但难以生成逻辑一致的推理路径。

Method: 提出RRP框架，结合LLM的语义能力和知识图谱的结构信息，通过关系嵌入和双向分布学习生成推理路径，并引入反思模块优化路径。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上，RRP表现优于现有基线方法，并能以即插即用方式增强多种LLM的推理能力。

Conclusion: RRP通过生成高质量推理路径，为LLM提供有效指导，提升其在复杂问题上的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA
2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The
task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a
mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1)
an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model
(LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples,
constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce
interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for
pedagogical feedback assessment. Our code is available at

*Tatsuya Hiraoka,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs能逐字符拼写但难以处理复杂字符任务，研究发现其字符级信息处理依赖中间层而非嵌入层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在拼写过程中如何内部表示和利用字符级信息。

Method: 通过探测分类器、知识神经元识别和注意力权重检查三种分析验证机制。

Result: LLMs的嵌入层未完全编码字符级信息，依赖中间层重建知识，拼写行为存在“突破”。

Conclusion: LLMs的字符级处理依赖中间层，嵌入层信息有限。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLMs）的方法来检测威胁生命的语言，并与传统方法（如词袋模型、词嵌入、主题建模和BERT）进行了比较。实验表明，LLMs在平衡和不平衡数据场景下均表现优异，尤其是Mistral和Llama-2模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测威胁生命的语言对于保护处于困境中的个体、促进心理健康以及预防潜在伤害至关重要。

Method: 研究微调了三种开源LLMs（Gemma、Mistral和Llama-2的7B参数版本），并在不同数据平衡场景下进行了实验，同时采用了上采样技术处理不平衡数据。

Result: 实验结果显示，LLMs在性能上显著优于传统方法，其中Mistral和Llama-2表现最佳，而Gemma稍逊。上采样对传统方法有益，但对LLMs影响较小。

Conclusion: 研究表明，LLMs在现实世界的威胁生命语言检测问题中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

TL;DR: PREMISE框架通过提示优化减少大型推理模型的冗余计算，保持准确性同时显著降低成本和令牌使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型推理模型在数学推理中因冗长链式思维导致的令牌和成本过高问题，适用于延迟敏感或API受限场景。

Method: 结合跟踪级诊断和梯度启发式提示优化，通过多目标文本搜索平衡令牌长度和答案有效性。

Result: 在GSM8K、SVAMP和Math500上保持或提升准确率（Claude 96%→96%，Gemini 91%→92%），令牌减少87.5%，成本降低69-82%。

Conclusion: 提示级优化是高效推理的实用且可扩展方法，不影响推理质量。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimSpect框架通过层次化分解和检索增强生成，为复杂声明提供多角度验证和视角分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂声明（如科学或政治声明）难以简单标记为真或假的问题，提供更全面的验证方法。

Method: 提出ClaimSpect框架，通过检索增强生成技术构建声明层次结构，并基于语料库检索相关片段以发现子方面和不同视角。

Result: 在真实科学和政治声明数据集上验证了框架的鲁棒性和准确性，优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: ClaimSpect能有效解构复杂声明并展示语料库中的多视角，适用于科学和政治领域。

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学领域快速演变，传统分类方法耗时且昂贵，现有自动方法缺乏通用性和动态适应性。TaxoAdapt旨在填补这些空白。

Method: TaxoAdapt通过迭代层次分类动态扩展分类的宽度和深度，适应多维科学文献。

Result: TaxoAdapt在计算机科学会议数据上表现优异，分类更细粒度且更连贯，优于基线26.51%和50.41%。

Conclusion: TaxoAdapt能有效捕捉科学领域演变，生成更优的多维分类。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大模型预训练面临模型容量有限、高质量数据稀缺和计算资源限制，且分词器对新语言覆盖不足，影响后期适应能力。

Method: 提出使用通用分词器，覆盖比预训练语言更多的语言，以提升模型对新语言的适应能力。

Result: 通用分词器显著提升语言适应性，适应性提升达20.2%，对完全未见语言的适应性提升达5%。

Conclusion: 通用分词器在扩展语言覆盖范围的同时，对预训练语言的性能影响极小，是一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

Abstract: Accurate and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates are essential for
deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as clinical
decision support. We present a fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
estimation methods for clinical multiple-choice question answering, covering
ten open-source LLMs (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models) across
two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. We compare
standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study
exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in
reasoning traces. These lightweight methods approach the performance of
Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal
substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the
importance of selecting models based on both the nature of the question and
model-specific strengths.

Motivation: 当前ASR系统在通用语音识别上表现优异，但对命名实体的识别错误率仍较高，而命名实体是关键信息，错误会影响下游应用。

Method: 引入LLM修正机制，利用LLM的推理能力和包含正确命名实体的本地上下文（如讲义）来修正ASR预测中的命名实体错误。

Result: 在NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare数据集上，该方法实现了命名实体WER相对降低30%。

Conclusion: LLM修正机制能有效提升ASR系统对命名实体的识别准确性，为下游应用提供更可靠的前端支持。

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言知识更新在大型语言模型中是一个长期未解决的挑战，传统方法成本高且易导致参数干扰。

Method: LangEdit通过将每种语言的参数更新投影到先前更新子空间的正交补空间，确保更新独立性。

Result: 在三种模型架构、六种语言和四项下游任务中，LangEdit显著优于现有方法，有效减少了参数干扰。

Conclusion: LangEdit为多语言知识更新提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

Result: 在多个数学推理数据集上，ReCUT显著减少推理长度30-50%，同时保持或提高准确性。

Conclusion: ReCUT有效平衡推理长度和准确性，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data
will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有dLLMs采样策略（如基于置信度或半自回归解码）存在静态行为问题，导致效率低下和灵活性不足。

Method: 提出SlowFast Sampling，基于三个黄金原则（确定性、收敛性和位置性）动态调整解码阶段，并结合dLLM-Cache优化计算。

Result: 在LLaDA上实现15.63倍速度提升，结合缓存可达34.22倍，且准确率下降极小，吞吐量优于LLaMA3 8B等自回归基线。

Conclusion: SlowFast Sampling证明了精心设计的采样策略能充分发挥dLLMs的潜力，实现快速高质量生成。

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Conclusion: wav2vec2的表示结构主要独立于预训练语言材料。

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language

TL;DR: MedRef是一种新型医疗对话系统，通过知识精炼和动态提示调整，解决了现有系统在识别相关医学知识和生成个性化准确响应方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗对话系统难以准确识别医学知识并生成个性化响应，MedRef旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用知识精炼机制过滤无关医学数据，设计综合提示结构，并实现Triplet Filter和Demo Selector模块以动态调整。

Result: 在MedDG和KaMed基准测试中，MedRef在生成质量和医学实体准确性上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: MedRef在真实医疗应用中表现出高效性和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)
generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these
challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining
and dynamic prompt adjustment. First, we employ a knowledge refining mechanism
to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical
medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG
and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its
effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates and validates the impact of fine-tuning on large

performance strongly depends on alignment between fine-tuning dataset and
benchmark tasks. The study provides both theoretical insights into
parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for developers
implementing efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）在微调过程中表现出的双重性：既能从新事实中泛化，又容易产生幻觉信息。研究发现这两种行为源于同一种机制——上下文外推理（OCR），并通过实验和理论分析验证了OCR的作用及其数学基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解LLMs在知识获取中表现出的双重性（泛化与幻觉），并揭示其背后的机制。

Method: 通过实验验证OCR在五种主流LLMs中的作用，并设计合成事实回忆任务，分析单层单头注意力变换器的学习能力。

Result: 实验证实OCR驱动泛化和幻觉，矩阵分解是关键；理论分析表明梯度下降的隐式偏好解释了OCR的高效学习能力。

Conclusion: 研究为OCR现象提供了理论基础，为分析和缓解知识注入中的不良行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

TL;DR: BioClinical ModernBERT是一种针对生物医学和临床NLP优化的编码器模型，通过大规模预训练和多源数据适应，显著提升了性能和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学和临床NLP中的编码器模型发展较慢，现有模型在领域适应性和性能上存在局限。

Method: 基于ModernBERT，通过53.5B token的大规模预训练和20个多源数据集的适应，开发了BioClinical ModernBERT。

Result: 在四个下游任务中表现优于现有生物医学和临床编码器。

Conclusion: BioClinical ModernBERT为生物医学和临床NLP提供了高效的解决方案，并开源支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LLM的系统性自动评估方法（EFG），用于改进高级数学领域中的自动形式化任务评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动形式化评估在复杂数学领域中缺乏精细化的方法，而人工评估耗时且依赖专业知识。

Method: 采用基于逻辑保存（LP）、数学一致性（MC）、形式有效性（FV）和形式质量（FQ）的LLM评委集成（EFG）。

Result: EFG方法比粗粒度模型更接近人工评估，尤其在形式质量评估上表现更优。

Conclusion: LLM评委在明确原子属性指导下，可为形式数学推理提供可扩展、可解释且可靠的评估支持。

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

Conclusion: Magistral证明了纯RL训练在LLMs中的潜力，同时开源了部分模型以促进社区发展。

Abstract: We introduce Magistral, Mistral's first reasoning model and our own scalable
reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. Instead of relying on existing
implementations and RL traces distilled from prior models, we follow a ground
up approach, relying solely on our own models and infrastructure. Notably, we
demonstrate a stack that enabled us to explore the limits of pure RL training
of LLMs, present a simple method to force the reasoning language of the model,
and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's
capabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal
understanding, instruction following and function calling. We present Magistral
Medium, trained for reasoning on top of Mistral Medium 3 with RL alone, and we
open-source Magistral Small (Apache 2.0) which further includes cold-start data
from Magistral Medium.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于半非负矩阵分解（SNMF）的方法，用于分解MLP激活，以识别可解释的特征，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如稀疏自编码器）在因果评估中表现不佳且缺乏内在可解释性，因此需要一种更直接的方法来分解模型激活。

Method: 使用半非负矩阵分解（SNMF）直接分解MLP激活，学习稀疏线性组合的神经元特征，并将其映射到激活输入。

Result: 在Llama 3.1、Gemma 2和GPT-2上的实验表明，SNMF特征在因果导向和人类可解释性上优于稀疏自编码器和监督基线。

Conclusion: SNMF是一种简单有效的工具，可用于识别可解释特征并揭示LLM中概念表示的层次结构。

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Result: 模型能有效预测对话中的信念更新，并可进一步复杂化以适应现实对话场景。

Conclusion: 动态认知摩擦模型为LLMs对齐提供了新视角，未来可扩展以应对更复杂的对话需求。

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

TL;DR: Domain2Vec是一种新方法，通过将数据集分解为多个元域的线性组合，优化语言模型预训练的数据混合选择，显著减少计算开销并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决语言模型预训练中数据混合选择的问题，提出了一种无需训练即可优化数据分布对齐的方法。

Method: Domain2Vec通过分类器将数据集分解为元域向量，利用分布对齐假设（DA²）找到最优数据混合。

Result: 实验表明，Domain2Vec仅需51.5%的计算量即可达到相同验证损失，并在相同计算预算下平均提升2.83%的下游任务性能。

Conclusion: Domain2Vec是一种高效且可扩展的方法，能够显著优化语言模型预训练的数据选择过程。

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in
scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and

Conclusion: AutoMind是迈向完全自动化数据科学的高效且稳健的一步。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

Result: 模型能识别无效思维但恢复能力差，大模型表现更糟，小模型对有害思维更不敏感。

Conclusion: 需改进模型的自我评估能力以提升推理和安全性。

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效且灵活的视频编辑解决方案，适用于特定编辑需求。

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在多种图像分类基准测试中，DeepTraverse表现出色，分类准确性和特征区分能力优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，引入算法先验是构建高效、高性能且结构化视觉主干网络的有效策略。

Abstract: Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct
features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited
explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling
question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more
algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks,
leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps
reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision
architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to
learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive
refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes
this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that
methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths
with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that
dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The
resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct
and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite
of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly
competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often
outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our
work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a
principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and
structured vision backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action模型的计算和内存需求高，现有加速方法未能全面解决其瓶颈，限制了实际部署。

Method: EfficientVLA整合了三种策略：语言模块的层剪枝、视觉处理路径的任务感知优化，以及扩散动作头的特征缓存复用。

Result: 在CogACT模型上，EfficientVLA实现了1.93倍的推理加速，FLOPs降至28.9%，成功率仅下降0.6%。

Conclusion: EfficientVLA通过系统性冗余消除，显著提升了VLA模型的效率和实用性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based
architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence
but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming
from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing
acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal
solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and
memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical
deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free
inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers
by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA
synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of
functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an
analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing
pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of
visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3)
alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative
diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key
intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT,
yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6%
success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

Result: 最佳检测方法的真阳性率为75.3%，显示未成年人检测具有挑战性。

Conclusion: ICCWD数据集有望帮助设计更优的未成年人检测方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Platforms and the law regulate digital content depicting minors (defined as
individuals under 18 years of age) differently from other types of content.
Given the sheer amount of content that needs to be assessed, machine
learning-based automation tools are commonly used to detect content depicting
minors. To our knowledge, no dataset or benchmark currently exists for
detecting these identification methods in a multi-modal environment. To fill
this gap, we release the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), an
image-caption dataset aimed at benchmarking tools that detect depictions of
minors. Our dataset is richer than previous child image datasets, containing
images of children in a variety of contexts, including fictional depictions and
partially visible bodies. ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually
labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To
demonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three
different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to
images. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with
the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate. We hope the release of
our dataset will aid in the design of better minor detection methods in a wide
range of scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

Conclusion: RoCA为端到端自动驾驶的跨域部署提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm,
offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the
practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although
several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their
open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance
and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this
paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E
autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over
the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E
pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of
basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving
scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer
the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in
source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,
without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust
adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct
finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and
show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

Conclusion: SPARKE方法有效解决了提示感知多样性的问题，同时降低了计算复杂度，适用于大规模生成任务。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

Conclusion: 模型能够隐式学习表面反射率动态，尤其在山区效果显著，提升了泛化能力。代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery
critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne
sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline
can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models
in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms
typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming
surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However,
this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and
changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for
SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance
from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision
Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as
explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous
SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region
characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include
multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,
augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target
variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse
horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We
show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model
matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's
ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.
Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous
regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic
settings. Code and datasets are publicly available at

Motivation: 由于线性探测（LP）无法充分评估掩码图像建模（MIM）模型的潜力，且现有注意力探测方法存在参数过多和计算效率低的问题，本文旨在提出一种更高效的探测方法。

Method: 引入高效探测（EP），采用多查询交叉注意力机制，减少冗余投影和可训练参数，提升计算效率。

Conclusion: EP是一种高效、通用的探测方法，适用于多种预训练范式，并能生成可解释的注意力图。

Abstract: As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is
emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning
(SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the
potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the
distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive
probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate
patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains
under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization
and poor computational efficiency.
  In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the
accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing
methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We
introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that
eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters,
and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head
attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive
probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to
diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and
achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings. Code available at

Result: 在两个基准测试中，个性化检索准确率比现有方法提高4%-22%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在个性化检索任务中表现优异，同时有效保留了通用知识。

Abstract: Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g.
"my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it
requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also
integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the
concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt
the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for
personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank
adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer
serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing
the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we
explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal
concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well
general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a
metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a
vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on
two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries -
DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal
retrievals.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

Abstract: California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5%
of the United States total output and ranking as the fifth-largest food and
cotton supplier in the world. Despite the availability of extensive historical
yield data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, accurate and
timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay
of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors. In this study, we
introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops
across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates
diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate
records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To
effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal
deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting.
The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs
such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability.
Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen
test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California
diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a
valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation,
and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到65.31 NDS和57.4 mAP，验证集上56.2 NDS和46.2 mAP，实时推理速度33 FPS。

Conclusion: DySS在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，适用于自动驾驶感知任务。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most
important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense
BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse
query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries
and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,
we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic
queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to
sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to
encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence
information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked
reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an
informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space
learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and
split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries
throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection
performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,
DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the
art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a
real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.

Result: HalLoc数据集和基线模型可无缝集成到现有视觉语言模型中，提升可靠性同时保持效率。

Conclusion: HalLoc为增强视觉语言模型在现实应用中的可信度提供了新途径。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large
vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy
in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on
computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands.
Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where
the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address
these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient,
probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated
samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA),
instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the
development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence,
enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline
model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination

TL;DR: 该研究评估了基于深度学习的皮肤病变分类方法，结合迁移学习和不确定性量化，发现CLIP-based视觉变换器性能最佳，且集成方法在准确性和不确定性处理间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌的准确诊断对早期治疗至关重要，但现有深度学习方法受限于数据稀缺和缺乏不确定性意识。

Method: 研究分两阶段：1) 评估多种预训练特征提取器和传统分类器的组合；2) 引入不确定性量化方法（MCD、集成、EMCD）并评估其性能。

Result: CLIP-based视觉变换器（如LAION CLIP ViT-H/14与SVM结合）表现最佳；集成方法在准确性和不确定性处理间表现均衡，EMCD对不确定预测更敏感。

Conclusion: 将不确定性量化融入深度学习可提升医学诊断的性能和可信度，对临床实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌是全球最常见的癌症形式，每年医疗支出超过80亿美元。手动生成SOAP笔记耗时且导致临床医生疲劳。

Method: 采用弱监督多模态框架，结合病变图像和稀疏临床文本生成SOAP笔记。

Result: 性能与GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro相当，并引入了MedConceptEval和CCS两项新指标评估临床质量。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展且临床实用，减轻了临床医生负担，减少了对大量标注数据的需求。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

Abstract: In response to the rising prominence of the Metaverse, omnidirectional videos
(ODVs) have garnered notable interest, gradually shifting from
professional-generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC). However,
the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains
limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio
and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two
different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10
different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset
to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to
facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective
AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model
consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and
audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在零样本提示下分析学生学术情绪（如困惑、分心、快乐等）的潜力，发现Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct表现优于Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct，尤其在识别快乐和困惑情绪方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法难以泛化到不同情境，需反复数据收集和训练。VLMs提供了一种无需微调即可跨任务泛化的新方法。

Method: 使用两种VLMs（Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct和Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct）对5,000张学生面部表情图像进行零样本提示分析。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct表现更优，尤其在识别快乐和困惑情绪上；两种模型均无法检测分心行为。

Conclusion: VLMs在学术情绪分析中具有潜力，尤其是Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct在识别困惑情绪上的表现，可应用于实际教学场景。

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于点特征感知的高斯泼溅框架，用于稀疏训练视图下的实时高质量渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法需要大量校准视图，稀疏输入时容易过拟合，导致渲染质量下降。

Method: 利用立体基础模型估计相机姿态和密集点云，通过多尺度2D特征编码和自注意力网络增强点间交互，最终解码为高斯参数进行渲染。

Result: 在多种基准测试中显著优于NeRF方法，在少样本设置下与最先进的3DGS方法竞争。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了稀疏视图下的渲染质量问题，提升了3D高斯泼溅的实用性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that
surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual
quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS
approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent
and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to
overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering
quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware
Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering
from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo
foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense
point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes
of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance
features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation,
we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,
allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These
enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two
lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under
few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时满足遵循文本指令和聚焦局部部分的需求，GeoCAD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出互补标注策略（顶点和VLLM标注），训练时随机掩码局部部分，利用LLM预测；推理时用户可指定局部修改。

Result: 实验表明GeoCAD在生成质量、有效性和文本-CAD一致性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: GeoCAD成功实现了局部几何可控的CAD生成，代码将开源。

Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to
modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It
also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow
user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a
rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter
challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability
to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To
address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local
geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a
complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local
parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for
systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way,
we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage,
given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric
instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models
(LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any
local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in
generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be
available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/GeoCAD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于地理、历史和社会政治因素的差异，城市文化和建筑风格在不同城市间差异显著。传统研究方法依赖专家解读和历史文献，难以标准化。

Method: 构建了UrbanDiffBench数据集，开发了基于视觉语言模型的框架UrbanSense，用于定量生成和比较城市风格表示。

Result: 实验结果显示，超过80%的生成描述通过t检验（p<0.05），主观评价的高Phi分数（城市0.912，时期0.833）表明方法能捕捉细微风格差异。

Conclusion: 该方法为量化城市风格演变提供了科学依据，对未来设计具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

TL;DR: RealKeyMorph (RKM) 是一种分辨率无关的医学图像配准方法，避免了传统方法中因重采样引入的伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像配准中，不同分辨率的图像配准需求普遍存在，但现有机器学习方法需固定分辨率重采样，导致伪影。

Method: RKM 扩展了 KeyMorph 框架，通过输出真实世界坐标的关键点，利用扫描仪的仿射矩阵实现分辨率无关配准。

Result: 实验证明 RKM 在腹部 MRI 和脑部数据集的配准任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: RKM 提供了一种无需重采样的高效配准方法，适用于多分辨率医学图像。

Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images
that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image
acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view.
However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample
images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can
introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present
RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is
an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a
network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after
which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation
that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM
outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we
leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that
encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By
transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the
training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be
resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM
on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as
3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

Method: 提出Motion-R1框架，集成Chain-of-Thought机制分解指令，并采用Group Relative Policy Optimization强化学习算法联合优化推理链和运动合成。

Conclusion: Motion-R1通过逻辑分解和联合优化，显著提升了文本到运动生成的性能，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language
understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion
generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic
alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping
strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical
reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,
consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,
a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into
logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic
guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to
interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich
commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages
motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis
jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic
understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will
be publicly available.

Abstract: The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing
attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent
results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often
utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the
inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can
lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address
this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the
Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The
FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module
designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This
FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of
extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an
improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global
context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and
quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality
and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any
modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion.
Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of
FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 本文不仅提供了对自注意力机制的理论解释，还通过实验验证了其改进效果，为后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究海底物体埋藏状态对局部沉积动力学、生态风险评估及污染物迁移分析至关重要，但现有遥感图像方法难以准确估计埋藏深度。

Method: 结合深度基础模型特征与多视角摄影测量，通过ROV视频估计物体六自由度姿态及海底平面，并与CAD模型对齐推断埋藏深度。

Result: 在54个物体（如桶和弹药）的测试中，平均埋藏深度误差约10厘米，并能反映沉积物迁移过程的空间埋藏模式。

Conclusion: PoseIDON方法实现了非侵入式、可扩展的海底埋藏测绘，支持污染场地的环境评估。

Abstract: The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight
into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing
ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery
or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate
burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial
occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a
computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model
features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom
object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video.
Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed
imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is
validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions,
recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model
achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves
spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes.
This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and
supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.

Motivation: 现有非卷积模型（如ViT和Vim）依赖固定大小补丁，导致背景区域过度编码和关键局部细节丢失，尤其在稀疏分布信息对象时。

Method: DART结合可学习区域评分和分段可微分分位数操作，自适应分配更密集的标记到信息丰富区域。

Result: DART仅增加约1M参数，在DeiT（ImageNet-1K）上提升2.1%准确率，同时减少45% FLOPs。

Conclusion: DART在DeiT、Vim和VideoMamba上一致提升性能，计算开销极小甚至减少，为高效捕获细粒度细节提供了新方法。

Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and
Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision
tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive
encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details,
especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this,
we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),
which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying
sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable
quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.
Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,
DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that

TL;DR: 本文提出ReconMOST，一种基于数据驱动的扩散模型框架，用于多层海水温度重建，解决了传统方法在稀疏数据、算法复杂性和高计算成本方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的海洋重建对全球气候动力学和海洋气象研究至关重要，但传统方法受限于数据稀疏性和计算成本，机器学习方法也仅适用于表层或局部区域。

Method: 通过预训练无条件扩散模型学习历史数值模拟数据，生成阶段利用高精度原位观测数据作为反向扩散过程的引导点，实现准确重建。

Result: 在CMIP6和EN4数据上的实验显示，MSE值分别为0.049（引导）、0.680（重建）和0.633（总体），证明了框架的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ReconMOST将机器学习方法扩展到全球多层重建，处理了92.5%的缺失数据，同时保持精度和空间分辨率。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate
dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods
face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high
computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method
remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local
regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion
model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,
we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of
historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically
consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the
generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are
utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating
accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct
observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns
learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible
reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,
multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization
capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and
conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The
results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on
reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Our source code is

TL;DR: Pisces是一种新型的多模态基础模型，通过解耦视觉编码架构和优化的训练技术，在图像理解和生成任务中均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在多模态任务中取得进展，但统一模型在图像理解和生成任务中表现不如专用模型。Pisces旨在解决视觉特征和训练过程的差异问题。

Method: 采用解耦的视觉编码架构和优化的多模态生成训练技术，结合精细的数据处理、预训练和微调。

Result: 在20多个图像理解基准测试和GenEval图像生成基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: Pisces展示了图像理解与生成之间的协同关系，并验证了分离视觉编码器的优势，推动了统一多模态模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LRRNet的新型端到端红外小目标检测框架，利用红外图像背景的低秩特性，通过压缩-重建-减法范式直接建模结构感知的低秩背景表示，无需依赖基于块的处理或显式矩阵分解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测在复杂背景下因低信噪比、目标形态多样和缺乏视觉线索而具有挑战性，现有深度学习方法因目标内在变异性导致性能不稳定。

Method: 采用压缩-重建-减法（CRS）范式，直接学习图像域中的低秩背景结构，通过端到端深度神经网络实现。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，LRRNet在检测精度、鲁棒性和计算效率上优于38种先进方法，实时性能达82.34 FPS，且在噪声环境下表现优异。

Conclusion: LRRNet首次通过端到端深度网络直接学习低秩背景结构，显著提升了红外小目标检测的性能和效率。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in
complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target
morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep
learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic
variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework,
termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image
backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our
approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to
directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image
domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly
learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets
demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it
achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations
on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to
sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频内容的快速增长需要有效的视频摘要技术，传统单模态方法难以捕捉视频的完整语义。

Method: MF2Summ采用五阶段流程：特征提取、跨模态注意力交互、特征融合、片段预测和关键镜头选择，结合视觉和听觉特征。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum数据集上，MF2Summ的F1分数分别比DSNet模型提高了1.9%和0.6%，优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: MF2Summ通过多模态融合和跨模态交互，显著提升了视频摘要的性能。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video
summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single
modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of
videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based
on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory
information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction,
cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key
shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet
model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our
fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided
self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal
dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and
center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm.
Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ
achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and
0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>

Motivation: 多模态情感识别面临模态缺失和分布外数据的双重挑战，现有方法实用性有限。

Method: CIDer包含自蒸馏模块（MSSD）和因果推理模块（MACI），分别增强鲁棒性和解决分布外问题。

Result: CIDer在RMFM和OOD任务中表现优异，参数少且训练速度快。

Conclusion: CIDer为多模态情感识别提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统显式运动方法在人体视频压缩中因复杂多样的运动模式导致重建失真和运动不准确，需要改进。

Method: 提出隐式运动变换（IMT），将复杂人体信号转化为紧凑视觉特征，并生成隐式运动指导以重建信号。

Result: 实验证明IMT能高效压缩并实现高保真合成。

Conclusion: IMT为生成式人体视频编码提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了压缩和重建质量。

Abstract: Beyond traditional hybrid-based video codec, generative video codec could
achieve promising compression performance by evolving high-dimensional signals
into compact feature representations for bitstream compactness at the encoder
side and developing explicit motion fields as intermediate supervision for
high-quality reconstruction at the decoder side. This paradigm has achieved
significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial
videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and
diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for
Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer
severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the
limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video
compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of
Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to
characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and
transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency
compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过分块处理和特征距离损失增强对抗样本的迁移性，用于高光谱图像分类模型的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）因其高维和丰富的光谱信息与自然图像不同，现有对抗攻击方法未能充分利用其结构特征，研究有限。

Method: 1. 将图像分块处理，保持结构不变；2. 设计特征距离损失，以中间层特征距离为主损失，输出层预测为辅助损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的对抗样本在公开数据集上对黑盒模型具有高效迁移性，且在防御策略下仍保持攻击性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了对抗样本的迁移性，为高光谱图像分类模型的安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies
based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based
adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural
images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current
research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in
fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability
of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping
the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image
into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various
transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input
diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting
intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the
amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial
examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the
auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the
true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by
the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on
two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack
performance even under defense strategies.

Motivation: 量化是降低机器学习模型推理成本的重要工具，但权重初始化对量化鲁棒性的影响尚未被充分研究。

Method: 通过分析不同权重初始化方法对CNN量化鲁棒性的影响，并提出了GHN-QAT方法，利用图超网络预测量化DNN的参数。

Result: GHN-QAT显著提升了4位量化的准确性，并在2位量化中表现优于随机初始化。

Conclusion: GHN-QAT为量化DNN模型设计提供了新思路，未来可结合量化感知训练进一步优化量化过程。

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing
models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack
the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions.
While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to
generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic
medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning
segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on
complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose
MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of
MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing
corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two
core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets
images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal
intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these
tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses.
Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the
medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask
pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large
language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show
MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high

Motivation: 深度伪造技术日益复杂，威胁媒体完整性和公众信任，而视觉语言模型（VLMs）因其多领域潜力被探索用于检测深度伪造。

Method: 研究对ChatGPT、Claude、Gemini和Grok四种VLMs进行了结构化零样本评估，使用包含真实和伪造图像的基准数据集，评估分类准确性和推理深度。

Result: VLMs能检测表面异常并提供解释，但依赖度不足，易受误导性视觉模式影响；其优势在于可解释性和上下文分析能力。

Conclusion: 通用VLMs目前无法独立可靠检测深度伪造，但在混合或人机协作框架中具有潜力。

Abstract: The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to
the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently,
vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual
reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains,
sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study
conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT,
Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap,
reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled
benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we
evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis
indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect
surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection
systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on
stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage
aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and
contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in
forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models
currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they
hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection
frameworks.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six

Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,
we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored
explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used
Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis
that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,
accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score
provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蜂蜜的植物源分类对市场价值至关重要，但难以一次性收集所有品种进行模型训练，因此需要类增量学习技术。

Method: 研究比较了多种CIL算法，并提出结合CB算法的方法，通过重新初始化较少使用的隐藏神经元来提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，CB方法将大多数CIL算法的性能提高了1-7%。

Conclusion: CB算法有效解决了类增量学习中的塑性损失问题，提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of
different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits,
thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective
botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'
interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey
products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.
Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to
address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL
algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel
technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental
learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)
algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by
reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability
into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of
most CIL methods by 1-7\%.

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture,
specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images.
Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature
extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale
Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction
of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After
detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto
corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects
across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection
process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and
complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain,
we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on
aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated
aircraft inspection technologies.

Conclusion: CogStream任务和CogReasoner模型为流媒体视频推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species
occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured
templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and
a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project,
showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended
ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in
human-understandable language.

Result: CEI能有效检测现有方法难以发现的细微偏差，并提出了自动化版本CEI^A。

Conclusion: CEI为FR公平性评估提供了鲁棒且敏感的工具，适用于任何关注分布尾部比较的问题。

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

Dense visual SLAM, leveraging RGB-D camera systems, offers advantages but faces
challenges in achieving real-time performance, robustness, and scalability for
large-scale scenes. Recent approaches utilizing neural implicit scene
representations show promise but suffer from high computational costs and

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

Conclusion: PLACE框架显著提升了医学视觉表征学习的效果，具有广泛适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint
learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to
alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary
challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse
relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused
on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the
importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel
framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the
fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human
annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal
alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations
from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology
Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation
representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently
of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and
robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces
the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the
fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification,
image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report
generation.

Motivation: 音乐到舞蹈生成存在语义鸿沟和一对多映射问题，且缺乏配对的音乐舞蹈数据，限制了模型的多样性学习能力。

Method: DanceChat包含三个模块：LLM生成伪指令、多模态特征提取与融合、基于扩散的运动合成与多模态对齐损失。

Result: 在AIST++数据集和人工评估中，DanceChat在质量和数量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DanceChat通过LLM的显式指导，显著提升了音乐到舞蹈生成的效果，解决了多样性和对齐问题。

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned
on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to
the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract
cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the
physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple
plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional
guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse
dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired
music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn
diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language
Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a
choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,
high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit
learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both
more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of
three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that
produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a
multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,
and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based
motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which
ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.
Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CLIP模型中文本与图像模态差异问题，提升仅用文本进行参数高效微调时的图像识别性能。

Method: 利用文本生成图像模型生成多样化图像，结合类热图和可学习原型，同时采用提示调优和适配器学习。

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均性能提升3.47%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: T2I-PAL无需全语义标注，减少人工工作量，且兼容现有CLIP框架。

Abstract: Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language
models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image
features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap
remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.
Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel
method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text
captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained
text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images
from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,
T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This
aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual
features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better
PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance
classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it
eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby
reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of
the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP
framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance
by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: HyperSphereDiff通过结合角度不确定性，更好地保留了超球面流形的内在几何结构。

Abstract: Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of
hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise
in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many
real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical
manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry
within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties
are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this
limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures
with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing
angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of
hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative
models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face
datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the
underlying hyperspherical manifold. Resources are available at:

Conclusion: 非对称随机掩码策略在自蒸馏框架中有效，能够平衡训练效率和语义信息保留。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as
DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks,
random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce
regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that
indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic
information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In
this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation
setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking
exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local
views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This
design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean
supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our
approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random
masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained
attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.

Conclusion: HEA-MM框架为航空制造提供了一种高效的误差评估工具，提升了质量控制能力。

Abstract: The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including
high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models
within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs
structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of
manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the
reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three
hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error
analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the
reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these
patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based
primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point
clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine
the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on
circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a
two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,
edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple
circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring
accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results
on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Abstract: Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented
object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation
for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision
offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing,
yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance
confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP
(Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes
rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically,
SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based
Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of
object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples
through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based
Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by
semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form

*Eshan Ramesh,Nishio Takayuki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LatentCSI利用预训练的潜在扩散模型（LDM）从WiFi CSI测量生成物理环境图像，避免了传统方法的复杂计算，并通过文本引导实现高效高质量的图像合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖复杂且计算密集的技术（如GANs），LatentCSI旨在通过轻量级神经网络和LDM简化流程，提升效率和图像质量。

Method: 使用轻量级神经网络将CSI振幅直接映射到LDM的潜在空间，结合文本引导的扩散模型和预训练解码器生成高分辨率图像。

Result: 在公开数据集和自采数据集上验证，LatentCSI在计算效率和感知质量上优于基线方法，并具备文本引导的可控性。

Conclusion: LatentCSI提供了一种高效、高质量的图像生成方法，特别适用于WiFi CSI到图像的转换任务。

Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical
environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent
diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and
computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a
lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space
of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent
representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's
pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the
challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image
encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines,
enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach
on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi
devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The
results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable
complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational
efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical
advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

TL;DR: MSTAR提出了一种无需边界框标注的场景文本检索方法，通过动态捕捉多粒度文本表示和协调自由文本查询，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要昂贵的边界框标注且难以统一多种查询类型，MSTAR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用渐进式视觉嵌入动态捕捉文本多粒度表示，结合风格感知指令协调查询，并集成多实例匹配模块增强视觉-语言对齐。

Result: 在七个公共数据集和MQTR数据集上表现优越，MAP提升6.4%，在MQTR上平均提升8.5%。

Conclusion: MSTAR在无需边界框标注的情况下显著提升了多查询场景文本检索性能。

Abstract: Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of
accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require
costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a
customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to
meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query
Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for
scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to
dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes
free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a
multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset,
the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval
capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public
datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box
annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly
outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets

Motivation: 现有文本到纹理合成方法因扩散过程中纹理信息整合不足和预定义相机位置选择不当，导致纹理一致性差。

Conclusion: TexTailor通过改进纹理合成和视角选择，显著提升了纹理一致性，为文本到纹理合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像的潜在扩散模型在医学影像领域表现不佳，主要由于数据稀缺和临床信息对齐不足。

Result: 在MS-CXR数据集上达到新最优性能，并在VinDr-CXR数据上表现稳健。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了医学影像中文本与图像的对齐能力，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models have shown remarkable results in text-guided image
synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works
have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language
downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary,
text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the
field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due
to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we
first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has
not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology
reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this
issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a
pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream
tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a
standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance
on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: SymmFlow是一种对称流匹配框架，统一了语义分割、分类和图像生成，通过双向一致性学习目标实现高效采样和语义保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像生成、语义分割和分类任务中通常独立建模，缺乏统一的框架。SymmFlow旨在通过对称学习目标实现多任务统一建模。

Method: 提出对称学习目标，联合建模正向和反向变换，保留生成多样性；引入新训练目标显式保留语义信息，支持一步分割和分类。

Result: 在CelebAMask-HQ和COCO-Stuff上分别取得FID 11.9和7.0的SOTA性能，同时在分割和分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SymmFlow为多任务生成模型提供了高效统一的解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型的微调方法依赖人工标注和大规模计算资源，限制了实用性。

Method: 设计了基于提示的数据引擎和奖励引导的训练策略，利用预训练视觉语言模型自动优化。

Result: 在VBench-2.0基准测试中，平均性能提升约4%，仅需4 GPU小时。

Conclusion: GigaVideo-1在无需人工标注和少量真实数据的情况下，实现了高效且有效的视频生成优化。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation
quality, yet these models still require fine-tuning to improve specific
dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and
physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human
annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their
practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning
framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision.
Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources,
GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models
through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the
fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we
design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented
training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided
training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from
pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate
GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17
evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves
performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using
only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data,
GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and
data will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有原型方法在医学图像中学习的原型过于细粒度，且可视化结果与人类可理解的生物标志物不一致，限制了其临床应用。

Method: PiPViT利用视觉Transformer捕获长距离依赖关系，结合对比学习和多分辨率输入处理，学习具有临床意义的原型。

Result: 在视网膜OCT图像分类任务中，PiPViT性能与先进方法相当，同时提供更具临床意义的解释。

Conclusion: PiPViT能透明解释其决策，帮助临床医生理解诊断结果。

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

Result: 在Style GAN数据集上分类准确率94.14%，AUC-ROC得分0.985。

Conclusion: 该方法为Deepfake检测提供了高效、低资源消耗的解决方案。

Abstract: In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced
artificial intelligence to create highly convincing manipulated content,
undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated
fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism.
To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning
methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most
of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage
and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution
neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for
Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic
channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to
emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a
more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a
simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in
size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake
detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of
94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse
Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for
combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources,
developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.

Motivation: 传统CAPTCHA方案在深度学习攻击下易受攻击，现有对抗攻击方法依赖原始图像特征，导致失真且适用性受限。

Method: UAC利用大型语言模型生成对抗样本，EDICT方法优化扩散模型的双潜在变量以提升图像质量；BP-UAC采用双路径优化策略，结合多模态梯度和双路径优化实现高效误分类。

Result: 实验表明BP-UAC在多种系统中攻击成功率高，生成的CAPTCHA对人类和DNN均难以区分。

Conclusion: UAC框架有效解决了传统CAPTCHA的脆弱性问题，为对抗攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

Result: 模型在ASORES-39k测试集上降低了RMSE，提升了F2分数；在ASWIFT-20k测试集上保持了高召回率，显著提升了F2分数。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在未成年人筛查任务中表现出色，尤其在数据分布偏移下具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models
that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children
under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we
propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination
tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact
two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four
binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing
on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we
introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch
sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization.
Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from
the loss.
  Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age
Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining
both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest
domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images,
stressing extreme pose ($>$45{\deg}), expression, and low image quality to
emulate real-world shifts.
  Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage
model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test
from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from
F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to
the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall
while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline,
demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12
and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and
from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.

Result: 在EgoObjects数据集上验证，HyperCLIC在多粒度任务中表现优异，提升了分层泛化能力。

Conclusion: HyperCLIC有效解决了实例和类别的分层持续学习问题，适用于动态现实场景。

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

Result: 在多个COD基准测试中，平均MAE提升5.5%，加权F-measure提升3.2%，计算开销较小。

Conclusion: UMBD框架能够有效提升COD性能，且易于与现有模型集成。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the
subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing
methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for
post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this
limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model,
the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD
introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies
Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality,
enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To
support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network
(HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from
multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance
during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be
seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD
models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative
advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple
COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest
computational overhead. Code will be released.

Conclusion: 该方法在表面缺陷检测中具有实际应用价值，通过模板匹配展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

Result: 在六个医学数据集上，IQE-CLIP在零样本和少样本设置中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: IQE-CLIP有效解决了医学领域异常检测的挑战，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly
improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks.
However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories
and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While
these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they
often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding
space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with
limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query
embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve
as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce
class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical
setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts
region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the
generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six
medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are

TL;DR: PosterCraft是一个统一的框架，用于生成高质量的海报，通过多阶段优化流程实现文本渲染和艺术内容的无缝融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成美观的海报比简单的设计图像更具挑战性，需要精确的文本渲染和艺术内容的和谐融合。

Method: PosterCraft采用级联工作流程，包括文本渲染优化、区域感知微调、美学文本强化学习和联合视觉语言反馈细化。

Result: PosterCraft在渲染准确性、布局连贯性和视觉吸引力方面显著优于开源基线，接近商业系统的水平。

Conclusion: PosterCraft通过自动化数据构建和多阶段优化，成功实现了高质量海报的生成。

Abstract: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images:
it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration
of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony.
To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons
prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to
freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs
a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of
high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our
newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised
fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via
best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback
refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction
pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without
complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments,
PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering
accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality
of SOTA commercial systems. Our code, models, and datasets can be found in the

*Wenhao Guo,Peng Lu,Xujun Peng,Zhaoran Zhao,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于笔划的循环放大器（SbCA）模型，用于解决超大规模图像超分辨率任务中的性能下降问题，通过分解图像为矢量图形并循环优化细节，显著提升了图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任意尺度图像超分辨率方法在超出训练数据范围的放大因子下性能显著下降，导致模糊问题，需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出SbCA模型，通过笔划矢量放大器将图像分解为矢量图形进行放大，结合细节补全模块恢复缺失细节，并通过循环策略迭代优化。

Result: 实验表明，SbCA在超大规模放大任务（如×100）中显著优于现有方法，消除了伪影、噪声和模糊，生成高质量图像。

Conclusion: SbCA模型通过统一训练和循环优化，有效解决了分布漂移问题，为超大规模图像超分辨率提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

TL;DR: SlotPi是一个基于物理知识的对象中心推理模型，通过整合哈密顿原理和时空预测模块，解决了现有方法在物理知识集成和模型适应性验证上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过观察世界获取物理知识并应用于动态场景推理，而现有方法忽视了物理知识的集成和模型在多样化场景中的适应性验证。

Method: SlotPi结合了基于哈密顿原理的物理模块和时空预测模块，用于动态预测。

Result: 实验表明，SlotPi在基准和流体数据集上的预测和视觉问答任务中表现优异，并在真实世界数据集上验证了其适应性。

Conclusion: SlotPi的强适应性为开发更先进的世界模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

Motivation: 传统基于图像的控制器存在固定速率、运动模糊和延迟问题，而事件相机的异步特性可以灵活处理视觉信息，实现自适应推理和控制。

Method: 框架整合了基于事件的感知、额外距离传感和通过深度确定性策略梯度优化的策略，并采用初始模仿学习提高样本效率。

Result: 在模拟环境中取得了良好效果，展示了鲁棒的导航、行人跟随和避障能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过事件相机和强化学习的结合，为机器人导航提供了高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: This work introduces a robot navigation controller that combines event
cameras and other sensors with reinforcement learning to enable real-time
human-centered navigation and obstacle avoidance. Unlike conventional
image-based controllers, which operate at fixed rates and suffer from motion
blur and latency, this approach leverages the asynchronous nature of event
cameras to process visual information over flexible time intervals, enabling
adaptive inference and control. The framework integrates event-based
perception, additional range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient, with an initial imitation learning phase to
improve sample efficiency. Promising results are achieved in simulated
environments, demonstrating robust navigation, pedestrian following, and
obstacle avoidance. A demo video is available at the project website.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频数据的爆炸性增长需要灵活的用户可控摘要工具，而现有方法要么依赖数据集限制了泛化能力，要么无法结合用户自然语言表达的意图。

Method: 方法包括视频分段、场景级描述生成、利用大型语言模型评分，并通过一致性和独特性指标传播分数生成细粒度帧重要性。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum数据集上超越了所有无监督方法，并在QFVS基准上表现优异，无需训练数据。

Conclusion: 研究表明，预训练多模态模型结合提示和分数传播，为通用文本查询视频摘要提供了强大基础。

Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible
user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific
training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting
generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural
language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot,
text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language
models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models
(LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all
unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw
video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level
descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme
that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a
judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt,
and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new
metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding
fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach
surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs
competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark,
despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised
frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a
new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step
reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first
challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained
multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score
propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal,
text-queryable video summarization.

TL;DR: SmoothProper是一种即插即用的神经模块，通过引入平滑性和消息传递机制，解决了基于学习的可变形图像注册（DIR）在稀疏特征和大位移场景中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无监督DIR方法在稀疏特征和大位移场景中表现不佳，因为神经网络预测的变形场在训练后不受约束，且正则化负担完全由网络权重承担。

Method: SmoothProper通过集成基于对偶优化的层和定制交互项，在网络前向传播中强制平滑性和结构一致性，无需额外参数调整。

Result: 在视网膜血管数据集上，SmoothPrope将注册误差降至1.88像素（2912x2912图像），首次有效解决了稀疏特征和大位移问题。

Conclusion: SmoothPrope是一种模型无关、高效的解决方案，可无缝集成到现有DIR框架中，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在遮挡情况下表现不佳，主要因为缺乏全局结构感知和推理能力。

Method: 提出目标聚焦掩码策略，结合多尺度特征和SDF与点云融合，增强遮挡处理能力。

Result: 在DexYCB和HO3Dv2基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: HOMAE通过结合全局上下文和局部几何信息，有效解决了遮挡问题。

Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant
challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object
interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural
perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded
hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an
occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked
autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused
masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object
interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason
about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features
extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing
both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception,
we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF,
leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion
enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global
context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point
cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks
demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object
pose estimation. We will release our code and model.

Motivation: 长视频理解（LVU）任务因其复杂性和上下文窗口限制，通常被认为需要具备扩展上下文窗口、强视觉感知能力和领域专业知识的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）。本文挑战了这一假设，提出了一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: VideoDeepResearch框架仅依赖文本推理模型（LRM）和模块化多模态工具包（包括多模态检索器和视觉感知器），通过问题解决策略和选择性视频内容访问完成任务。

Result: 在MLVU、Video-MME和LVBench等基准测试中，VideoDeepResearch分别比现有MLLM基线提升了9.6%、6.6%和3.9%，显著优于之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，代理系统在解决长视频理解任务中具有巨大潜力，无需依赖复杂的多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

Motivation: 视频抠图在资源受限设备上部署时面临计算密集型模型的挑战，现有PTQ方法在精度和时序一致性上存在不足，亟需一种高效解决方案。

Method: 提出两阶段PTQ策略（块重建优化和全局参数校准）、统计驱动的全局仿射校准（GAC）方法，以及光流辅助（OFA）组件。

Result: PTQ4VM在不同位宽下均达到最先进精度，4位量化下性能接近全精度模型，计算量减少8倍。

Conclusion: 该框架为视频抠图量化提供了系统解决方案，显著提升了量化模型的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

Result: CreatiPoster在自动化指标上超越领先的开源和商业系统，并发布了10万份无版权多层设计数据集。

Conclusion: CreatiPoster推动了AI辅助图形设计的民主化，支持多种应用场景。

Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts,
yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic
compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for
beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to
accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve
professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely
on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,
we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer
compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol
model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification
detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content
and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model
then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground
layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design
generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches
and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a
copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports
diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing,
multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of
AI-assisted graphic design. Project homepage:

Motivation: 现有ZSGM方法假设文本偏移与图像偏移在CLIP嵌入空间中完全对齐，导致生成图像质量下降。本文旨在分析这种不对齐现象并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过实证研究分析CLIP嵌入空间中文本与图像偏移的不对齐现象，并提出Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)方法，迭代优化生成图像质量。

Result: 在26种实验设置中，AIR方法在定性、定量和用户研究中均表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AIR方法通过解决偏移不对齐问题，显著提升了零样本生成模型在目标域中的图像生成质量。

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

Method: 提出多模态扩散Mamba块（MM-DiM），通过多模态令牌重组设计整合多模态信息和时空建模；引入奖励学习策略提升长上下文生成中的视觉质量。

Result: M4V在768×1280分辨率视频生成中，相比基于注意力的方法减少45%的FLOPs，并在实验中表现出高质量视频生成能力。

Conclusion: M4V通过高效的多模态Mamba框架和奖励学习策略，显著降低了计算成本并提升了视频质量，为文本到视频生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于频谱视角的自回归视觉生成框架SpectralAR，通过将图像转换为有序频谱令牌实现因果性，并在ImageNet-1K上验证了其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将视觉序列构建为空间块进行自回归生成，但图像块本质上是并行的，与自回归建模的因果性矛盾。

Method: 使用嵌套频谱令牌化将图像转换为有序频谱令牌，从低频到高频进行自回归生成。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，SpectralAR仅用64个令牌和310M参数实现了3.02 gFID。

Conclusion: SpectralAR通过频谱视角实现了视觉序列的因果性和高效性，无需额外复杂设计。

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图像对人类文明和学习至关重要，但生成此类图像需要多模态推理能力，现有模型表现不足。

Method: 提出MMMG基准，包含4,456个专家验证的图像-提示对，采用统一知识图谱表示，并设计MMMG-Score评估生成图像。

Result: 评估16个先进文本到图像生成模型，发现推理能力不足，GPT-4o得分仅50.20。

Conclusion: MMMG基准揭示了图像生成模型的推理缺陷，并发布FLUX-Reason作为改进基线。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉令牌修剪方法存在冗余或忽略指令相关性的问题，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出CDPruner，利用条件相似性和DPP最大化保留令牌的条件多样性。

Result: 在多种MLLMs上表现优异，显著降低计算成本（如LLaVA上FLOPs减少95%），同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: CDPruner是一种高效、通用的视觉令牌修剪方法，显著提升MLLMs的推理效率。

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

Conclusion: GenWorld和SpannDetector推动了AI生成视频检测领域的发展。

Abstract: The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，QuadricFormer在性能和效率上均达到最优。

Conclusion: 超二次曲面基元能够高效表示复杂结构，QuadricFormer在3D占用预测中表现出色且高效。

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as
it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics.
Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring
the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works
explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their
ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In
real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids,
cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians
densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient
representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive
superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex
structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We
develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each
superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding
geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture.
Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for
efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module
to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in
occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining
superior efficiency.

Conclusion: 首次对扩散模型中的注意力扰动进行了头级别分析，揭示了注意力层内的可解释性专业化，并为设计有效扰动策略提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现优异，速度提升1000倍，并支持灵活的下游应用。

Conclusion: InstaInpaint在速度和性能上均优于现有方法，适用于实时3D场景修复。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in
virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better
immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods
are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current
approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making
them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint,
a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from
a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised
masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large
reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive
experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve
generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint
achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a
state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show
that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as
object insertion and multi-region inpainting. More video results are available

Result: 该方法在多样数据集上展示了生成新视角合成的优越一致性和合理性。

Conclusion: SceneCompleter通过融合结构和纹理信息，实现了视觉连贯且3D一致的生成场景补全。

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis
(NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However,
existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative
models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques
to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and
distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely
from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that
achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene
completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent
generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a
geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel
views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene
understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and
textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and
plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents a powerful automated framework for making complex systems

interdependent software components across heterogeneous hardware components
with widely varying capabilities. A configuration specifies how software is
distributed and replicated: which software components to run on each computer,
which software components to replicate, which replication protocols to use,
etc. We present an algorithm that, given a system model and resilience
requirements, (1) determines initial configurations of the system that are
resilient, and (2) generates a reconfiguration policy that determines
reconfiguration actions to execute in response to failures and recoveries. This
model-finding algorithm is based on state-space exploration and incorporates
powerful optimizations, including a quotient reduction based on a novel
equivalence relation between states. We present experimental results from
successfully applying a prototype implementation of our framework to a model of

Conclusion: 该研究为高性能代码转译提供了新思路，展示了LLM在解决CUDA生态系统兼容性挑战中的重要作用。

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model
parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software
ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly
alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of
user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem
has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This
dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with
performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms
poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming
paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language
extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations
in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur
substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary
potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks.
However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly
for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this
limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA
and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic
optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based
data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating
LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU
transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our
framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential
of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, optimizing both
energy efficiency and model accuracy remains a challenge, given device and data
heterogeneity. Further, sustainable AI through a global energy budget for FL
has not been explored. We propose a novel optimization problem for client
selection in FL that maximizes the model accuracy within an overall energy
limit and reduces training time. We solve this with a unique bi-level ILP
formulation that leverages approximate Shapley values and energy-time
prediction models to efficiently solve this. Our FedJoule framework achieves
superior training accuracies compared to SOTA and simple baselines for diverse
energy budgets, non-IID distributions, and realistic experiment configurations,
performing 15% and 48% better on accuracy and time, respectively. The results
highlight the effectiveness of our method in achieving a viable trade-off
between energy usage and performance in FL environments.

Abstract: Edge Computing emerges as a promising alternative of Cloud Computing, with
scalable compute resources and services deployed in the path between IoT
devices and Cloud. Since virtualization techniques can be applied on Edge
compute nodes, administrators can share their Edge infrastructures among
multiple users, providing the so-called multi-tenancy. Even though
multi-tenancy is unavoidable, it raises concerns about security and performance
degradation due to resource contention in Edge Computing. For that,
administrators need to deploy services with non-antagonizing profiles and
explore workload co-location scenarios to enhance performance and energy
consumption. Achieving this, however, requires extensive configuration,
deployment, iterative testing, and analysis, an effort-intensive and
time-consuming process. To address this challenge, we introduce an
auto-benchmarking framework designed to streamline the analysis of
multi-tenancy performance in Edge environments. Our framework includes a
built-in monitoring stack and integrates with widely used benchmarking
workloads, such as streaming analytics, database operations, machine learning
applications, and component-based stress testing. We perform a case-driven
analysis and provide valuable insights into the impact of multi-tenancy on Edge
environments with different hardware configurations and diverse workloads.
Finally, the implementation of our framework, along with the containerized
workloads used for experimentation, is publicly available.

Abstract: As the model size continuously increases, pipeline parallelism shows great
promise in throughput-oriented LLM inference due to its low demand on
communications. However, imbalanced pipeline workloads and complex data
dependencies in the prefill and decode phases result in massive pipeline
bubbles and further severe performance reduction. To better exploit the
pipeline parallelism for high-throughput LLM inference, we propose TD-Pipe,
with the key idea lies in the temporally-disaggregated pipeline parallelism
architecture. Specifically, this architecture disaggregates the prefill and
decode phases in the temporal dimension, so as to eliminate pipeline bubbles
caused by the phase switching. TD-Pipe identifies potential issues of
exploiting the novel architecture and provides solutions. First, a
hierarchy-controller structure is used to better coordinate devices in pipeline
parallelism by decoupling the scheduling from execution. Second, the AI-based
greedy prefill approach aggressively performs more prefills by predicting the
output length and simulating the memory usage. Third, the inter-batch work
stealing approach dynamically balances decode phase workloads between different
batches to reduce bubbles. Forth, the spatial-temporal intensity comparison
approach determines the optimal switch from decode to prefill by comparing the
performance drop from reduced computational intensity with that from phase
switching bubbles. Extensive experiments show that TD-Pipe effectively
increases the throughput of LLM inference by up to 1.91x over the existing
tensor parallel approach and 2.73x over the existing pipeline parallel approach
on GPU nodes with only PCIe interconnection.

TL;DR: HP2C-DT架构通过集成高性能计算（HPC）到计算连续体中，解决了数字孪生中实时响应与计算需求平衡的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统云方案存在延迟和资源限制，而边缘计算缺乏复杂模拟能力，需要一种新架构来结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出HP2C-DT参考架构，动态分配任务至边缘、云或HPC资源，并实现HP2C-DT框架，使用COMPSs进行工作负载分布。

Result: 在电网用例中测试，带宽减少一个数量级，响应时间提升2倍，计算密集型工作流实现近乎理想的强扩展性。

Conclusion: HPC驱动的数字孪生方法能突破现有局限，使其更智能、快速且适应现实复杂性。

Abstract: Digital twins are transforming the way we monitor, analyze, and control
physical systems, but designing architectures that balance real-time
responsiveness with heavy computational demands remains a challenge.
Cloud-based solutions often struggle with latency and resource constraints,
while edge-based approaches lack the processing power for complex simulations
and data-driven optimizations.
  To address this problem, we propose the High-Precision High-Performance
Computer-enabled Digital Twin (HP2C-DT) reference architecture, which
integrates High-Performance Computing (HPC) into the computing continuum.
Unlike traditional setups that use HPC only for offline simulations, HP2C-DT
makes it an active part of digital twin workflows, dynamically assigning tasks
to edge, cloud, or HPC resources based on urgency and computational needs.
  Furthermore, to bridge the gap between theory and practice, we introduce the
HP2C-DT framework, a working implementation that uses COMPSs for seamless
workload distribution across diverse infrastructures. We test it in a power
grid use case, showing how it reduces communication bandwidth by an order of
magnitude through edge-side data aggregation, improves response times by up to
2x via dynamic offloading, and maintains near-ideal strong scaling for
compute-intensive workflows across a practical range of resources. These
results demonstrate how an HPC-driven approach can push digital twins beyond
their current limitations, making them smarter, faster, and more capable of
handling real-world complexity.

Abstract: Quantum computing holds great potential to accelerate the process of solving
complex combinatorial optimization problems. The Distributed Quantum
Approximate Optimization Algorithm (DQAOA) addresses high-dimensional, dense

Abstract: The convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things
has accelerated the development of distributed, network-sensitive applications,
necessitating ultra-low latency, high throughput, and real-time processing
capabilities. While 5G networks represent a significant technological
milestone, their ability to support AI-driven edge applications remains
constrained by performance gaps observed in real-world deployments. This paper
addresses these limitations and highlights critical advancements needed to
realize a robust and scalable 6G ecosystem optimized for AI applications.
Furthermore, we conduct an empirical evaluation of 5G network infrastructure in
central Europe, with latency measurements ranging from 61 ms to 110 ms across
different close geographical areas. These values exceed the requirements of
latency-critical AI applications by approximately 270%, revealing significant
shortcomings in current deployments. Building on these findings, we propose a
set of recommendations to bridge the gap between existing 5G performance and
the requirements of next-generation AI applications.

Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a privacy-preserving technique for
collaborative model training across heterogeneously distributed silos. Yet, its
reliance on a single central server introduces potential bottlenecks and risks
of single-point failure. Decentralizing the server, often referred to as
decentralized learning, addresses this problem by distributing the server role
across nodes within the network. One drawback regarding this pure
decentralization is it introduces communication inefficiencies, which arise
from increased message exchanges in large-scale setups. However, existing
proposed solutions often fail to simulate the real-world distributed and
decentralized environment in their experiments, leading to unreliable
performance evaluations and limited applicability in practice. Recognizing the
lack from prior works, this work investigates the correlation between model
size and network latency, a critical factor in optimizing decentralized
learning communication. We propose a graph-based gossiping mechanism, where
specifically, minimum spanning tree and graph coloring are used to optimize
network structure and scheduling for efficient communication across various
network topologies and message capacities. Our approach configures and manages
subnetworks on real physical routers and devices and closely models real-world
distributed setups. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves communication, compatible with different topologies and
data sizes, reducing bandwidth and transfer time by up to circa 8 and 4.4
times, respectively, compared to naive flooding broadcasting methods.

Abstract: Energy consumption in current large scale computing infrastructures is
becoming a critical issue, especially with the growing demand for centralized
systems such as cloud environments. With the advancement of microservice
architectures and the Internet of Things, messaging systems have become an
integral and mainstream part of modern computing infrastructures, carrying out

as well as required components, and setup scenarios, involving different
workloads and configurations among the tests as well as messaging system use
cases. Alternative architectures are investigated and compared from an energy
consumption point of view, for different message rates and consumer numbers.
Differences in architectural selection have been quantified and can lead to up
to 31\% reduction in power consumption. The resulting dataset is made publicly

TL;DR: 论文研究了扩展的红蓝鹅卵石游戏（PRBP），允许部分计算步骤，显著降低I/O成本，并探讨了其理论性质和实际应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统红蓝鹅卵石游戏（RBP）要求操作的所有输入同时存在于快速内存中，而实际计算中，输入可以逐步聚合。PRBP提供了更现实的成本模型。

Method: 通过定义PRBP模型，分析其性质，并与RBP对比。使用简单例子展示部分计算如何降低I/O成本，并讨论S-分区的适应性。

Result: 部分计算可线性降低I/O成本，但具体DAG中是否可行是NP难问题。PRBP的I/O成本下界和近似难度仍保持NP难。

Conclusion: PRBP为实际计算提供了更优的成本模型，但其优化问题仍具挑战性。

Abstract: We study an extension of the well-known red-blue pebble game (RBP) with
partial computation steps, inspired by the recent work of Sobczyk. While the
original RBP assumes that we need to have all the inputs of an operation in
fast memory at the same time, in many concrete computations, the inputs can be
aggregated one by one into the final output value. These partial computation
steps can enable pebbling strategies with much smaller I/O cost, and in
settings where such a step-by-step aggregation is possible, this extended
red-blue pebble game offers a much more realistic cost model.
  We establish the fundamental properties of this partial-computing red-blue
pebble game (PRBP), and compare it to the original RBP. We begin with some
simple examples where allowing partial computations can decrease the optimal
I/O cost. It is also shown that the cost can decrease by up to a linear factor
this way, but in general, it is NP-hard to decide whether partial computations
allow for a smaller cost in a specific DAG. We then discuss how $S$-partitions,
a crucial tool for deriving I/O lower bounds in RBP, can be adapted to the PRBP
model. These new tools are then used to establish lower bounds on the I/O cost
of some prominent computational tasks. Finally, we also adapt a hardness result
from RBP, showing that the optimum cost is still NP-hard to approximate in PRBP
to any reasonable factor.

Conclusion: 通过模拟工具和优化调度策略，可以有效提升分布式量子系统的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Present-day quantum systems face critical bottlenecks, including limited
qubit counts, brief coherence intervals, and high susceptibility to errors-all
of which obstruct the execution of large and complex circuits. The advancement
of quantum algorithms has outpaced the capabilities of existing quantum
hardware, making it difficult to scale computations effectively. Additionally,
inconsistencies in hardware performance and pervasive quantum noise undermine
system stability and computational accuracy. To optimize quantum workloads
under these constraints, strategic approaches to task scheduling and resource
coordination are essential. These methods must aim to accelerate processing,
retain operational fidelity, and reduce the communication burden inherent to
distributed setups. One of the persistent challenges in this domain is how to
efficiently divide and execute large circuits across multiple quantum
processors (QPUs), especially in error-prone environments. In response, we
introduce a simulation-based tool that supports distributed scheduling and
concurrent execution of quantum jobs on networked QPUs connected via real-time
classical channels. The tool models circuit decomposition for workloads that
surpass individual QPU limits, allowing for parallel execution through
inter-processor communication. Using this simulation environment, we compare
four distinct scheduling techniques-among them, a model informed by
reinforcement learning. These strategies are evaluated across multiple metrics,
including runtime efficiency, fidelity preservation, and communication costs.
Our analysis underscores the trade-offs inherent in each approach and
highlights how parallelized, noise-aware scheduling can meaningfully improve
computational throughput in distributed quantum infrastructures.

Abstract: Over the years, the chip industry has consistently developed high-performance
processors to address the increasing demands across diverse applications.
However, the rapid expansion of chip production has significantly increased
carbon emissions, raising critical concerns about environmental sustainability.
While researchers have previously modeled the carbon footprint (CFP) at both
system and processor levels, a holistic analysis of sustainability trends
encompassing the entire chip lifecycle remains lacking. This paper presents
CarbonSet, a comprehensive dataset integrating sustainability and performance
metrics for CPUs and GPUs over the past decade. CarbonSet aims to benchmark and
assess the design of next-generation processors. Leveraging this dataset, we
conducted detailed analysis of flagship processors' sustainability trends over
the last decade. This paper further highlights that modern processors are not
yet sustainably designed, with total carbon emissions increasing more than
50$\times$ in the past three years due to the surging demand driven by the AI
boom. Power efficiency remains a significant concern, while advanced process
nodes pose new challenges requiring to effectively amortize the dramatically

TL;DR: EasyDRAM是一个基于FPGA的框架，旨在快速、准确地评估DRAM技术，解决了现有平台对硬件描述语言的高要求和现代系统建模不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FPGA平台在评估DRAM技术时存在两大问题：需要硬件描述语言的专业知识，以及难以准确建模现代计算系统。

Method: EasyDRAM通过允许开发者使用高级语言（C++）实现DRAM技术，并通过时间缩放技术解耦处理器-DRAM接口，准确建模系统时序行为。

Result: EasyDRAM成功克服了现有平台的局限性，为内存系统设计提供了快速评估工具。

Conclusion: EasyDRAM有望推动内存系统设计的创新，其开源实现为未来研究提供了支持。

Abstract: DRAM is a critical component of modern computing systems. Recent works
propose numerous techniques (that we call DRAM techniques) to enhance
DRAM-based computing systems' throughput, reliability, and computing
capabilities (e.g., in-DRAM bulk data copy). Evaluating the system-wide
benefits of DRAM techniques is challenging as they often require modifications
across multiple layers of the computing stack. Prior works propose FPGA-based
platforms for rapid end-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM
chips. Unfortunately, existing platforms fall short in two major aspects: (1)
they require deep expertise in hardware description languages, limiting
accessibility; and (2) they are not designed to accurately model modern
computing systems.
  We introduce EasyDRAM, an FPGA-based framework for rapid and accurate
end-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM chips. EasyDRAM overcomes
the main drawbacks of prior FPGA-based platforms with two key ideas. First,
EasyDRAM removes the need for hardware description language expertise by
enabling developers to implement DRAM techniques using a high-level language
(C++). At runtime, EasyDRAM executes the software-defined memory system design
in a programmable memory controller. Second, EasyDRAM tackles a fundamental
challenge in accurately modeling modern systems: real processors typically
operate at higher clock frequencies than DRAM, a disparity that is difficult to
replicate on FPGA platforms. EasyDRAM addresses this challenge by decoupling
the processor-DRAM interface and advancing the system state using a novel
technique we call time scaling, which faithfully captures the timing behavior
of the modeled system.
  We believe and hope that EasyDRAM will enable innovative ideas in memory
system design to rapidly come to fruition. To aid future research EasyDRAM
implementation is open sourced at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/EasyDRAM.

Conclusion: 该架构在保持完全可编程性的同时，显著提升了性能和能效，支持更广泛的工作负载。

Abstract: The growing computational demands of machine learning (ML) workloads have
driven the design of ML accelerators aiming at an optimal tradeoff between
efficiency and flexibility. A widely explored architecture for flexible ML
accelerators is based on clusters of lightweight instruction processors sharing
multi-banked L1 memory, augmented with specialized instruction extensions for
key ML-related computations, such as matrix multiplication (matmul). However,
instruction extensions should be coupled with microarchitectural optimizations
that remove inefficiencies due to control flow (loop handling) and memory
access, without drastically increasing processor complexity. Moving from a
state-of-the-art (SoA) ML accelerator cluster based on RISC-V processors, we
propose a low-overhead optimized microarchitecture that eliminates these
inefficiencies almost entirely while retaining programmability. We introduce
"zero-overhead loop nests" to remove control overheads, and a "zero-conflict
memory subsystem", leveraging a novel double-buffering-aware interconnect, to
eliminate bank conflicts in L1 memory. With these enhancements, we attain
near-ideal utilizations between 96.1% and 99.4%, achieving 11% performance and
8% energy efficiency improvements over the baseline SoA RISC-V cluster. We
demonstrate comparable utilizations and performance to a specialized SoA
accelerator, with only 12% difference in energy efficiency, while providing a
fully-programmable general-purpose solution supporting a significantly wider
range of workloads.

Conclusion: MARS通过存储中心设计有效解决了RSGA的数据移动和计算瓶颈，为高性能、低能耗的基因组分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Raw signal genome analysis (RSGA) has emerged as a promising approach to
enable real-time genome analysis by directly analyzing raw electrical signals.
However, rapid advancements in sequencing technologies make it increasingly
difficult for software-based RSGA to match the throughput of raw signal
generation. This paper demonstrates that while hardware acceleration techniques
can significantly accelerate RSGA, the high volume of genomic data shifts the
performance and energy bottleneck from computation to I/O data movement. As
sequencing throughput increases, I/O overhead becomes the main contributor to
both runtime and energy consumption. Therefore, there is a need to design a
high-performance, energy-efficient system for RSGA that can both alleviate the
data movement bottleneck and provide large acceleration capabilities. We
propose MARS, a storage-centric system that leverages the heterogeneous
resources within modern storage systems (e.g., storage-internal DRAM, storage
controller, flash chips) alongside their large storage capacity to tackle both
data movement and computational overheads of RSGA in an area-efficient and
low-cost manner. MARS accelerates RSGA through a novel hardware/software
co-design approach. First, MARS modifies the RSGA pipeline via two filtering
mechanisms and a quantization scheme, reducing hardware demands and optimizing
for in-storage execution. Second, MARS accelerates the RSGA steps directly
within the storage by leveraging both Processing-Near-Memory and
Processing-Using-Memory paradigms. Third, MARS orchestrates the execution of
all steps to fully exploit in-storage parallelism and minimize data movement.
Our evaluation shows that MARS outperforms basecalling-based software and
hardware-accelerated state-of-the-art read mapping pipelines by 93x and 40x, on
average across different datasets, while reducing their energy consumption by
427x and 72x.

issues in current evaluation practices, such as the concerning similarity among

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最大独立集问题是经典优化问题，但在分布式环境中研究较少，尤其是在加权和有界树性图的情况下。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 对于树，提出了紧的复杂度界限；对于有界树性图，提出了两种算法，一种是基于局部舍入框架的直接应用，另一种改进了现有结果。

Result: 在树中，证明了$(1-\epsilon)$-近似解的紧复杂度为$\Theta(\log^*(n) / \epsilon)$；在有界树性图中，提出了两种近似算法，分别达到$(1-\epsilon)\cdot \frac{w(V)}{4\beta}$和$(1-\epsilon)\cdot\frac{w(V)}{2\beta+1}$的近似比。

Conclusion: 本文为加权最大独立集问题在树和有界树性图中的分布式算法提供了紧的复杂度界限和改进的近似结果，填补了相关研究的空白。

Abstract: The maximum independent set problem is a classic optimization problem that
has also been studied quite intensively in the distributed setting. While the
problem is hard to approximate in general, there are good approximation
algorithms known for several sparse graph families. In this paper, we consider
deterministic distributed CONGEST algorithms for the weighted version of the
problem in trees and graphs of bounded arboricity.
  For trees, we prove that the task of deterministically computing a
$(1-\epsilon)$-approximate solution to the maximum weight independent set
(MWIS) problem has a tight $\Theta(\log^*(n) / \epsilon)$ complexity. The lower
bound already holds on unweighted oriented paths. On the upper bound side, we
show that the bound can be achieved even in unrooted trees.
  For graphs $G=(V,E)$ of arboricity $\beta>1$, we give two algorithms. If the
sum of all node weights is $w(V)$, we show that for any $\epsilon>0$, an
independent set of weight at least $(1-\epsilon)\cdot \frac{w(V)}{4\beta}$ can
be computed in $O(\log^2(\beta/\epsilon)/\epsilon + \log^* n)$ rounds. This
result is obtained by a direct application of the local rounding framework of
Faour, Ghaffari, Grunau, Kuhn, and Rozho\v{n} [SODA '23]. We further show that
for any $\epsilon>0$, an independent set of weight at least
$(1-\epsilon)\cdot\frac{w(V)}{2\beta+1}$ can be computed in
$O(\log^3(\beta)\cdot\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon^2 \cdot\log n)$ rounds. This
improves on a recent result of Gil [OPODIS '23], who showed that a
$1/\lfloor(2+\epsilon)\beta\rfloor$-approximation to the MWIS problem can be
computed in $O(\beta\cdot\log n)$ rounds. As an intermediate step, we design an
algorithm to compute an independent set of total weight at least
$(1-\epsilon)\cdot\sum_{v\in V}\frac{w(v)}{deg(v)+1}$ in time
$O(\log^3(\Delta)\cdot\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon + \log^* n)$, where $\Delta$ is
the maximum degree of the graph.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于代理的边缘计算自动扩展框架，通过动态调整硬件资源和内部服务配置，在资源受限的环境中最大化需求满足。比较了四种扩展代理，结果显示均能实现可接受的SLO性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算因严格的资源限制需要更灵活的扩展行为，传统自动扩展方法不再适用。

Method: 采用基于代理的自动扩展框架，动态调整硬件资源和内部服务配置，比较了四种代理类型。

Result: 所有代理均实现可接受的SLO性能，不同代理具有不同的收敛特性。

Conclusion: 多维代理自动扩展在边缘环境中可行，鼓励未来研究。

Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource
constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple
elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling
framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service
configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained
environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q
Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two
real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual
recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve
acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q
Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly,
and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with
practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the
viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments
and encourage future work in this research direction.

TL;DR: 医学基础模型（如语言模型、视觉语言模型和多模态模型）在临床应用中存在局限性，难以动态适应新环境或人群。本文提出“上下文切换”AI，无需重新训练即可适应不同医疗场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学AI模型在适应新人群、专业或环境时需微调或提示，导致无法动态调整行为，易产生上下文错误。

Method: 提出“上下文切换”AI概念，模型能动态适应不同医疗场景（如专科、人群、工作流程）。

Result: 通过上下文切换，AI可更灵活地诊断和治疗多种疾病，提升医疗可及性。

Conclusion: 上下文切换AI有望解决医学模型的动态适应性不足问题，推动医疗AI的广泛应用。

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

Motivation: 当前的科学基准主要关注MLLMs的知识理解能力，而忽视了其感知和推理能力的评估，因此需要更全面的测试标准。

Method: SFE基准包含830个专家验证的视觉问答对，覆盖66个多模态任务和五个高价值学科。

Result: 实验显示，当前最先进的GPT-o3和InternVL-3在SFE上的表现仅为34.08%和26.52%，表明MLLMs在科学领域仍有很大提升空间。

Conclusion: SFE的见解有望推动AI在科学发现中的进一步发展。

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning
based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise.
Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this
discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific
benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities
of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning
abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%
and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in
scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further
developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text
generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music,
video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory
modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary
generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends,
and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques
and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and
diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and
modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify
open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This
survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical
paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal
systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于注意力视频扩散（AVD）的模型，用于生成交通事故视频片段，以解决交通场景中因果部分难以识别和数据偏差的问题。通过无额外标注的数据集训练，AVD结合等变TAA（EQ-TAA）方法，取得了与现有方法竞争的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 交通场景中的交通事故预测（TAA）存在因果部分难以识别和数据偏差的问题，导致背景混杂。当前方法需要大量标注，且难以应对场景的长尾、不确定性和快速变化特性。

Method: 提出AVD模型，通过文本提示生成因果视频帧，从正常片段合成事故片段，同时保持视频生成后的风格和内容。结合EQ-TAA方法，使用等变三重损失进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，AVD和EQ-TAA在性能上优于现有方法，且无需额外标注。

Conclusion: AVD和EQ-TAA为解决TAA中的背景混杂问题提供了有效方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging
problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches
typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious
annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,
uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real
causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by
data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an
Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident
video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal
clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on
accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content
of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using
datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.
Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant
triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated
pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,
and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been
obtained.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应双模态框架，通过动态分支选择、双向跨模态GAN和混合训练协议，显著提升HER2评估的准确性，适用于资源有限的环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HER2评估模型通常单独分析H&E或IHC图像，而临床依赖两者的协同解释。但由于工作流程复杂性和成本限制，难以同时获取两种模态。

Method: 1) 动态分支选择器；2) 双向跨模态GAN；3) 混合训练协议。

Result: 单模态H&E预测准确率从71.44%提升至94.25%，双模态准确率达95.09%，IHC输入可靠性为90.28%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过弹性设计，显著提升HER2评估性能，适用于资源有限的环境。

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&E or
IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic
interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often
hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive
bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction
through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either
single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse
healthcare settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频驱动的3D面部动画存在两个主要问题：一是依赖单模态控制信号，未能充分利用多模态的互补性；二是确定性回归方法限制了情感表达的自然性和多样性。

Method: 采用FLAME中心的多模态情感绑定策略和注意力潜扩散模型，结合对比学习和内容感知注意力层，实现灵活的情感控制和丰富的运动多样性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多数指标上优于现有方法，情感相似性提升了21.6%，同时保持了自然的面部动态。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态融合和扩散模型，显著提升了3D面部动画的表现力和可控性。

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant
challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or
emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for
comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based
mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and
non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To
address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for
controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that
aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive
learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and
(2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and
emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining
temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most
metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving
physiologically plausible facial dynamics. Project Page:

Conclusion: 为基于叙事的视觉媒体分析、交互式叙事和多模态推理提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the
structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media
such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple
levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It
represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic,
spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct
multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and
actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions.
These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over
story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset
and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse
narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character
appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show
high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and
interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation
for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal
reasoning in visual media.

Conclusion: WDMIR框架通过频域分析和跨模态交互，有效提升了多模态意图识别的准确性，尤其在非语言信息处理上表现突出。

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user
intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio
and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they
often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This
paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)
framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis
of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a
wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and
integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling
fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction
mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to
trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and
non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by
1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven
fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information
from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when
analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了模型能够跟随未见过的指令，展示了零样本指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: 对话延续训练是一种有效的方法，能够在不依赖多任务指令调优的情况下提升模型的指令跟随能力。

Abstract: We propose an instruction-following audio comprehension model that leverages
the dialogue continuation ability of large language models (LLMs). Instead of
directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method
trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a
dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation
problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's
meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables
zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction
tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on
AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene
question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various
unseen instructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音识别器通常仅在特定环境下表现最佳，需要适应新环境或新说话者。然而，适应新说话者时，数据通常不足且未标记，导致传统方法不够鲁棒。

Method: 1. 提出了一种新的损失函数，基于完整假设的条件熵，而非单一伪标签的交叉熵。2. 引入“说话者编码”，用短向量表征说话者特征，减少数据需求。

Result: 在噪声增强的Common Voice数据集上，1分钟适应数据下词错误率相对降低20%，10分钟时提升至29%。

Conclusion: 该方法在少量未标记数据下显著提升了语音识别器的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"

minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

*Jun Bai,Rajib Rana,Di Wu,Youyang Qu,Xiaohui Tao,Ji Zhang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: FedMLAC是一个统一框架，通过双向知识蒸馏和层剪枝聚合策略，解决联邦音频分类中的数据异构性、模型异构性和数据中毒问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦音频分类面临数据异构性、模型异构性和数据中毒三大挑战，现有方法缺乏统一解决方案。

Method: 提出FedMLAC框架，采用双模型架构（个性化本地模型和轻量级全局插件模型），结合双向知识蒸馏和层剪枝聚合策略。

Result: 在四个音频分类基准测试中，FedMLAC在分类准确性和抗噪性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedMLAC为联邦音频分类提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides a privacy-preserving paradigm for training
audio classification (AC) models across distributed clients without sharing raw
data. However, Federated Audio Classification (FedAC) faces three critical
challenges that substantially hinder performance: data heterogeneity, model
heterogeneity, and data poisoning. While prior works have attempted to address
these issues, they are typically treated independently, lacking a unified and
robust solution suited to real-world federated audio scenarios. To bridge this
gap, we propose FedMLAC, a unified mutual learning framework designed to
simultaneously tackle these challenges in FedAC. Specifically, FedMLAC
introduces a dual-model architecture on each client, comprising a personalized
local AC model and a lightweight, globally shared Plug-in model. Through
bidirectional knowledge distillation, the Plug-in model enables global
knowledge transfer while adapting to client-specific data distributions, thus
supporting both generalization and personalization. To further enhance
robustness against corrupted audio data, we develop a Layer-wise Pruning
Aggregation (LPA) strategy that filters unreliable Plug-in model updates based
on parameter deviations during server-side aggregation. Extensive experiments
on four diverse audio classification benchmarks, spanning both speech and
non-speech tasks, demonstrate that FedMLAC consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness to
noisy data.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance
for future research in this rapidly evolving area. For more information,

TL;DR: 本文研究了音频-LLM架构设计对跨模态信息传递的影响，提出了延迟音频集成、仅通过注意力模块探测音频表征以及多编码器集成等方法，实验验证了这些改进的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管音频-LLM在应用层面取得了快速进展，但其底层机制（如音频编码器与LLM的高效交互）仍未被充分探索。本文旨在通过架构设计优化跨模态信息传递。

Method: 从标准音频-LLM架构出发，提出并评估了延迟音频集成、仅通过注意力模块探测音频表征以及多编码器集成等改进方法。实验基于560万音频-文本对数据集进行。

Result: 实验表明，改进后的架构在跨模态信息传递上实现了10%至60%的相对提升。

Conclusion: 通过系统优化音频-LLM的架构设计，可以有效提升跨模态信息传递效率，为音频-LLM的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

TL;DR: RAAI是一种无需训练、模型无关的框架，通过检测拒绝信号并注入预定义短语，有效提升LLM生成有害内容的比率，同时增强模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，利用LLM攻击技术生成合成数据以提升模型安全性。

Method: 提出Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI)，通过检测拒绝信号并自适应注入短语，生成有害但流畅的补全。

Result: RAAI将有害响应率从2.15%提升至61.04%，且用其合成数据微调的LLM在保持通用能力的同时增强了对有害提示的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LLM攻击技术可转化为实用工具，用于可扩展且可控的安全性对齐。

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

TL;DR: 论文提出Private Memorization Editing (PME)方法，通过编辑模型对训练数据的记忆，防止大语言模型泄露个人隐私信息（PII）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）可能记忆并泄露个人隐私信息（PII），需要一种方法防止此类泄漏。

Method: 提出PME方法，检测并编辑模型记忆的PII，利用模型的记忆能力作为隐私防御策略。

Result: PME有效减少PII泄漏，某些情况下将隐私攻击准确率降至零，且不影响模型性能。

Conclusion: PME是一种有效的隐私防御方法，能显著降低LLMs的隐私泄漏风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在评估文本到图像模型安全性时存在局限，无法同时实现高毒性和绕过安全机制，亟需可靠工具填补这一空白。

Method: 结合监督微调和强化学习，通过多奖励信号引导生成对抗性提示，增强逃避能力和图像毒性。

Result: 生成的对抗性提示在商业文本到图像模型中表现出色，揭示了实际安全弱点。

Conclusion: GenBreak为评估防御性文本到图像模型的安全性提供了有效工具，揭示了潜在的高风险漏洞。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

Motivation: 大型语言模型代理在处理敏感数据时存在隐私泄露风险，现有单轮防御措施不足以应对多轮交互中的漏洞。

Method: 提出CMPL框架，采用迭代探测策略模拟多轮对话，系统性测试隐私漏洞。

Result: CMPL在多种场景下成功揭示了现有单轮防御无法检测的隐私风险。

Conclusion: CMPL是一种有效的诊断工具，提供了量化风险指标和开放基准，用于评估对话隐私。

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

Motivation: 评估机器遗忘方法的有效性，揭示其在提示攻击下的脆弱性，挑战现有关于遗忘效果的假设。

Method: 系统评估八种遗忘技术，采用输出、对数概率和探针分析，检测未遗忘知识的可检索性。

Result: ELM方法在特定提示攻击下表现脆弱（如恢复57.3%准确率），而RMU和TAR表现稳健。对数分析显示未遗忘知识未被隐藏。

Conclusion: 现有遗忘方法的有效性需重新评估，需开发更可靠的评估框架以区分真实知识移除与表面输出抑制。

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

Result: 研究表明，结合QKD、BB84和QOTP的方法能有效防御量子计算机攻击，确保云数据安全。

Conclusion: 量子密码学为云计算提供了当前和未来的数据安全保障，提升云存储的安全性。

Abstract: Cloud computing has made storing and accessing data easier but keeping it
secure is a big challenge nowadays. Traditional methods of ensuring data may
not be strong enough in the future when powerful quantum computers become
available. To solve this problem, this study uses quantum cryptography to
protect data in the cloud environment. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) creates
secure keys by sending information using quantum particles like photons.
Specifically, we use the BB84 protocol, a simple and reliable way to make
secure keys that cannot be stolen without detection. To protect the data, we
use the Quantum One Time pad (QOTP) for encryption and decryption, ensuring the
data stays completely private. This study shows how these Quantum methods can
be applied in cloud systems to provide a strong defense against hackers, even
if they have access to quantum computers. The combination of QKD, BB84, and
QOTP creates a safe and reliable way to keep data secure when it is stored or
shared in the cloud. Using quantum cryptography, this paper provides a way to
ensure data security now and in the future, making cloud computing safer for
everyone to store their data securely and safely.

Conclusion: 模块化框架为高效导航系统提供了可扩展的基础，未来可通过增强环境先验和扩展多模态输入进一步优化。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal
challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation
settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient
navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement
through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input

Conclusion: EyeRobot展示了任务驱动的注视行为如何提升机器人操作能力，特别是在大范围工作空间中。

Abstract: Humans do not passively observe the visual world -- we actively look in order
to act. Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system
with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We
develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings
and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We
accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a
360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports
rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze
on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the
hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye
observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct
action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks
towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements
a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small
compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable
fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.
We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring
manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest
EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate
manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera. See project site for

Motivation: 研究CBPV与π演算之间的编码关系，解决形式化过程中的技术挑战，并验证编码的合理性。

Method: 通过手工证明编码的正确性和完备性，并针对π-i-calculus进行优化，同时对比Milner的编码方法。

Result: 编码在π-i-calculus中满足正确性和完备性，且符合Gorla的标准。部分证明已在Coq中形式化。

Conclusion: 该编码方法在理论和实践中均表现出色，未来可进一步完成形式化证明。

Abstract: In this report we define an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value
lambda-calculus (CBPV) in the pi-calculus, and prove that our encoding is both
sound and complete. We present informal (by-hand) proofs of soundness,
completeness, and all required lemmas. The encoding is specialized to the
internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to circumvent certain challenges
associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization, and it also helps
with bisimulation as early-, late- and open-bisimulation coincide in this
setting, furthermore bisimulation is a congruence. Additionally, we argue that
our encoding also satisfies the five criteria for good encodings proposed by
Gorla, as well as show similarities between Milners and our encoding. This
paper includes encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic
pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus. We begin a formalization of the proof in
Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.
Not all lemmas used in the formalization are themselves formally proven.
However, we argue that the non-proven lemmas are reasonable, as they are proven
by hand, or amount to Coq formalities that are straightforward given informal
arguments.

Method: 定义了三种同步策略：被动策略（基线）、主动策略（逐步减慢）和混合策略（减少同步间隙并增加纠错轮次）。

Result: 主动策略将逻辑错误率降低2.4倍，混合策略降低3.4倍，同时解码延迟提升2.2倍。

Conclusion: 提出的同步策略有效降低了逻辑错误率并提升了系统性能，为容错量子计算提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes store information reliably in logical
qubits by encoding them in a larger number of less reliable qubits. The surface
code, known for its high resilience to physical errors, is a leading candidate
for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Logical qubits encoded with the
surface code can be in different phases of their syndrome generation cycle,
thereby introducing desynchronization in the system. This can occur due to the
production of non-Clifford states, dropouts due to fabrication defects, and the
use of other QEC codes with the surface code to reduce resource requirements.
Logical operations require the syndrome generation cycles of the logical qubits
involved to be synchronized. This requires the leading qubit to pause or slow
down its cycle, allowing more errors to accumulate before the next cycle,
thereby increasing the risk of uncorrectable errors.
  To synchronize the syndrome generation cycles of logical qubits, we define
three policies - Passive, Active, and Hybrid. The Passive policy is the
baseline, and the simplest, wherein the leading logical qubits idle until they
are synchronized with the remaining logical qubits. On the other hand, the
Active policy aims to slow the leading logical qubits down gradually, by
inserting short idle periods before multiple code cycles. This approach reduces
the logical error rate (LER) by up to 2.4x compared to the Passive policy. The
Hybrid policy further reduces the LER by up to 3.4x by reducing the
synchronization slack and running a few additional rounds of error correction.
Furthermore, the reduction in the logical error rate with the proposed
synchronization policies enables a speedup in decoding latency of up to 2.2x
with a circuit-level noise model.

*Chen-Chia Chang,Wan-Hsuan Lin,Yikang Shen,Yiran Chen,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LaMAGIC2提出了一种新的电路拓扑生成方法SFCI，解决了现有方法在效率和精度上的不足，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代应用对模拟电路设计的定制化需求高，但现有方法因电路表述效率低和数值输入精度不足而受限。

Method: LaMAGIC2采用SFCI（简洁浮点输入规范表述），通过标识符表示降低复杂度至O(|V|)，并提升数值精度敏感性。

Result: 实验显示LaMAGIC2在0.01的严格容差下成功率提高34%，MSE降低10倍，且对复杂电路的适应性提升58.5%。

Conclusion: LaMAGIC2为模拟拓扑生成提供了一个高效、精确且适应性强的框架。

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a
prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with
more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

TL;DR: Omni-DPO 是一种双视角优化框架，通过自适应加权样本，提升数据利用率和模型性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 DPO 方法忽视偏好对的质量差异，导致数据利用和性能不佳。

Method: 提出 Omni-DPO，结合偏好对质量和模型学习动态，自适应加权样本。

Result: 在文本理解和数学推理任务中，Omni-DPO 显著优于基线方法，如 Gemma-2-9b-it 在 Arena-Hard 上超越 Claude 3 Opus 6.7 分。

Conclusion: Omni-DPO 通过双视角优化，有效提升性能，具有广泛适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

Motivation: 维基百科上的恶意傀儡账户检测对维护互联网可靠信息和防止虚假信息传播至关重要，但现有方法难以适应特定作者行为。

Result: 结果显示，元学习方法显著优于预训练模型，提高了预测精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为开放编辑平台上的傀儡账户检测提供了新思路，并发布了新数据集以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

Motivation: 现有基于大型语言模型（LLM）的交互式学习缺乏理论框架，本文旨在填补这一空白，为语言反馈学习提供理论基础。

Method: 提出LLF问题，定义转移困惑维度作为复杂性度量，并设计无遗憾算法HELiX，通过顺序交互解决问题。

Result: 理论证明转移困惑维度能有效反映学习复杂性，实验显示HELiX在语言反馈学习中表现优异，优于单纯依赖LLM提示的方法。

Conclusion: 本文为语言反馈学习提供了首个理论框架和算法，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

Method: 提出PropInfer基准任务，基于ChatDoctor数据集，设计两种攻击方法：基于提示的生成攻击和利用词频信号的影子模型攻击。

Result: 实验证明攻击在多预训练LLMs中成功，揭示了LLMs的新漏洞。

Conclusion: LLMs在微调后存在泄露敏感属性的风险，需进一步研究防御方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

Method: 提出因果表示学习框架，将基准性能建模为潜在能力因素的线性变换，并控制基础模型作为混杂因素。

Result: 在包含1500多个模型的数据集上，识别出一个三节点线性因果结构，揭示了从通用问题解决能力到数学推理能力的因果方向。

Conclusion: 研究强调了控制基础模型变异的重要性，为揭示潜在能力间的因果关系提供了科学见解。

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列数据通常不规则、多模态且杂乱，而现有研究多基于干净、规则的单模态数据，导致与实际应用脱节。

Method: Time-IMM数据集捕捉了九种不规则性机制，IMM-TSF库提供异步融合模块（如时间戳到文本融合和多模态融合）及评估方法。

Result: 实验表明，显式建模多模态不规则数据显著提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: Time-IMM和IMM-TSF为现实条件下时间序列分析提供了基础工具和数据集。

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the
benchmark library can be accessed at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在处理信号重叠的ECG记录时的不足，提升数字化精度。

Method: 两阶段流程：1) 使用U-Net分割网络隔离ECG主迹线；2) 通过自适应网格检测模块将二进制掩码转换为时间序列信号。

Result: U-Net的IoU为0.87；在非重叠和重叠信号上，MSE和Pearson相关系数均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了ECG数字化精度，尤其在信号重叠情况下，为研究和临床应用提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of

Conclusion: Duo方法通过结合高斯扩散技术，显著提升了离散扩散模型的性能，实现了高效训练和快速采样。

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

Conclusion: 建议采用更现实的评估方法和内部缓解策略，确保招聘公平。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

Motivation: 由于法规合规、版权保护和隐私需求，LLM的遗忘问题日益重要，但现有方法在高影响力数据遗忘时会导致模型效用下降。

Method: GUARD引入轻量级数据归因指标，量化遗忘集和保留集的“对齐”程度，并设计自适应非均匀遗忘权重的目标函数。

Conclusion: GUARD通过数据归因和自适应权重分配，有效平衡遗忘与保留，为LLM遗忘问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中的分布外识别问题，提出双曲嵌入方法以更好地区分样本。

Result: 在13个数据集和13种评分函数上的实验表明，该方法优于现有分布外识别方法和其他双曲方法。

Conclusion: 双曲嵌入方法在分布外识别中表现优异，支持层次化分布外泛化。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

Result: 发现轨迹具有低维和“回旋镖”形状的规律性，动态规划方法显著提升生成性能。

Conclusion: 采样轨迹的几何规律性为优化扩散模型提供了新思路，动态规划方法简单高效。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

Conclusion: 该方法为理解扩散模型潜在空间的复杂结构及其与相变现象的联系提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: ReGuidance是一种简单的方法，用于提升基于扩散模型的逆问题求解中的样本真实性和奖励效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无训练方法（如DPS）在低信噪比的逆问题中容易偏离数据流形，导致输出不真实。

Method: 通过反转候选解运行无条件概率流ODE，生成潜在初始化，再用于DPS。

Result: 在困难逆问题（如大范围修复和高倍超分辨率）中，ReGuidance显著提升了样本质量和测量一致性。

Conclusion: ReGuidance在提升奖励的同时使候选解更接近数据流形，为DPS提供了首个严格算法保证。

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

Abstract: The ever-increasing complexity of HW/SW systems presents a persistent
challenge, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive, where
extensive testing is imperative. However, the availability of hardware often
lags behind, hindering early-stage software development. To address this,
Virtual Platforms (VPs) based on the SystemC TLM-2.0 standard have emerged as a
pivotal solution, enabling pre-silicon execution and testing of unmodified

containerization to encapsulate VPs in order to reduce environment dependencies
and enable cloud deployment for fast, parallelized test execution, as well as
open-source VP technologies such as QEMU and VCML to obviate the need for seat
licenses. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we present an Artificial
Intelligence (AI) accelerator VP case study. Through our research, we offer a
robust solution to address the challenges posed by the complexity of HW/SW
systems, with practical implications for accelerating HW/SW co-development.

Abstract: Accurate classification of software bugs is essential for improving software
quality. This paper presents a rule-based automated framework for classifying
issues in quantum software repositories by bug type, category, severity, and
impacted quality attributes, with additional focus on quantum-specific bug
types. The framework applies keyword and heuristic-based techniques tailored to
quantum computing. To assess its reliability, we manually classified a
stratified sample of 4,984 issues from a dataset of 12,910 issues across 36
Qiskit repositories. Automated classifications were compared with ground truth
using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The framework achieved up to
85.21% accuracy, with F1-scores ranging from 0.7075 (severity) to 0.8393
(quality attribute). Statistical validation via paired t-tests and Cohen's
Kappa showed substantial to almost perfect agreement for bug type (k = 0.696),
category (k = 0.826), quality attribute (k = 0.818), and quantum-specific bug
type (k = 0.712). Severity classification showed slight agreement (k = 0.162),
suggesting room for improvement. Large-scale analysis revealed that classical
bugs dominate (67.2%), with quantum-specific bugs at 27.3%. Frequent bug
categories included compatibility, functional, and quantum-specific defects,
while usability, maintainability, and interoperability were the most impacted
quality attributes. Most issues (93.7%) were low severity; only 4.3% were
critical. A detailed review of 1,550 quantum-specific bugs showed that over
half involved quantum circuit-level problems, followed by gate errors and
hardware-related issues.

Result: 模拟结果显示，该算法在有限能量下显著提高了观测精度，且无需过滤高频信息。

Conclusion: 该算法有效解决了相机位置优化问题，提升了眼到手配置的观测精度，适用于自动化制造任务。

Abstract: Visual servoing technology has been well developed and applied in many
automated manufacturing tasks, especially in tools' pose alignment. To access a
full global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or
eye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing
environment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control
and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have
discussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration.
In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the
camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches
for the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this
algorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is
unreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy
available for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the
algorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the
search policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging
technique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation
accuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering
out high-frequency information in the original image. An automated
manufacturing application has been simulated and the results show the success
of this algorithm's improvement of observation precision with limited energy.

Combining domain-based CP with STP of vectors, a new CP is proposed. Since
there is no zero or any other padding, it can avoid the junk information caused

developed. Its application to image and third order signal identifications is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成方法在生成多场景和角色的连贯叙事视频时存在挑战，如叙事脱节和节奏问题，以及模型不稳定性导致的视觉连续性差。

Result: 实验表明，AniMaker在VBench和AniEval等指标上表现优异，显著提升了多候选生成的效率和动画质量。

Conclusion: AniMaker通过智能片段生成和评估，推动了AI生成叙事动画向生产标准迈进。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent
storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains
challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into
fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues.
Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that
even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output
animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these
obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient
multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus
creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text
input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the
Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip
generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent
for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical
components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to
generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in
Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot
animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level
consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering
each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments
demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular
metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while
significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing
AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors, particularly contrast-enhancing regions
visible in post-contrast MRI (areas highlighted by contrast agent injection),
is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment planning but remains
challenging. However, current methods exhibit notable performance degradation
in segmenting these enhancing brain tumor areas, largely due to insufficient
consideration of MRI-specific tumor features such as complex textures and
directional variations. To address this, we propose the Harmonized Frequency
Fusion Network (HFF-Net), which rethinks brain tumor segmentation from a
frequency-domain perspective. To comprehensively characterize tumor regions, we
develop a Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) module that separates MRI images
into low-frequency components, capturing smooth tumor contours and
high-frequency components, highlighting detailed textures and directional
edges. To further enhance sensitivity to tumor boundaries, we introduce an
Adaptive Laplacian Convolution (ALC) module that adaptively emphasizes critical
high-frequency details using dynamically updated convolution kernels. To
effectively fuse tumor features across multiple scales, we design a Frequency
Domain Cross-Attention (FDCA) integrating semantic, positional, and
slice-specific information. We further validate and interpret frequency-domain
improvements through visualization, theoretical reasoning, and experimental
analyses. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that
HFF-Net achieves an average relative improvement of 4.48\% (ranging from 2.39\%
to 7.72\%) in the mean Dice scores across the three major subregions, and an
average relative improvement of 7.33% (ranging from 5.96% to 8.64%) in the
segmentation of contrast-enhancing tumor regions, while maintaining favorable
computational efficiency and clinical applicability. Code:

Conclusion: CCELLA方法在数据稀缺条件下显著提升了医学图像合成质量和分类器性能，具有较高的科学可访问性。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges
affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical
LDM training typically relies on performance- or scientific
accessibility-limiting strategies including a reliance on short-prompt text
encoders, the reuse of non-medical LDMs, or a requirement for fine-tuning with
large data volumes. We propose a Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language
model Adapter (CCELLA) to address these limitations. CCELLA is a novel
dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net
with non-medical large language model-encoded text features through
cross-attention and with pathology classification through the timestep
embedding. We also propose a joint loss function and a data-efficient LDM
training framework. In combination, these strategies enable
pathology-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis
given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance
and scientific accessibility. Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a
size-limited prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent
foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer
prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method to the training
dataset improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier
solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to
training on real images alone.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning has enabled accurate pathology detection in brain
MRI, but requires training data from diseased subjects that may not be readily
available in some scenarios, for example, in the case of rare diseases.
Reconstruction-based unsupervised anomaly detection, in particular using
diffusion models, has gained popularity in the medical field as it allows for
training on healthy images alone, eliminating the need for large
disease-specific cohorts. These methods assume that a model trained on normal
data cannot accurately represent or reconstruct anomalies. However, this
assumption often fails with models failing to reconstruct healthy tissue or
accurately reconstruct abnormal regions i.e., failing to remove anomalies. In
this work, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion model framework for
anomaly detection and healthy image reconstruction in brain MRI. Our weakly
supervised approach integrates synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images
into the modeling process to better guide the reconstruction of healthy images.
To generate these pseudo-pathologies, we apply fluid-driven anomaly
randomization to augment real pathology segmentation maps from an auxiliary
dataset, ensuring that the synthetic anomalies are both realistic and
anatomically coherent. We evaluate our model's ability to detect pathology,
using both synthetic anomaly datasets and real pathology from the ATLAS
dataset. In our extensive experiments, our model: (i) consistently outperforms
variational autoencoders, and conditional and unconditional latent diffusion;
and (ii) surpasses on most datasets, the performance of supervised inpainting
methods with access to paired diseased/healthy images.

Result: 在心脏CINE MRI数据集上表现优异，尤其在保留旋转对称结构方面。

Conclusion: DUN-SRE在动态MRI重建任务中具有广泛适用性和优越性能。

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,
including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal
symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry
priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,
especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant
convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting
spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model
temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior
in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep
Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for
Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance
through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it
integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified
deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of
spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction
process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics
in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization
mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing
symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets
demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization
capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based
segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large
amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged
as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in
volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that
primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,
we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary
advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The
Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference
learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.
Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks
demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly
available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data
further confirm the superiority of our approach. Code and data have been
released at https://github.com/SIAT-CT-LAB/SWDL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像通常来自多个领域，领域偏移会影响分割模型的性能。现有领域随机化方法依赖图像风格扰动且忽略过增强的负面影响。

Method: 提出ConStyX方法，增强训练数据的内容和风格，覆盖更广的数据领域，并在训练中利用良好增强特征，减少过增强的负面影响。

Result: 多领域实验表明，ConStyX具有优越的泛化性能。

Conclusion: ConStyX通过内容和风格增强有效解决了医学图像分割的领域泛化问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical images are usually collected from multiple domains, leading to domain
shifts that impair the performance of medical image segmentation models. Domain
Generalization (DG) aims to address this issue by training a robust model with
strong generalizability. Recently, numerous domain randomization-based DG
methods have been proposed. However, these methods suffer from the following
limitations: 1) constrained efficiency of domain randomization due to their
exclusive dependence on image style perturbation, and 2) neglect of the adverse
effects of over-augmented images on model training. To address these issues, we
propose a novel domain randomization-based DG method, called content style
augmentation (ConStyX), for generalizable medical image segmentation.
Specifically, ConStyX 1) augments the content and style of training data,
allowing the augmented training data to better cover a wider range of data
domains, and 2) leverages well-augmented features while mitigating the negative
effects of over-augmented features during model training. Extensive experiments
across multiple domains demonstrate that our ConStyX achieves superior
generalization performance. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割方法（CNN、Transformer或混合架构）各有局限性，而RWKV模型在长距离建模和计算效率上表现优异，但尚未充分探索预训练VRWKV模型的潜力。

Method: 提出Med-URWKV，基于U-Net框架，结合ImageNet预训练的VRWKV编码器，首次在医学领域实现纯RWKV分割模型。

Result: 在七个数据集上的实验表明，Med-URWKV性能优于或媲美从头训练的RWKV模型，验证了预训练编码器的有效性。

Conclusion: Med-URWKV展示了预训练VRWKV编码器在医学图像分割中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a fundamental and key technology in
computer-aided diagnosis and treatment. Previous methods can be broadly
classified into three categories: convolutional neural network (CNN) based,
Transformer based, and hybrid architectures that combine both. However, each of
them has its own limitations, such as restricted receptive fields in CNNs or
the computational overhead caused by the quadratic complexity of Transformers.
Recently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model has emerged as a
promising alternative for various vision tasks, offering strong long-range
modeling capabilities with linear computational complexity. Some studies have
also adapted RWKV to medical image segmentation tasks, achieving competitive
performance. However, most of these studies focus on modifications to the
Vision-RWKV (VRWKV) mechanism and train models from scratch, without exploring
the potential advantages of leveraging pre-trained VRWKV models for medical
image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose Med-URWKV, a pure
RWKV-based architecture built upon the U-Net framework, which incorporates
ImageNet-based pretraining to further explore the potential of RWKV in medical
image segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Med-URWKV is the first
pure RWKV segmentation model in the medical field that can directly reuse a
large-scale pre-trained VRWKV encoder. Experimental results on seven datasets
demonstrate that Med-URWKV achieves comparable or even superior segmentation
performance compared to other carefully optimized RWKV models trained from
scratch. This validates the effectiveness of using a pretrained VRWKV encoder
in enhancing model performance. The codes will be released.

Motivation: 数字病理学中的质量保证是一个关键但未被充分探索的领域，现有方法未充分利用深度学习技术，存在改进空间。

Method: 开发了一种AI算法，通过分析切片并分类伪影类型，生成伪影定位图。使用内部开发的软件ZAPP标注数据，并比较不同模型和参数的性能。

Result: 实验表明，混合设计（单伪影二元模型和多实例模型）能优化伪影检测。

Conclusion: 提出的混合设计算法在数字病理学质量保证中具有潜力，可显著减少人工审查时间。

Abstract: Quality assurance is a critical but underexplored area in digital pathology,
where even minor artifacts can have significant effects. Artifacts have been
shown to negatively impact the performance of AI diagnostic models. In current
practice, trained staff manually review digitized images prior to release of
these slides to pathologists which are then used to render a diagnosis.
Conventional image processing approaches, provide a foundation for detecting
artifacts on digital pathology slides. However, current tools do not leverage
deep learning, which has the potential to improve detection accuracy and
scalability. Despite these advancements, methods for quality assurance in
digital pathology remain limited, presenting a gap for innovation.
  We propose an AI algorithm designed to screen digital pathology slides by
analyzing tiles and categorizing them into one of 10 predefined artifact types
or as background. This algorithm identifies and localizes artifacts, creating a
map that highlights regions of interest. By directing human operators to
specific tiles affected by artifacts, the algorithm minimizes the time and
effort required to manually review entire slides for quality issues.
  From internal archives and The Cancer Genome Atlas, 133 whole slide images
were selected and 10 artifacts were annotated using an internally developed
software ZAPP (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Ablation study of multiple
models at different tile sizes and magnification was performed. InceptionResNet
was selected. Single artifact models were trained and tested, followed by a
limited multiple instance model with artifacts that performed well together
(chatter, fold, and pen). From the results of this study we suggest a hybrid
design for artifact screening composed of both single artifact binary models as
well as multiple instance models to optimize detection of each artifact.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级资源感知混合框架（RAW-HF），用于优化原始数据查询，显著减少执行时间和资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据库管理系统（DBMS）和HTAP系统在查询前需加载整个数据集，而原位引擎可能多次重新解析数据，导致资源浪费。资源分配不当也会增加成本。

Method: RAW-HF通过模块化设计优化资源分配和工作负载执行，最大化现有资源利用率。

Result: 在SDSS和LOD数据集上，RAW-HF比PostgreSQL减少90%和85%的工作负载执行时间，资源利用率显著提升。

Conclusion: RAW-HF在减少执行时间和资源消耗方面优于现有技术，为高效数据查询提供了新方案。

Abstract: Scientific experiments and modern applications are generating large amounts
of data every day. Most organizations utilize In-house servers or Cloud
resources to manage application data and workload. The traditional database
management system (DBMS) and HTAP systems spend significant time & resources to
load the entire dataset into DBMS before starting query execution. On the other
hand, in-situ engines may reparse required data multiple times, increasing
resource utilization and data processing costs. Additionally, over or
under-allocation of resources also increases application running costs. This
paper proposes a lightweight Resource Availability &Workload aware Hybrid
Framework (RAW-HF) to optimize querying raw data by utilizing existing finite
resources efficiently. RAW-HF includes modules that help optimize the resources
required to execute a given workload and maximize the utilization of existing
resources. The impact of applying RAW-HF to real-world scientific dataset
workloads like Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Linked Observation Data
(LOD) presented over 90% and 85% reduction in workload execution time (WET)
compared to widely used traditional DBMS PostgreSQL. The overall CPU, IO
resource utilization, and WET have been reduced by 26%, 25%, and 26%,
respectively, while improving memory utilization by 33%, compared to the
state-of-the-art workload-aware partial loading technique (WA) proposed for
hybrid systems. A comparison of MUAR technique used by RAW-HF with machine
learning based resource allocation techniques like PCC is also presented.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的新型密度均衡映射框架（LDEM），通过神经网络实现更高精度和通用性，解决了传统方法在2D到3D扩展中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密度均衡映射方法存在精度低、极端情况下产生重叠伪影以及从2D扩展到3D时需重新设计算法的问题。

Method: 使用深度神经网络，引入损失函数确保密度均匀性和几何规则性，并采用分层方法预测粗粒度和密集级别的变换。

Result: LDEM在密度均衡性和双射性方面优于现有方法，且能无缝从2D扩展到3D，适用于多种密度分布和表面重网格化。

Conclusion: LDEM为密度均衡映射提供了可扩展且鲁棒的计算方法，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试衣方法依赖昂贵的机器人模型且无法准确模拟人体变形，合成服装与人体对齐效果不佳。

Method: 使用真实人体采集服装数据集，结合简化的DensePose图改进中间表示，实现服装与人体准确对齐。

Result: 在图像质量和时间一致性上优于现有方法，用户研究表明系统有助于服装购买决策。

Conclusion: 该方法降低了数据采集成本，提高了虚拟试衣的实用性和用户体验。

Abstract: Existing image-based virtual try-on methods are often limited to the front
view and lack real-time performance. While per-garment virtual try-on methods
have tackled these issues by capturing per-garment datasets and training
per-garment neural networks, they still encounter practical limitations: (1)
the robotic mannequin used to capture per-garment datasets is prohibitively
expensive for widespread adoption and fails to accurately replicate natural
human body deformation; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the
human body. To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach for
collecting per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the
necessity for a customized robotic mannequin. We also introduce a hybrid person
representation that enhances the existing intermediate representation with a
simplified DensePose map. This ensures accurate alignment of synthesized
garment images with the human body and enables human-garment interaction
without the need for customized wearable devices. We performed qualitative and
quantitative evaluations against other state-of-the-art image-based virtual
try-on methods and conducted ablation studies to demonstrate the superiority of
our method regarding image quality and temporal consistency. Finally, our user
study results indicated that most participants found our virtual try-on system
helpful for making garment purchasing decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D资产编辑中受限于预定义视角，缺乏灵活性和实用性，因此需要一种支持多视角一致性的编辑方法。

Method: Edit360基于视频扩散模型，通过锚点视图选择和编辑传播机制，在潜在和注意力空间中实现多视角信息对齐与合并。

Result: Edit360能够生成高质量的多视角序列，支持可定制的3D内容重建。

Conclusion: Edit360为3D资产的细粒度编辑提供了一种灵活且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image
generation and editing, but extending these capabilities to 3D assets remains
challenging, especially for fine-grained edits that require multi-view
consistency. Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined
viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications.
We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to
multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360
enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring
structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for
2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To
achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation
mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within
the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited
multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets,
enabling customizable 3D content creation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型动态校准方法，突破了惯性运动捕捉系统中IMU校准的绝对静态假设限制，显著扩展了应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IMU校准方法依赖绝对静态假设，限制了实际应用。本文旨在通过动态校准方法解决这一问题。

Method: 基于两个宽松假设（短时间窗口内矩阵变化可忽略、运动/读数多样性），利用Transformer模型学习矩阵映射，并设计校准触发器。

Result: 实现了实时估计RG'G和RBS，首次完成隐式IMU校准，支持稀疏IMU长期精准运动捕捉。

Conclusion: 该方法突破了传统限制，为稀疏IMU系统提供了更灵活、精准的动态校准方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic calibration method for sparse
inertial motion capture systems, which is the first to break the restrictive
absolute static assumption in IMU calibration, i.e., the coordinate drift RG'G
and measurement offset RBS remain constant during the entire motion, thereby
significantly expanding their application scenarios. Specifically, we achieve
real-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the
matrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU
readings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption
reduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides
diverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for
accurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in
real time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS
matrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based
model. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU
readings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To
our knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e.,
seamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration
process), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture
using sparse IMUs. The code and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新法西斯主义在西方国家迅速增长，对民主和少数群体构成威胁，需要采取行动防止其升级。研究旨在填补NLP与政治科学在此领域的空白。

Method: 收集新法西斯主义论坛（如Iron March和Stormfront.org）的大量帖子，通过众包标注1000条帖子，训练并测试小型和大型语言模型（SLMs和LLMs）。

Result: 研究发现新法西斯主义言论在论坛中普遍存在，成功开发了首个新法西斯主义话语分类模型，并强调了社会背景在NLP研究中的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁继续对抗新法西斯主义运动，以维护民主社会的福祉，同时强调研究仅针对文本内容而非个人或组织。

Abstract: Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having
remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as
well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and
the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid
escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme
for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political
science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to
test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the
internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and
Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected
posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are
labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we
fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models
(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist
discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of
forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The
societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting
NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be
pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.
Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,
similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or
organizations.

Motivation: 心脏亚结构在胸部放射治疗规划中至关重要，但现有深度学习方法在多模态和重叠结构分割上缺乏通用性。

Method: MAGIC通过nnU-Net的编码-解码分支实现，支持多模态数据（Sim-CT、MR-Linac、CCTA），并训练了12个对比模型进行验证。

Result: MAGIC在57%的案例中表现优于对比模型，平均DSC得分为0.75（Sim-CT）、0.68（MR-Linac）和0.80（CCTA）。

Conclusion: MAGIC提供了一种轻量级、高效的多模态分割解决方案，适用于临床环境。

Abstract: Cardiac substructures are essential in thoracic radiation therapy planning to
minimize risk of radiation-induced heart disease. Deep learning (DL) offers
efficient methods to reduce contouring burden but lacks generalizability across
different modalities and overlapping structures. This work introduces and
validates a Modality-AGnostic Image Cascade (MAGIC) for comprehensive and
multi-modal cardiac substructure segmentation. MAGIC is implemented through
replicated encoding and decoding branches of an nnU-Net-based, U-shaped
backbone conserving the function of a single model. Twenty cardiac
substructures (heart, chambers, great vessels (GVs), valves, coronary arteries
(CAs), and conduction nodes) from simulation CT (Sim-CT), low-field MR-Linac,
and cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) modalities were manually delineated and used
to train (n=76), validate (n=15), and test (n=30) MAGIC. Twelve comparison
models (four segmentation subgroups across three modalities) were equivalently
trained. All methods were compared for training efficiency and against
reference contours using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and two-tailed
Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test (threshold, p<0.05). Average DSC scores were
0.75(0.16) for Sim-CT, 0.68(0.21) for MR-Linac, and 0.80(0.16) for CCTA. MAGIC
outperforms the comparison in 57% of cases, with limited statistical
differences. MAGIC offers an effective and accurate segmentation solution that
is lightweight and capable of segmenting multiple modalities and overlapping
structures in a single model. MAGIC further enables clinical implementation by
simplifying the computational requirements and offering unparalleled
flexibility for clinical settings.

<details>

Motivation: 便携式鞋垫传感器成本低且易于使用，但噪声大、精度低；而传统跑步机测量GRF虽精确但不便携且昂贵。

Method: 采用时间感知知识蒸馏框架，利用小批量内的相似性和时序特征，捕捉目标与输入数据的互补关系和时序特性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在GRF估计上优于现有基线，轻量级模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 时间感知知识蒸馏框架为便携式GRF测量提供了一种高精度解决方案。

Abstract: Human gait analysis with wearable sensors has been widely used in various
applications, such as daily life healthcare, rehabilitation, physical therapy,
and clinical diagnostics and monitoring. In particular, ground reaction force
(GRF) provides critical information about how the body interacts with the
ground during locomotion. Although instrumented treadmills have been widely
used as the gold standard for measuring GRF during walking, their lack of
portability and high cost make them impractical for many applications. As an
alternative, low-cost, portable, wearable insole sensors have been utilized to
measure GRF; however, these sensors are susceptible to noise and disturbance
and are less accurate than treadmill measurements. To address these challenges,
we propose a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for GRF estimation
from insole sensor data. This framework leverages similarity and temporal
features within a mini-batch during the knowledge distillation process,
effectively capturing the complementary relationships between features and the
sequential properties of the target and input data. The performance of the
lightweight models distilled through this framework was evaluated by comparing
GRF estimations from insole sensor data against measurements from an
instrumented treadmill. Empirical results demonstrated that Time-aware
Knowledge Distillation outperforms current baselines in GRF estimation from
wearable sensor data.
