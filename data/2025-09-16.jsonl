Despite its widespread adoption, MPI's low-level\ninterface and lack of built-in type safety make it prone to runtime errors,\nundefined behavior, and debugging challenges, especially in large-scale\napplications. Rust, a modern systems programming language, offers a compelling\nsolution with its strong type system, which enforces memory and type safety at\ncompile time without compromising performance. This paper introduces a\ntype-safe communication framework for MPI, built on the RSMPI library, to\naddress the limitations of traditional MPI programming. At its core is the\nTypedCommunicator, an abstraction that enforces static type safety in\npoint-to-point communication operations. By leveraging Rust's Equivalence\ntrait, our framework guarantees that only compatible types can participate in\ncommunication, catching mismatches either at compile time or through runtime\nvalidation. The framework supports both single-value and slice-based\ncommunication, providing an intuitive API for diverse data structures.

Through comprehensive empirical evaluations, we\ndemonstrate that there exists a clear performance gap between smaller and\nlarger models, with the latter demonstrating stronger inference and surprising\ncapabilities in sample generation. Furthermore, our investigations reveal\nnotable limitations, including sensitivity to variations in the notation\nutilized to represent probabilistic outcomes and performance degradation of\nover 60% as context length increases. Together, our results provide a detailed\nunderstanding of the probabilistic reasoning abilities of LLMs and identify key\ndirections for future improvement."}

Recently, advanced and complex data processing has\ngained increasing importance in science experiments. Data processing workflows\ntypically consist of multiple intricate steps, and the precise specification of\nresource requirements is crucial for each step to allocate optimal resources\nfor effective processing. Estimating resource requirements in advance is\nchallenging due to a wide range of analysis scenarios, varying skill levels\namong community members, and the continuously increasing spectrum of computing\noptions. One practical approach to mitigate these challenges involves initially\nprocessing a subset of each step to measure precise resource utilization from\nactual processing profiles before completing the entire step.

The size of KV cache grows linearly as\nthe length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and\ndecoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize\nthe last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV\nimportance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it\ntends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect\nor omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By\nconcatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train\nthese tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that\nof the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the\nsoft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the\nimportance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining\ndecoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our\nmethod exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction\napproaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models\nsuch as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks\nincluding LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack.

However, state-of-the-art embedding models are typically based on LLMs,\nwhich contain billions of parameters, making deployment challenging in\nresource-constrained environments. Model compression through pruning offers a\npromising solution, but existing pruning methods treat all parameters\nuniformly, failing to distinguish between general semantic representations and\ndomain-specific patterns, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions. Thus, we\npropose GAPrune, a pruning framework that addresses this challenge by\nconsidering both domain importance and preserving general linguistic\nfoundation. Our method uses Fisher Information to measure importance and\ngeneral-domain gradient alignment to assess parameter behavior, then combines\nthese signals using our Domain Alignment Importance (DAI) scoring. Lower DAI\nscores indicate that the parameter is either less important for the domain task\nor creates conflicts between domain and general objectives. Experiments on two\ndomain benchmarks, FinMTEB and ChemTEB, show that GAPrune maintains performance\nwithin 2.5% of dense models in one-shot pruning at 50% sparsity, while\noutperforming all baselines.

Extensive experiments on Tanks\\&Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360\ndatasets demonstrate that, on average across the three datasets, the proposed\nSVR-GS reduces the number of Gaussians by 1.79\\(\\times\\) compared to MaskGS and\n5.63\\(\\times\\) compared to 3DGS, while incurring only 0.50 dB and 0.40 dB PSNR\ndrops, respectively. These gains translate into significantly smaller, faster,\nand more memory-efficient models, making them well-suited for real-time\napplications such as robotics, AR/VR, and mobile perception."}

The most common way of representing skin\ntone information is the Fitzpatrick Skin Tone (FST) scale.

This paper conducts an investigation of the impact\n(on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST\nscale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions\nusing FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when\ntraining models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and\n5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data\ncompared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the\ngranularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a\ndetrimental effect on performance.

However,\nRFID-based systems are prone to failure due to loss, damage, tampering, and\nvulnerability to external attacks. As a robust alternative, biometric\nidentification using cattle muzzle patterns similar to human fingerprints has\nemerged as a promising solution. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated\nsuccess in leveraging these unique patterns for accurate identification. But\ndeep learning models face significant challenges, including limited data\navailability, disruptions during data collection, and dynamic herd compositions\nthat require frequent model retraining. To address these limitations, this\npaper proposes a novel few-shot learning framework for real-time cattle\nidentification using Cooperative Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (CCoMAML) with\nMulti-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) as a feature extractor model. This\nmodel offers great model adaptability to new data through efficient learning\nfrom few data samples without retraining. The proposed approach has been\nrigorously evaluated against current state-of-the-art few-shot learning\ntechniques applied in cattle identification. Comprehensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed CCoMAML with MHAFF has superior cattle\nidentification performance with 98.46% and 97.91% F1 scores."}

In this work, we revisit hallucination\ndetection from the perspective of model architecture and generation dynamics.\nLeveraging the multi-layer structure and autoregressive decoding process of\nLLMs, we decompose hallucination signals into two complementary dimensions: the\nsemantic breadth of token representations within each layer, and the semantic\ndepth of core concepts as they evolve across layers.

We evaluate 19 MLLMs, including proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o,\nClaude-3.5-Sonnet) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL-2.5, Qwen2.5-VL).\nResults indicate that smaller models exhibit stronger stereotype biases,\nwhereas larger models align more closely with human preferences. Incorporating\nidentity information often exacerbates bias, particularly in emotional\njudgments. These findings underscore the importance of identity-aware\nevaluation frameworks in subjective vision-language tasks."}

This process starts with basic visual and multimodal\npre-training, followed by large-scale multiask trainging and instruction\ntuning. We also adopt multimodal data packaging and hybrid parallelism\ntechniques, which significantly improve end-to-end training speed. To further\nboost model performance, we specifically introduce test-time resolution search\nand model weight averaging. Notably, despite using about 1/10 of the training\ndata required by Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL\nin evaluations of general multimodal understanding and document/table\ncomprehension. Beyond overall scores, MindVL also delivers leading performance\nin OCR assessments."}

However, these two stages are optimized for\ndifferent objectives: semantic reconstruction during tokenizer pretraining\nversus user interaction modeling during recommender training. This objective\nmisalignment leads to two key limitations: (i) suboptimal static tokenization,\nwhere fixed token assignments fail to reflect diverse usage contexts; and (ii)\ndiscarded pretrained semantics, where pretrained knowledge - typically from\nlanguage model embeddings - is overwritten during recommender training on user\ninteractions. To address these limitations, we propose to learn DEcomposed\nCOntextual Token Representations (DECOR), a unified framework that preserves\npretrained semantics while enhancing the adaptability of token embeddings.\nDECOR introduces contextualized token composition to refine token embeddings\nbased on user interaction context, and decomposed embedding fusion that\nintegrates pretrained codebook embeddings with newly learned collaborative\nembeddings.

Extensive experiments on\nthe benchmark show that RSKT-Seg consistently outperforms strong OVS baselines\nby +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC, while achieving 2x faster inference through\nefficient aggregation.

Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on marine target\ndetection tasks tends to suffer from pronounced overfitting, particularly in\nchallenging low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) scenarios. This overfitting\nprimarily stems from the model's tendency to memorize spurious or noisy feature\npatterns rather than learning discriminative structures that generalize well to\nunseen data. To address this challenge, we introduce RadarLLM, a novel\nfine-tuning framework that utilizes an effective preference-aware loss.

Our key insight is to\nbridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit\ntraining paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and\nsmall-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.\nDuring inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic\nvideo-to-360{\\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment \"atlas\"\nrepresentation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world\nvideo. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all\nviewpoints, independent of body pose or motion.

In this paper,\nwe introduce LazyDrag, the first drag-based image editing method for\nMulti-Modal Diffusion Transformers, which directly eliminates the reliance on\nimplicit point matching. In concrete terms, our method generates an explicit\ncorrespondence map from user drag inputs as a reliable reference to boost the\nattention control.

However, when the target signal\nlacks low-frequency components and is dominated by broadband high frequencies,\ntraining suffers from a 'spectral bottleneck', and the model fails to\nreconstruct the entire signal, including the frequency components that lie\nwithin the network's representational capacity. We examine such a scenario in\nthe context of implicit neural representations (INRs) with sinusoidal\nrepresentation networks (SIRENs), focusing on the challenge of fitting\nhigh-frequency-dominant signals that are susceptible to spectral bottleneck. To\neffectively fit any target signal irrespective of it's frequency content, we\npropose a generalized target-aware 'weight perturbation scheme' (WINNER -\nweight initialization with noise for neural representations) for network\ninitialization. The scheme perturbs uniformly initialized weights with Gaussian\nnoise, where the noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral\ncentroid of the target signal. We show that the noise scales can provide\ncontrol over the spectra of network activations and the eigenbasis of the\nempirical neural tangent kernel. This method not only addresses the spectral\nbottleneck but also yields faster convergence and with improved representation\naccuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in audio fitting and\nachieving notable gains in image fitting and denoising tasks.

To address\nthis gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets\ndesigned to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities.\nPersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from\ndiverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes\nacross 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait\nassessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside\nfacial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two\ncomplementary levels.
