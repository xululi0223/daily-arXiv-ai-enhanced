However, their use as writing assistants in specialized\ndomains like finance, medicine, and law is often hampered by a lack of deep\ndomain-specific knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. Existing solutions,\nsuch as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can suffer from inconsistency\nacross multiple retrieval steps, while online search-based methods often\ndegrade quality due to unreliable web content. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DeepWriter, a customizable, multimodal, long-form writing assistant\nthat operates on a curated, offline knowledge base. DeepWriter leverages a\nnovel pipeline that involves task decomposition, outline generation, multimodal\nretrieval, and section-by-section composition with reflection. By deeply mining\ninformation from a structured corpus and incorporating both textual and visual\nelements, DeepWriter generates coherent, factually grounded, and\nprofessional-grade documents. We also propose a hierarchical knowledge\nrepresentation to enhance retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Our experiments on\nfinancial report generation demonstrate that DeepWriter produces high-quality,\nverifiable articles that surpasses existing baselines in factual accuracy and\ngenerated content quality."}

In DFQ, the quantization model must be\ncalibrated using synthetic samples, making the quality of these synthetic\nsamples crucial. Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global\nand local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data\nquality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant\ndifference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the\nquantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance\ndegradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a\npipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT).\nSpecifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty,\neffectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and\ninference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the\nquantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the\nfull-precision model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFQ-ViT achieves\nremarkable superiority over existing DFQ methods and its performance is on par\nwith models quantized through real data. For example, the performance of DeiT-T\nwith 3-bit weights quantization is 4.29% higher than the state-of-the-art.

Then, a deep learning-based classifier is trained\nto reliably assess registration quality, overcoming the limitations of\ntraditional metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to\naddress this task through a deep learning framework. We incorporate this\nclassifier into standard PCR pipelines. When integrated with our approach,\nexisting state-of-the-art PCR methods exhibit significantly enhanced\nregistration performance. For example, combining our framework with\nGeoTransformer achieves a new SOTA registration recall of 86.97\\% on the\nchallenging 3DLoMatch benchmark. Our method also demonstrates strong\ngeneralization capabilities on the unseen outdoor ETH dataset."}

Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer\nfrom two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality\nisolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations,\nwe propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that\nestablishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities,\nenabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge\nflows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early\nlayers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts\nthrough a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of\nlow-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific\ntask-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper\nalignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations\nat multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain\ntransferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further\nintroduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient\ncross-modal interactions.

Thus, it is natural for us to find a\nconnection between SSL and generative models to further enhance the\nrepresentation capacity of SSL. As generative models can create new samples by\napproximating the data distribution, such modeling should also lead to a\nsemantic understanding of the raw visual data, which is necessary for\nrecognition tasks.

Specifically, diffusion noise can be viewed as a particular state of\nmask that reveals a close relationship between masked image modeling (MIM) and\ndiffusion models. In this paper, we propose N-JEPA (Noise-based JEPA) to\nincorporate diffusion noise into MIM by the position embedding of masked\ntokens.

Current LLMs are built for adequately\nrepresenting a dataset, which is the most part of the accessible internet.\nHowever, the internet mostly contains non-scientific content.

Specifically, this issue manifests in two aspects:\ni) channels with high weights may not necessarily be effective, and ii)\nchannels with low weights may still hold significant value. To handle this\nproblem, we consider utilizing the inter-channel correlation to facilitate the\nnovel model's adaptation process to novel conditions, ensuring the model can\ncorrectly highlight effective channels and rectify those incorrect ones. Since\nthe channel sequence is also 1-dimensional, its similarity with the temporal\nsequence inspires us to take Mamba for modeling the correlation in the channel\nsequence. Based on this concept, we propose a Spatial-Channel State Space\nModeling (SCSM) module for spatial-channel state modeling, which highlights the\neffective patterns and rectifies those ineffective ones in feature channels. In\nSCSM, we design the Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM) module to balance the\nlearning of spatial relationships and channel relationships, and then introduce\nthe Channel State Modeling (CSM) module based on Mamba to learn correlation in\nchannels.

This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel.

Through extensive real-world experiments, we show GR-3 surpasses the\nstate-of-the-art baseline method, $\\pi_0$, on a wide variety of challenging\ntasks. We hope GR-3 can serve as a step towards building generalist robots\ncapable of assisting humans in daily life."}

Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning\nand code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their\nadvantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal\ndata type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in\ncomplex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain\nvision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex\nchart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic\ndata synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning\ndata covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of\nreasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training\nstrategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and\nChart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims\nto decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable\nsubtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for\nimproving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the\ntypical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft\nreward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity\nin the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks\nand self-built chart reasoning dataset (\\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}). Experimental\nresults show that Chart-R1 has significant advantages compared to chart-domain\nmethods, even comparable to open/closed source large-scale models (\\emph{e.g.,\nGPT-4o, Claude-3.5})."}

The\napplication to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the\ndiscrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry\nconstraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us\nto link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity\ntransformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the\ncomputational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the\ndiscrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete\nrepresentation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal\nloss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and\nenforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based\nconsistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher\nrelighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding\ncomplex manually designed optimization.

We build on recent advances in foveated image\nprocessing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both\nhuman head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA\nrobot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously\ncollecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as\nwell as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that\nincorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nin robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated\npatch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation.\nCompared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number\nof tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions\nof interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction\nfrom human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide\nfoveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space,\nallowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results\nshow that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces\ncomputational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks\nand robustness to unseen distractors.
