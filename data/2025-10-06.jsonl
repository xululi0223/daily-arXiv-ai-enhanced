We establish the circumstances under which\ncombining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.\nUsing data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the\nbenefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of\ncollaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between\ncollaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule\npredicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline\nabilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using\nthe PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate\nthan the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was\nsurprisingly large. We implemented \"intelligent human-machine fusion\" by\nselecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a\nhigh-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine\noperating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine\njudgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only\npartnerships was found by graph theory.

We evaluate\nHGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,\nachieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for\npatch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor\ncategories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on\nslide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images\nfrom the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging\nmodalities."}

Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely\non uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to\nincorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches\nimpose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window\nsuppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at\nlimiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near\nimportant events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect\nquery relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module\nfor query-driven long-form video understanding.

To handle broad queries with weak\nalignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating\nmechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method\nseamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without\nadditional supervision.

Speculative decoding addresses this by\nemploying a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified\nin parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR\ndrafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the\ndrafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that\nuses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts\nin a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR\nverifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning,\nparallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally\nhighest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right\npath. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a\nspeed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two\npractical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this\nlattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and\n(ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size\nbased on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length.

GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the\ndiffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,\nand applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference\ncues.

To address this, we propose\nSelf-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time\nframework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token\ngeneration, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify\nhigh-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific\ncorrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a\nself-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution.

Unlike conventional methods where the color\ntransformation is restricted to pre-defined color spaces like RGB, our method\ndynamically adapts to input content by transforming RGB colors into a\nhigh-dimensional feature space referred to as \\textit{pigments}. The proposed\npigment representation offers adaptability and expressiveness, achieving\nsuperior image enhancement performance. The proposed method involves\ntransforming input RGB colors into high-dimensional pigments, which are then\nreprojected individually and blended to refine and aggregate the information of\nthe colors in pigment spaces.

The transformation and\nreprojection parameters are derived from the visual encoder which adaptively\nestimates such parameters based on the content in the input image.

This paper presents a comparative study of\nadversarial robustness, first by quantifying the limitations of standard\nadversarial training and then by introducing a novel, significantly more\nresilient detection framework: Perturbation-Invariant Feature Engineering\n(PIFE), a framework that enhances detection by first transforming input text\ninto a standardized form using a multi-stage normalization pipeline, it then\nquantifies the transformation's magnitude using metrics like Levenshtein\ndistance and semantic similarity, feeding these signals directly to the\nclassifier. We evaluate both a conventionally hardened Transformer and our\nPIFE-augmented model against a hierarchical taxonomy of character-, word-, and\nsentence-level attacks. Our findings first confirm that conventional\nadversarial training, while resilient to syntactic noise, fails against\nsemantic attacks, an effect we term \"semantic evasion threshold\", where its\nTrue Positive Rate at a strict 1% False Positive Rate plummets to 48.8%.

We argue that code communicates\nthrough two channels: structural semantics, which define formal behavior, and\nhuman-interpretable naming, which conveys intent. Removing the naming channel\nseverely degrades intent-level tasks such as summarization, where models\nregress to line-by-line descriptions. Surprisingly, we also observe consistent\nreductions on execution tasks that should depend only on structure, revealing\nthat current benchmarks reward memorization of naming patterns rather than\ngenuine semantic reasoning. To disentangle these effects, we introduce a suite\nof semantics-preserving obfuscations and show that they expose identifier\nleakage across both summarization and execution. Building on these insights, we\nrelease ClassEval-Obf, an obfuscation-enhanced benchmark that systematically\nsuppresses naming cues while preserving behavior. Our results demonstrate that\nClassEval-Obf reduces inflated performance gaps, weakens memorization\nshortcuts, and provides a more reliable basis for assessing LLMs' code\nunderstanding and generalization."}

In contrast, Planning\nDomain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal\nplanning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these\ncomplementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into\nPDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem\nfiles satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain\nfiles, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely\non human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access\nfor refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can\nautonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual\nplanning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A\nSimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and\na GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the\nPDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of\ngeneralizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the\ndifferent instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different\nproblems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world\ndomains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game\nrules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios,\nsimulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal\nreaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of\nSimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for\nunseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively.

While there are some theoretical and primary\nempirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped\ntransformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models\ntypically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue\nthat diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete\nspace. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger\nexpressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the\ncontradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance\nto their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides\nintermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce\nadditional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the\ncontinuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous\nDiscrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process\non the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,\nleveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By\ncombining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent\nspace, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of\nexplicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced\ntraining/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical\nperformance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks."}

Previous methods typically address this by\nmaintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern\nmeaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that\nan unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and\ndestabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within\nRLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable\nlow-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \\textbf{\\textit{reasoning\nsparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are\nsystematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a\ndegeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability\nRegularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a\nheuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out\npresumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining\ncandidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of\n\\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft\nregularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL\ndivergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for\naround 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.\nThis sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a\n$60.17\\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\\%$\nover prior methods.
