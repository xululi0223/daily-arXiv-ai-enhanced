Reference models,\ncritical for accelerating the verification process, are themselves becoming\nmore intricate and time-consuming to develop. Despite the promise shown by\nlarge language models (LLMs) in code programming, effectively generating\ncomplex reference models remains a significant hurdle. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce ChatModel, the first LLM-aided agile reference model\ngeneration and verification platform. ChatModel streamlines the transition from\ndesign specifications to fully functional reference models by integrating\ndesign standardization and hierarchical agile modeling. Employing a\nbuilding-block generation strategy, it not only enhances the design\ncapabilities of LLMs for reference models but also significantly boosts\nverification efficiency. We evaluated ChatModel on 300 designs of varying\ncomplexity, demonstrating substantial improvements in both efficiency and\nquality of reference model generation.

While static weights\nare constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV\ncaches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for\nefficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle\nruntime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory\nmanagement relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a\npage table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction.\nThis virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory\nfragmentation.

Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained\nattention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained\nattention at higher layers models object-level topology.

The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use\ncheckpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an\nadditional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield\nsignificant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases\nand scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose,\nCheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by\na weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state\nof the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However,\nbecause of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover\nfailures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+\nwith out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last\nstages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is\nmimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by\nsimply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover\nthe (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring\nstages, which requires relatively small storage overhead.

Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba\narchitecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating\nstrong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify\nthree mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is\nsupported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state\nspace block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally\nlinked to primacy effects.

Third, we find that\nmemory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated\nrelations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the\ntendency to forget intermediate items.

Under review for NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an\nAI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for\naccurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)\nfor 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The\naim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D\nreconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each\ncandidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural\nuncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,\nnamed UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a\npredicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible\ncandidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many\nnatural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to\nlearn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the\nunderlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all\npreviously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate\nviewpoints and effectively select the most informative one.

Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion\nreconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower\nreconstruction errors than non-member images.

While deep\nlearning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet\ntagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer\n(ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information,\nremains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially\nunder realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a\nsystematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet\nclassification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data.

However, text extraction from\nhistorical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)\ntraining data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific\nmap styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene\nimages) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their\nflexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these\nmethods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting\nevery sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This\nis critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex\nbackgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a\nrough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for\nscanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel\nhyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around\nthe target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and\nrecognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn\nspatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across\ntext instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to\nautomatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text\nspotters for historical maps.

First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that\nuses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of\nthe style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove\nstyle-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.\nThis gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free\ninjection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy\nbased on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in\nthe fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive\nlearning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a\ntraining-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which\nmanipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the\ncross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and\nvalue of the content-related process are replaced with those of the\nstyle-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the\nmodel. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the\noriginal content.

A key challenge\nis achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like\ntranslation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces\nTargeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.\nWe first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits\nstrong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its\nearly internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine\nsimilarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its\nfinal output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).\nTLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a\ncontrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting\nembeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our\nexperiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical\nalignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine\nsimilarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More\nimportantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control\nword pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17\nx 10^-27).

Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in\nechocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments.\nHowever, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and\nambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To\naddress these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise\ndiffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a\nunique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a\nmulti-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision.\nFurthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial\nintegrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously\nvalidated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It\nachieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively.\nThe proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram\nsegmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in\nother medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across\nvarious medical domains.

Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful\nbalance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused\nimages effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the\nfunctional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited\ncapacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer\nfrom insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused\nimage quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage\ndiffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In\nStage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet\ncaptures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents\nmultilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the\nsubsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input\ninto the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.\nThree key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from\ndifferent modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a\nhybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,\ncolor, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density.

However, the crucial choice of window size presents a\nPareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but\noffer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller\nwindows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and\nMistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining\nlength) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift\nthis Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains\neven in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic\nlimitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the\ndefined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated\nwith a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information\nfrom these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B\nscales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between\nperformance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of\njust 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across\ndiverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear\nattention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context\nperformance, as validated on the RULER benchmark.

Our study highlights the importance of\nimproving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future\nadvancements in gender fairness in generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u516c\u5e73\u6307\u6570\uff08GIFI\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8c\u5143\u548c\u975e\u4e8c\u5143\u6027\u522b\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8c\u5143\u6027\u522b\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u975e\u4e8c\u5143\u6027\u522b\u7684\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7GIFI\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\uff08\u5982\u4ee3\u8bcd\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\uff09\u8bc4\u4f3022\u79cdLLMs\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540cLLMs\u5728\u6027\u522b\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u6027\u522b\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6027\u522b\u516c\u5e73\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Current approaches typically\nmerge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing\nphenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and\ndegraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new\ntask, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our\ndataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised\nmulti-sentence caption-graph pairs for images.

We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for\nextracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based\nrewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning\nmodel to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the\nreasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified\nrule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers\nto compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as\nan auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy\noptimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\\%\nrelative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a\n6.1\\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,\ncompared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but\nwithout the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the\nextracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference.

In\nthis work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of\ndense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect\nmeaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend\nto form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual\nstream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense\nfeatures in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an\nintrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense\nlatents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,\nentropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and\nprincipal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features\nevolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early\nlayers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented\nsignals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense\nlatents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be\ndismissed as training noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u975e\u8bad\u7ec3\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5177\u6709\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76SAE\u4e2d\u5bc6\u96c6\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u4ea7\u7269\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5bc6\u96c6\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u7c7b\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5404\u5c42\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5bc6\u96c6\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5f62\u6210\u53cd\u6781\u5bf9\uff0c\u91cd\u6784\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u5982\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bc6\u96c6\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e0d\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u566a\u58f0\u3002"}}

Three training\nstrategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed\ncohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna.

We\nbuilt FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and\nfine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge)\nand survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).\n  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on\n749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of\ncancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting)\nand independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were\nclinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival\nanalyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic\nfactors.\n  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error\nof 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining\naccuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge\noutperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication.\nFAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the\nhighest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest\n(adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the\nindependent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex,\nrace and cancer subgroups.

ACM Softw. Eng. 2, FSE", "summary": "Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation,\ndata analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of\ntheir accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect\nvisualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information\nconveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual\nbugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause\nobvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data\ngraphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good\nunderstanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is\nessential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz\nlibraries.\n  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz\nlibraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our\nstudy systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a\ndetailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in\nDataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause,\nwhich necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries.\nMoreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test\noracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in\ndesigning effective automated testing techniques.

Recently, a variant of IL, called\nIn-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant\npolicies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform\na new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale\ndemonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined\nby hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally\ngenerates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To\nalleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning\nalgorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's\nt-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of\ninstant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP\ngenerates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an\nLLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial\nfor ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory\nagainst hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both\nsimulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\\%$ improvement in task success\nrates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning\nbaselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,\nNabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting\nwithin a few finetuning steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "Nabla-R2D3\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u53163D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc72D\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d3D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9075\u5faa\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u7eb9\u7406\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eNabla-GFlowNet\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5339\u914d\u5956\u52b1\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5956\u52b1\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5229\u75282D\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u8c03\u65743D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNabla-R2D3\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u6b65\u9aa4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Nabla-R2D3\u4e3a3D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}
