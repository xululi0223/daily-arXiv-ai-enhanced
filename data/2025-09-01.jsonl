To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of\ncounterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which\nsimultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and\nenhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias\nAugmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:\nfirst decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively\nmodifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the\ntext from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that\nmitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that\nCoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively\nreduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a\nversatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations."}

The centralized paradigm relies on a central server to\naggregate local models, potentially resulting in single points of failure,\ncommunication bottlenecks, and exposure of model parameters. In contrast, the\ndecentralized paradigm, which does not require a central server, provides\nimproved robustness and privacy. The essence of federated learning lies in\nleveraging multiple local updates for efficient communication. However, this\napproach may result in slower convergence or even convergence to suboptimal\nmodels in the presence of heterogeneous and imbalanced data. To address this\nchallenge, we study decentralized federated averaging via random walk (DFedRW),\nwhich replaces multiple local update steps on a single device with random walk\nupdates.

Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the\nnormal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense\nof the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two\nways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather\nthan exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test\nrequires building machines that \"make mistakes\" and display imperfect behavior\njust like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a\nstatistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a\nsingle \"average\" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As\nsuch, the notion of \"average human interrogator\" that Turing talks about in his\noriginal paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical\nabstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of\nmultiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of\nnormal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average\njudgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,\nit argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the\nTuring test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than\nnormal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it\nproposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per\nse. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can\ncontribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether\nthe human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which\nlargely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual\nunderpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to."}

The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a\nCLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,\nand finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation\nwas conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical\nimage chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It\nshowed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to\nexhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =\n100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results\ndemonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling\nyields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking."}

This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary\nregularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of\nindividual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first\nstrategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent\nstudies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages\nextreme anisotropy-specifically, \"needle-like\" shapes-by favoring more\nbalanced, \"disk-like\" forms that are better suited for stable surface\nreconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance\nFunction (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an\nEikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous\nglobal surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the\nunderlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity\nof individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The\nfinal model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data."}

We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively\ndistinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large\ndistribution shifts (Far-OOD).

Rural livability is a key indicator for\nmeasuring the effectiveness of these efforts. Current measurement approaches\nface significant limitations, as questionnaire-based methods are difficult to\nscale, while urban-oriented visual perception methods are poorly suited for\nrural contexts. In this paper, a rural-specific livability assessment framework\nwas proposed based on drone imagery and multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs). To comprehensively assess village livability, this study first used a\ntop-down approach to collect large-scale drone imagery of 1,766 villages in 146\ncounties across China. In terms of the model framework, an efficient image\ncomparison mechanism was developed, incorporating binary search interpolation\nto determine effective image pairs while reducing comparison iterations.\nBuilding on expert knowledge, a chain-of-thought prompting suitable for\nnationwide rural livability measurement was constructed, considering both\nliving quality and ecological habitability dimensions. This approach enhanced\nthe rationality and reliability of the livability assessment. Finally, this\nstudy characterized the spatial heterogeneity of rural livability across China\nand thoroughly analyzed its influential factors. The results show that: (1) The\nrural livability in China demonstrates a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern,\nradiating outward from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces with declining gradients;\n(2) Among various influential factors, government fiscal expenditure emerged as\nthe core determinant, with each unit increase corresponding to a 3.9 - 4.9 unit\nenhancement in livability.

We classify it in two key dimensions: source\nheterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and\nuser heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across\nindividuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific\ninformation, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their\nreal-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns\nlatent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream\npredictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.\nSpecifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source\nheterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user\nheterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term\nphysiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a\ndiscriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of\nreal-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,\nParroTao.
