Even with today's high-speed storage, the prevailing view is that\nachieving sub-millisecond cold starts requires keeping state resident in\nmemory.\n  This paper challenges that assumption. Our analysis of existing\nsnapshot/restore mechanisms show that OS-level limitations, not storage speed,\nare the real barrier to ultra-fast restores from disk. These limitations force\ncurrent systems to either restore state piecemeal in a costly manner or capture\ntoo much state, leading to longer restore times and unpredictable performance.\nFuthermore, current memory primitives exposed by the OS make it difficult to\nreliably fetch data into memory and avoid costly runtime page faults.\n  To overcome these barriers, we present Spice, an execution engine\npurpose-built for serverless snapshot/restore. Spice integrates directly with\nthe OS to restore kernel state without costly replay and introduces dedicated\nprimitives for restoring memory mappings efficiently and reliably. As a result,\nSpice delivers near-warm performance on cold restores from disk, reducing\nlatency by up to 14.9x over state-of-the-art process-based systems and 10.6x\nover VM-based systems.

Several\nrecent studies indicate that adapting precision levels across different\nparameters can maintain accuracy comparable to full-precision models while\nsignificantly reducing computational demands. However, existing embedded\nmicroprocessors lack sufficient architectural support for efficiently executing\nmixed-precision NNs, both in terms of ISA extensions and hardware design,\nresulting in inefficiencies such as excessive data packing/unpacking and\nunderutilized arithmetic units. In this work, we propose novel ISA extensions\nand a micro-architecture implementation specifically designed to optimize\nmixed-precision execution, enabling energy-efficient deep learning inference on\nRISC-V architectures. We introduce MaRVIn, a cross-layer hardware-software\nco-design framework that enhances power efficiency and performance through a\ncombination of hardware improvements, mixed-precision quantization, ISA-level\noptimizations, and cycle-accurate emulation. At the hardware level, we enhance\nthe ALU with configurable mixed-precision arithmetic (2, 4, 8 bits) for\nweights/activations and employ multi-pumping to reduce execution latency while\nimplementing soft SIMD for efficient 2-bit ops. At the software level, we\nintegrate a pruning-aware fine-tuning method to optimize model compression and\na greedy-based DSE approach to efficiently search for Pareto-optimal\nmixed-quantized models. Additionally, we incorporate voltage scaling to boost\nthe power efficiency of our system. Our experimental evaluation over widely\nused DNNs and datasets, such as CIFAR10 and ImageNet, demonstrates that our\nframework can achieve, on average, 17.6x speedup for less than 1% accuracy loss\nand outperforms the ISA-agnostic state-of-the-art RISC-V cores, delivering up\nto 1.8 TOPs/W."}

LLMs tend to\ngenerate hallucinations, a seemingly plausible yet factually unsupported output\n[Hua+24], which have serious real-world consequences [Kay23; Rum+24]. Recent\nwork has shown that probing-based classifiers that utilize LLMs' internal\nrepresentations can detect hallucinations [AM23; Bei+24; Bur+24; DYT24; Ji+24;\nSMZ24; Su+24]. This approach, since it does not involve model training, can\nenhance reliability without significantly increasing computational costs.\n  Building upon this approach, this thesis proposed novel methods for\nhallucination detection using LLM internal representations and evaluated them\nacross three benchmarks: TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and ReFact. Specifically, a new\narchitecture that dynamically weights and combines internal LLM layers was\ndeveloped to improve hallucination detection performance. Throughout extensive\nexperiments, two key findings were obtained: First, the proposed approach was\nshown to achieve superior performance compared to traditional probing methods,\nthough generalization across benchmarks and LLMs remains challenging. Second,\nthese generalization limitations were demonstrated to be mitigated through\ncross-benchmark training and parameter freezing. While not consistently\nimproving, both techniques yielded better performance on individual benchmarks\nand reduced performance degradation when transferred to other benchmarks.

It is not clear\nhow to efficiently arrange the iterative denoising processes to deal with\ndifferent levels or patterns of noise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive\nand iterative point cloud denoising method based on the score-based diffusion\nmodel.

Overall, the present study represents the synthesis of 140\npublications on different types of toxic content on digital platforms. We\npresent a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in previous studies\nfocusing on definitions, data sources, challenges, and machine learning\napproaches employed in detecting online toxicity, such as hate speech,\noffensive language, and harmful discourse. The dataset encompasses content in\n32 languages, covering topics such as elections, spontaneous events, and\ncrises. We examine the possibility of using existing cross-platform data to\nimprove the performance of classification models. We present the\nrecommendations and guidelines for new research on online toxic consent and the\nuse of content moderation for mitigation. Finally, we present some practical\nguidelines to mitigate toxic content from online platforms."}

In particular, we first extract\nhigh-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then\nfine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution\nand synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less\ntraining data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we\ntrain a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\\% of the original\ndataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model\nfine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much\nshorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset."}

Personal style is often\nsubtle and implicit, making it difficult to specify through prompts yet\nessential for user-aligned generation. This work presents a comprehensive\nevaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs' ability to mimic personal writing styles\nvia in-context learning from a small number of user-authored samples. We\nintroduce an ensemble of complementary metrics-including authorship\nattribution, authorship verification, style matching, and AI detection-to\nrobustly assess style imitation. Our evaluation spans over 40000 generations\nper model across domains such as news, email, forums, and blogs, covering\nwriting samples from more than 400 real-world authors. Results show that while\nLLMs can approximate user styles in structured formats like news and email,\nthey struggle with nuanced, informal writing in blogs and forums.

The\nmodel employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture trained on data spanning\nseven anatomical regions. This design enables the model to perform multiple\ntasks, including ultrasound report generation, diagnosis and visual\nquestion-answering (VQA). The experimental results demonstrated that EchoVLM\nachieved significant improvements of 10.15 and 4.77 points in BLEU-1 scores and\nROUGE-1 scores respectively compared to Qwen2-VL on the ultrasound report\ngeneration task. These findings suggest that EchoVLM has substantial potential\nto enhance diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging, thereby providing a\nviable technical solution for future clinical applications.

The\nresults demonstrate that fine-tuning LLM models with LoRA (low-rank adaptation)\nimproves their performance in extracting information from implicit texts,\ncontributing to better model interpretability and reliability."}

To overcome the aforementioned issues, we deliver a\nnovel one-step multi-view clustering method with adaptive low-rank anchor-graph\nlearning (OMCAL). To construct a high-quality CAG, OMCAL provides a nuclear\nnorm-based adaptive CAG learning model against information redundancy and noise\ninterference.

Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages\noptical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space\nand selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels.\nDual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths\nto adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural\nsignals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned\nguidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and\nphotorealistic content generation. Extensive experiments across diverse\nbenchmarks validate our method's superiority in realism, trajectory\nconsistency, and visual fidelity. This work introduces a novel plug-and-play\nparadigm for controllable video synthesis, offering a new perspective on\nleveraging generative priors for spatial intelligence."}

Existing\nlabel-free methods, confidence minimization, self-consistency, or majority-vote\nobjectives, stabilize learning but steadily shrink exploration, causing an\nentropy collapse: generations become shorter, less diverse, and brittle. Unlike\nprior approaches such as Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which\nprimarily adapt models to the immediate unlabeled dataset at hand, our goal is\nbroader: to enable general improvements without sacrificing the model's\ninherent exploration capacity and generalization ability, i.e., evolving. We\nformalize this issue and propose EVolution-Oriented and Label-free\nReinforcement Learning (EVOL-RL), a simple rule that couples stability with\nvariation under a label-free setting. EVOL-RL keeps the majority-voted answer\nas a stable anchor (selection) while adding a novelty-aware reward that favors\nresponses whose reasoning differs from what has already been produced\n(variation), measured in semantic space. Implemented with GRPO, EVOL-RL also\nuses asymmetric clipping to preserve strong signals and an entropy regularizer\nto sustain search. This majority-for-selection + novelty-for-variation design\nprevents collapse, maintains longer and more informative chains of thought, and\nimproves both pass@1 and pass@n. EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the\nmajority-only TTRL baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts\nQwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from TTRL's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5%\nto 37.9%. EVOL-RL not only prevents diversity collapse but also unlocks\nstronger generalization across domains (e.g., GPQA). Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that EVOL-RL also boosts performance in the RLVR setting,\nhighlighting its broad applicability."}

Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods\n(\\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while\nneglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In\ncontrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution\nusing a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL\ndivergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this\nidea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration\nand generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and\ncode reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of\n$10.0\\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs\nconsistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward\ndistribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse\nreasoning in LLM reinforcement learning."}
