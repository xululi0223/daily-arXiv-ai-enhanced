To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ndedicated and comprehensive survey on EdgeSNNs, providing an essential\nreference for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of\nneuromorphic computing and edge intelligence."}

We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies\nand find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step\nbefore the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's\noriginal performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on\nscene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning\naccuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune\nmodels using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and\nevaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates\nsuperior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions.

The lack of dedicated CS datasets limits ASR performance, as most\nmodels rely on monolingual or mixed-language corpora that fail to reflect\nreal-world CS patterns. This issue is critical in multilingual societies where\nCS occurs in informal and formal settings. A key example is Catalan-Spanish CS,\nwidely used in media and parliamentary speeches. In this work, we improve ASR\nfor Catalan-Spanish CS by exploring three strategies: (1) generating synthetic\nCS data, (2) concatenating monolingual audio, and (3) leveraging real CS data\nwith language tokens. We extract CS data from Catalan speech corpora and\nfine-tune OpenAI's Whisper models, making them available on Hugging Face.\nResults show that combining a modest amount of synthetic CS data with the\ndominant language token yields the best transcription performance."}

In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based\nframework, dubbed \\ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying\ntexture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \\ours performs DM to generate\nthe prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images.

Image restoration\nhas emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed\nin the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made\nremarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity\nposes significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in\nreal-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to\nsimplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or\nstate space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network\narchitecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration\nitself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative\npipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image\nrestoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient\nrestoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).\nSpecifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block\nlevel, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to\nachieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the\nintra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative\nto self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity\nwhile preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks\nsuch as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion\ndeblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light\nenhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art\nmethods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with\nsignificantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time."}

Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction\nstrategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and\nstructural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and\nocclusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our\nobservation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than\nrigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the\nreconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the\nregion-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking\nguidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions\nthan to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the\nlatter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire\nfingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world\ninteractions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained\nencoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven\nmultimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the\nlearned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and\nobjects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of\nmonocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues.

However, these degradation kernels, which model the\ntransition from a high-resolution (HR) image to its LR version, should account\nfor not only the degradation process but also the downscaling factor. Applying\nthe same degradation kernel across varying super-resolution scales may be\nimpractical. Our research acknowledges degradation kernels and scaling factors\nas pivotal elements for the BSR task and introduces a novel strategy that\nutilizes HR images as references to establish scale-aware degradation kernels.\nBy employing content-irrelevant HR reference images alongside the target LR\nimage, our model adaptively discerns the degradation process.
