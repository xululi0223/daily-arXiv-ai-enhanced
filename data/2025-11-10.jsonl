In\nthis work, we study the task of reconstructing globally ordered sequences from\nshuffled procedural steps, using a curated dataset of food recipes, a domain\nwhere correct sequencing is essential for task success. We evaluate several\nLLMs under zero-shot and few-shot settings and present a comprehensive\nevaluation framework that adapts established metrics from ranking and sequence\nalignment. These include Kendall's Tau, Normalized Longest Common Subsequence\n(NLCS), and Normalized Edit Distance (NED), which capture complementary aspects\nof ordering quality. Our analysis shows that model performance declines with\nincreasing sequence length, reflecting the added complexity of longer\nprocedures. We also find that greater step displacement in the input,\ncorresponding to more severe shuffling, leads to further degradation.

Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where\nhigher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the\nreliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction\nhierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first\n\"think\" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority\n(system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability\nvia training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of\nconstraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both\naligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight\nreinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning\ncapabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models\nachieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction\nhierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to\nsafety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety\nissues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined\nhigher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against\njailbreak and prompt injection attacks.

In this paper, we propose SMART-WRITE, a method that\nintegrates neural networks (NN) and reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically\noptimize write energy and improve performance. The NN model monitors real-time\noperating conditions and device characteristics to determine optimal write\nparameters, while the RL model dynamically adjusts these parameters to further\noptimize PCM's energy consumption. By continuously adjusting PCM write\nparameters based on real-time system conditions, SMART-WRITE reduces write\nenergy consumption by up to 63% and improves performance by up to 51% compared\nto the baseline and previous models."}

We\nintroduce Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN), a novel decoder\narchitecture designed to address this limitation.

Congestion is serious threat that\nspoils the interconnection network performance, and its effects are even more\ndramatic when looking at the traffic dynamics and bottlenecks generated by the\ncommunication operations mentioned above. In this vein, numerous congestion\ncontrol (CC) techniques have been developed to address congestion negative\neffects. One popular example is Data Center Quantized Congestion Notification\n(DCQCN), which allows congestion detection at network switch buffers, then\nmarking congesting packets and notifying about congestion to the sources, which\nfinally apply injection throttling of those packets contributing to congestion.\nWhile DCQCN has been widely studied and improved, its main principles for\ncongestion detection, notification and reaction remain largely unchanged, which\nis an important shortcoming considering congestion dynamics in current\nhigh-performance interconnection networks. In this paper, we revisit the DCQCN\nclosed-loop mechanism and refine its design to leverage a more accurate\ncongestion detection, signaling, and injection throttling, reducing control\ntraffic overhead and avoiding unnecessary throttling of non-congesting flows."}

To address this fundamental tension, we\npropose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that\nredefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from\nalignment.

Current methods, such as Path Patching, are computationally\nexpensive and have limited in-depth circuit analysis for smaller models. In\nthis study, we propose Accelerated Path Patching (APP), a hybrid approach\nleveraging our novel contrastive attention head pruning method to drastically\nreduce the search space of circuit discovery methods. Our Contrastive-FLAP\npruning algorithm uses techniques from causal mediation analysis to assign\nhigher pruning scores to task-specific attention heads, leading to higher\nperforming sparse models compared to traditional pruning techniques. Although\nContrastive-FLAP is successful at preserving task-specific heads that existing\npruning algorithms remove at low sparsity ratios, the circuits found by\nContrastive-FLAP alone are too large to satisfy the minimality constraint\nrequired in circuit analysis. APP first applies Contrastive-FLAP to reduce the\nsearch space on required for circuit discovery algorithms by, on average, 56\\%.\nNext, APP, applies traditional Path Patching on the remaining attention heads,\nleading to a speed up of 59.63\\%-93.27\\% compared to Path Patching applied to\nthe dense model. Despite the substantial computational saving that APP\nprovides, circuits obtained from APP exhibit substantial overlap and similar\nperformance to previously established Path Patching circuits"}

Experiments\non the CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements. Our\nmethod achieves a Recall@10 of 93.21 and an Rmean of 84.43 on CIRR, and an\naverage Rmean of 67.48 on FashionIQ, surpassing recent strong baselines by up\nto 4.5%. These results confirm that dynamic multi-model collaboration provides\nan effective and general solution for CIR."}

However, their widespread adoption has heightened\nconcerns regarding vulnerability to adversarial attacks. With emerging\nregulations and standards emphasizing security, organizations must reliably\nquantify risks associated with these attacks, particularly regarding\ntransferred adversarial attacks, which remain challenging to evaluate\naccurately. This paper investigates the complexities involved in resilience\ntesting against transferred adversarial attacks. Our analysis specifically\naddresses black-box evasion attacks, highlighting transfer-based attacks due to\ntheir practical significance and typically high transferability between neural\nnetwork models. We underline the computational infeasibility of exhaustively\nexploring high-dimensional input spaces to achieve complete test coverage. As a\nresult, comprehensive adversarial risk mapping is deemed impractical. To\nmitigate this limitation, we propose a targeted resilience testing framework\nthat employs surrogate models strategically selected based on Centered Kernel\nAlignment (CKA) similarity. By leveraging surrogate models exhibiting both high\nand low CKA similarities relative to the target model, the proposed approach\nseeks to optimize coverage of adversarial subspaces. Risk estimation is\nconducted using regression-based estimators, providing organizations with\nrealistic and actionable risk quantification."}

Digitised whole-slide images (WSIs) capture rich spatial and\nmorphological information vital for understanding disease biology, yet their\ngigapixel scale and variability pose major challenges for standardisation and\nanalysis. Robust preprocessing, covering tissue detection, tessellation, stain\nnormalisation, and annotation parsing is critical but often limited by\nfragmented and inconsistent workflows. We present PySlyde, a lightweight,\nopen-source Python toolkit built on OpenSlide to simplify and standardise WSI\npreprocessing.

Here, the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$\ndepend only on the regularities of the data and velocity fields.
