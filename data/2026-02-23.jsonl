This system, assembled at the UC San Diego Supercomputer Center, comprises a co-designed hard- and software stack that is optimized for run-time massively parallel processing and hierarchical address-event routing (HiAER) of spikes while promoting memory-efficient network storage and execution. The architecture efficiently handles both sparse connectivity and sparse activity for robust and low-latency event-driven inference for both edge and cloud computing. A Python programming interface to HiAER-Spike, agnostic to hardware-level detail, shields the user from complexity in the configuration and execution of general spiking neural networks with minimal constraints in topology. The system is made easily available over a web portal for use by the wider community. In the following, we provide an overview of the hard- and software stack, explain the underlying design principles, demonstrate some of the system's capabilities and solicit feedback from the broader neuromorphic community. Examples are shown demonstrating HiAER-Spike's capabilities for event-driven vision on benchmark CIFAR-10, DVS event-based gesture, MNIST, and Pong tasks."}

However, most existing platforms exhibit rigid architectures with limited configurability, restricting their adaptability to heterogeneous workloads and diverse design objectives. To address these limitations, we present Flexi-NeurA -- a parameterizable neuromorphic accelerator (core) that unifies configurability, flexibility, and efficiency. Flexi-NeurA allows users to customize neuron models, network structures, and precision settings at design time. By pairing these design-time configurability and flexibility features with a time-multiplexed and event-driven processing approach, Flexi-NeurA substantially reduces the required hardware resources and total power while preserving high efficiency and low inference latency. Complementing this, we introduce Flex-plorer, a heuristic-guided design-space exploration (DSE) tool that determines cost-effective fixed-point precisions for critical parameters -- such as decay factors, synaptic weights, and membrane potentials -- based on user-defined trade-offs between accuracy and resource usage. Based on the configuration selected through the Flex-plorer process, RTL code is configured to match the specified design. Comprehensive evaluations across MNIST, SHD, and DVS benchmarks demonstrate that the Flexi-NeurA and Flex-plorer co-framework achieves substantial improvements in accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency. A three-layer 256--128--10 fully connected network with LIF neurons mapped onto two processing cores achieves 97.23% accuracy on MNIST with 1.1~ms inference latency, utilizing only 1,623 logic cells, 7 BRAMs, and 111~mW of total power -- establishing Flexi-NeurA as a scalable, edge-ready neuromorphic platform."}

This process is traditionally manual and knowledge-intensive. We present QueryPlot, a semantic retrieval and mapping framework that integrates large-scale geological text corpora with geologic map data using modern Natural Language Processing techniques. We curate descriptive deposit models for over 120 deposit types and transform the State Geologic Map Compilation (SGMC) polygons into structured textual representations. Given a user-defined natural language query, the system encodes both queries and region descriptions using a pretrained embedding model and computes semantic similarity scores to rank and spatially visualize regions as continuous evidence layers. QueryPlot supports compositional querying over deposit characteristics, enabling aggregation of multiple similarity-derived layers for multi-criteria prospectivity analysis. In a case study on tungsten skarn deposits, we demonstrate that embedding-based retrieval achieves high recall of known occurrences and produces prospective regions that closely align with expert-defined permissive tracts. Furthermore, similarity scores can be incorporated as additional features in supervised learning pipelines, yielding measurable improvements in classification performance. QueryPlot is implemented as a web-based system supporting interactive querying, visualization, and export of GIS-compatible prospectivity layers.To support future research, we have made the source code and datasets used in this study publicly available."}

Starting from Gemini Enterprise Agent-to-Agent (A2A) invocation, we implement an A2A Hub orchestrator on Cloud Run that routes queries to four paths: a public A2A agent deployed in a different project, an IAM-protected Cloud Run A2A agent in a different account, a retrieval-augmented generation path combining Discovery Engine and Vertex AI Search with direct retrieval of source text from Google Cloud Storage, and a general question answering path via Vertex AI. We show that practical interoperability is governed not only by protocol compliance but also by Gemini Enterprise UI constraints and boundary-dependent authentication. Real UI requests arrive as text-only inputs and include empty accepted output mode lists, so mixing structured data into JSON-RPC responses can trigger UI errors. To address this, we enforce a text-only compatibility mode on the JSON-RPC endpoint while separating structured outputs and debugging signals into a REST tool API. On a four-query benchmark spanning expense policy, project management assistance, general knowledge, and incident response deadline extraction, we confirm deterministic routing and stable UI responses.

These challenges become particularly prominent when generating captions for motion-centric videos, where precise depiction of intricate movements and limb dynamics is crucial yet often neglected. To alleviate this gap, we introduce an automated annotation pipeline that integrates kinematic-based motion computation with linguistic parsing, enabling detailed decomposition and description of complex human motions. Based on this pipeline, we construct and release the Kinematic Parsing Motion Benchmark (KPM-Bench), a novel open-source dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained motion understanding. KPM-Bench consists of (i) fine-grained video-caption pairs that comprehensively illustrate limb-level dynamics in complex actions, (ii) diverse and challenging question-answer pairs focusing specifically on motion understanding, and (iii) a meticulously curated evaluation set specifically designed to assess hallucination phenomena associated with motion descriptions. Furthermore, to address hallucination issues systematically, we propose the linguistically grounded Motion Parsing and Extraction (MoPE) algorithm, capable of accurately extracting motion-specific attributes directly from textual captions. Leveraging MoPE, we introduce a precise hallucination evaluation metric that functions independently of large-scale vision-language or language-only models. By integrating MoPE into the GRPO post-training framework, we effectively mitigate hallucination problems, significantly improving the reliability of motion-centric video captioning models."}

Traditionally, social minds have been regarded as an exclusive property of living beings. Although large language models (LLMs) are widely accepted as powerful approximations of human behavior, with multi-LLM system being extensively explored to enhance their capabilities, it remains controversial whether they can be meaningfully compared to human social minds. In this work, we explore neural synchrony between socially interacting LLMs as an empirical evidence for this debate. Specifically, we introduce neural synchrony during social simulations as a novel proxy for analyzing the sociality of LLMs at the representational level. Through carefully designed experiments, we demonstrate that it reliably reflects both social engagement and temporal alignment in their interactions. Our findings indicate that neural synchrony between LLMs is strongly correlated with their social performance, highlighting an important link between neural synchrony and the social behaviors of LLMs. Our work offers a new perspective to examine the \"social minds\" of LLMs, highlighting surprising parallels in the internal dynamics that underlie human and LLM social interaction."}

Existing methods that tackle text-to-hand-motion generation or hand animation captioning rely on studio-captured datasets with limited actions and contexts, making them costly to scale to \"in-the-wild\" settings. Further, contemporary models and their training schemes struggle to capture animation fidelity with text-motion alignment. To address this, we (1) introduce '3D Hands in the Wild' (3D-HIW), a dataset of 32K 3D hand-motion sequences and aligned text, and (2) propose CLUTCH, an LLM-based hand animation system with two critical innovations: (a) SHIFT, a novel VQ-VAE architecture to tokenize hand motion, and (b) a geometric refinement stage to finetune the LLM. To build 3D-HIW, we propose a data annotation pipeline that combines vision-language models (VLMs) and state-of-the-art 3D hand trackers, and apply it to a large corpus of egocentric action videos covering a wide range of scenarios. To fully capture motion in-the-wild, CLUTCH employs SHIFT, a part-modality decomposed VQ-VAE, which improves generalization and reconstruction fidelity. Finally, to improve animation quality, we introduce a geometric refinement stage, where CLUTCH is co-supervised with a reconstruction loss applied directly to decoded hand motion parameters. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on text-to-motion and motion-to-text tasks, establishing the first benchmark for scalable in-the-wild hand motion modelling.

However, this task remains challenging due to the presence of texture-less surfaces, complex illumination patterns, deformation, and a lack of in-vivo datasets with reliable ground truth. In this paper, we propose **PRISM** (Pose-Refinement with Intrinsic Shading and edge Maps), a self-supervised learning framework that leverages anatomical and illumination priors to guide geometric learning. Our approach uniquely incorporates edge detection and luminance decoupling for structural guidance. Specifically, edge maps are derived using a learning-based edge detector (e.g., DexiNed or HED) trained to capture thin and high-frequency boundaries, while luminance decoupling is obtained through an intrinsic decomposition module that separates shading and reflectance, enabling the model to exploit shading cues for depth estimation. Experimental results on multiple real and synthetic datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. We further conduct a thorough ablation study on training data selection to establish best practices for pose and depth estimation in colonoscopy. This analysis yields two practical insights: (1) self-supervised training on real-world data outperforms supervised training on realistic phantom data, underscoring the superiority of domain realism over ground truth availability; and (2) video frame rate is an extremely important factor for model performance, where dataset-specific video frame sampling is necessary for generating high quality training data."}

Although effective on average, steering effect sizes vary across samples and are unreliable for many target behaviors. In my thesis, I investigate why steering reliability differs across behaviors and how it is impacted by steering vector training data. First, I find that higher cosine similarity between training activation differences predicts more reliable steering. Second, I observe that behavior datasets where positive and negative activations are better separated along the steering direction are more reliably steerable. Finally, steering vectors trained on different prompt variations are directionally distinct, yet perform similarly well and exhibit correlated efficacy across datasets. My findings suggest that steering vectors are unreliable when the latent target behavior representation is not effectively approximated by the linear steering direction. Taken together, these insights offer a practical diagnostic for steering unreliability and motivate the development of more robust steering methods that explicitly account for non-linear latent behavior representations."}

However, the limited on-chip memory of these accelerators forces inference runtimes to swap model segments between host and accelerator memory, substantially inflating latency. While collaborative processing by partitioning the model processing between CPU and accelerator resources can reduce accelerator memory pressure and latency, naive partitioning may worsen end-to-end latency by either shifting excessive computation to the CPU or failing to sufficiently curb swapping, a problem that is further amplified in multi-tenant and dynamic environments.\n  To address these issues, we present SwapLess, a system for adaptive, multi-tenant TPU-CPU collaborative inference for memory-constrained Edge TPUs. SwapLess utilizes an analytic queueing model that captures partition-dependent CPU/TPU service times as well as inter- and intra-model swapping overheads across different workload mixes and request rates. Using this model, SwapLess continuously adjusts both the partition point and CPU core allocation online to minimize end-to-end response time with low decision overhead. An implementation on Edge TPU-equipped platforms demonstrates that SwapLess reduces mean latency by up to 63.8% for single-tenant workloads and up to 77.4% for multi-tenant workloads relative to the default Edge TPU compiler."}

However, the standard multi-step Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining is resource-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming, which is also often unavailable in many areas. Consequently, predicting HER2 levels directly from H&E slides has emerged as a potential alternative solution. It has been shown to be effective to use virtual IHC images from H&E images for automatic HER2 scoring. However, the pixel-level virtual staining methods are computationally expensive and prone to reconstruction artifacts that can propagate diagnostic errors. To address these limitations, we propose the Latent-Guided Dual-Stream Network (LGD-Net), a novel framework that employes cross-modal feature hallucination instead of explicit pixel-level image generation. LGD-Net learns to map morphological H&E features directly to the molecular latent space, guided by a teacher IHC encoder during training. To ensure the hallucinated features capture clinically relevant phenotypes, we explicitly regularize the model training with task-specific domain knowledge, specifically nuclei distribution and membrane staining intensity, via lightweight auxiliary regularization tasks. Extensive experiments on the public BCI dataset demonstrate that LGD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline methods while enabling efficient inference using single-modality H&E inputs."}

Existing GPU memory estimators span three paradigms -- analytical models, CPU-side libraries, and ML-based estimators -- each with distinct limitations: dependence on detailed model specifications, intrusive integration, poor generalization, and varying latency overhead. GPU heterogeneity further complicates estimation, as identical tasks can exhibit markedly different memory footprints across hardware generations.

Recent studies suggest that plain Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders, when scaled with sufficient capacity and large-scale pre-training, can conduct accurate image segmentation without requiring specialized modules. Motivated by this observation, we propose the Video Encoder-only Mask Transformer (VidEoMT), a simple encoder-only video segmentation model that eliminates the need for dedicated tracking modules. To enable temporal modeling in an encoder-only ViT, VidEoMT introduces a lightweight query propagation mechanism that carries information across frames by reusing queries from the previous frame. To balance this with adaptability to new content, it employs a query fusion strategy that combines the propagated queries with a set of temporally-agnostic learned queries. As a result, VidEoMT attains the benefits of a tracker without added complexity, achieving competitive accuracy while being 5x--10x faster, running at up to 160 FPS with a ViT-L backbone.

This paper presents the first systematic comparison of instruction optimization, based on the DSPy optimization framework, for tabular fact verification. We evaluate four out-of-the-box prompting techniques that cover both text-only prompting and code use: direct prediction, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), ReAct with SQL tools, and CodeAct with Python execution. We study three optimizers from the DSPy framework -- COPRO, MiPROv2, and SIMBA -- across four benchmarks and three model families. We find that instruction optimization consistently improves verification accuracy, with MiPROv2 yielding the most stable gains for CoT, and SIMBA providing the largest benefits for ReAct agents, particularly at larger model scales. Behavioral analyses reveal that SIMBA encourages more direct reasoning paths by applying heuristics, thereby improving numerical comparison abilities in CoT reasoning and helping avoid unnecessary tool calls in ReAct agents. Across different prompting techniques, CoT remains effective for tabular fact checking, especially with smaller models. Although ReAct agents built with larger models can achieve competitive performance, they require careful instruction optimization."}

For many downstream tasks, however, the clinically meaningful unit is not a single CUI but a concept set comprising related synonyms, subtypes, and supertypes. Constructing such concept sets is labour-intensive, inconsistently performed, and poorly supported by existing tools, particularly for NLP pipelines that operate directly on UMLS CUIs. Methods We present CUICurate, a Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) framework for automated UMLS concept set curation. A UMLS knowledge graph (KG) was constructed and embedded for semantic retrieval. For each target concept, candidate CUIs were retrieved from the KG, followed by large language model (LLM) filtering and classification steps comparing two LLMs (GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini). The framework was evaluated on five lexically heterogeneous clinical concepts against a manually curated benchmark and gold-standard concept sets. Results Across all concepts, CUICurate produced substantially larger and more complete concept sets than the manual benchmarks whilst matching human precision. Comparisons between the two LLMs found that GPT-5-mini achieved higher recall during filtering, while GPT-5 produced classifications that more closely aligned with clinician judgements. Outputs were stable across repeated runs and computationally inexpensive. Conclusions CUICurate offers a scalable and reproducible approach to support UMLS concept set curation that substantially reduces manual effort. By integrating graph-based retrieval with LLM reasoning, the framework produces focused candidate concept sets that can be adapted to clinical NLP pipelines for different phenotyping and analytic requirements."}

We study a frequent failure mode in which the correct document is retrieved but the page or chunk that contains the answer is missed, leading the generator to extrapolate from incomplete context. Despite its practical significance, this within-document retrieval failure mode has received limited systematic attention in the Financial Question Answering (QA) literature. We evaluate retrieval at multiple levels of granularity, document, page, and chunk level, and introduce an oracle based analysis to provide empirical upper bounds on retrieval and generative performance. On a 150 question subset of FinanceBench, we reproduce and compare diverse retrieval strategies including dense, sparse, hybrid, and hierarchical methods with reranking and query reformulation. Across methods, gains in document discovery tend to translate into stronger page recall, yet oracle performance still suggests headroom for page and chunk level retrieval. To target this gap, we introduce a domain fine-tuned page scorer that treats pages as an intermediate retrieval unit between documents and chunks. Unlike prior passage-based hierarchical retrieval, we fine-tune a bi-encoder specifically for page-level relevance on financial filings, exploiting the semantic coherence of pages. Overall, our results demonstrate a significant improvement in page recall and chunk retrieval."}

An edge device, in collaboration with a hub device and a cloud server, often suffices for their reliable and efficient execution. However, task allocation in this streamlined architecture is challenging due to device limitations and diverse operating conditions. Given the inherent criticality of such workflow applications, where reliability and latency are vital yet conflicting objectives, an exact task allocation approach is typically required to ensure optimal solutions. As no existing method holistically addresses these issues, we propose an exact multi-objective task allocation framework to jointly optimize the overall reliability and latency of a workflow application in the specific edge-hub-cloud architecture. We present a comprehensive binary integer linear programming formulation that considers the relative importance of each objective. It incorporates time redundancy techniques, while accounting for crucial constraints often overlooked in related studies. We evaluate our approach using a relevant real-world workflow application, as well as synthetic workflows varying in structure, size, and criticality. In the real-world application, our method achieved average improvements of 84.19% in reliability and 49.81% in latency over baseline strategies, across relevant objective trade-offs. Overall, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach across diverse workflow applications for the considered system architecture, highlighting its practicality with runtimes averaging between 0.03 and 50.94 seconds across all examined workflows."}

However, the inherently redundant nature of video sequences poses significant challenges for contemporary state-of-the-art models. These challenges stem from two primary aspects: 1) efficiently incorporating a larger number of frames within memory constraints, and 2) extracting discriminative information from the vast volume of input data. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end schema for long-form video understanding, which includes an information-density-based adaptive video sampler (AVS) and an autoencoder-based spatiotemporal video compressor (SVC) integrated with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our proposed system offers two major advantages: it adaptively and effectively captures essential information from video sequences of varying durations, and it achieves high compression rates while preserving crucial discriminative information. The proposed framework demonstrates promising performance across various benchmarks, excelling in both long-form video understanding tasks and standard video understanding benchmarks. These results underscore the versatility and efficacy of our approach, particularly in managing the complexities of prolonged video sequences."}

As AI systems evolve from static models to compound, tool-using agents, evaluation becomes a core control function. The question is no longer \"How good is the model?\" but \"Can we trust the system to behave as intended, under change, at scale?\". Yet most evaluation practices remain anchored in assumptions inherited from the model-centric era: static benchmarks, aggregate scores, and one-off success criteria. This paper argues that such approaches are increasingly obscure rather than illuminating system behavior. We examine how evaluation pipelines themselves introduce silent failure modes, why high benchmark scores routinely mislead teams, and how agentic systems fundamentally alter the meaning of performance measurement. Rather than proposing new metrics or harder benchmarks, we aim to clarify the role of evaluation in the AI era, and especially for agents: not as performance theater, but as a measurement discipline that conditions trust, iteration, and governance in non-deterministic systems."}

First introduced in the seminal paper by Naor and Stockmeyer [STOC 1993], these are graph problems that can be described by listing a finite set of valid local neighborhoods. This seemingly simple definition strikes a careful balance between two objectives: they are a family of problems that is broad enough so that it captures numerous problems that are of interest to researchers working in this field, yet restrictive enough so that it is possible to prove strong theorems that hold for all LCL problems. In particular, the distributed complexity landscape of LCL problems is now very well understood.\n  In this work we show that the family of LCL problems is extremely robust to variations. We present a very restricted family of locally checkable problems (essentially, the \"node-edge checkable\" formalism familiar from round elimination, restricted to regular unlabeled graphs); most importantly, such problems cannot directly refer to e.g. the existence of short cycles. We show that one can translate between the two formalisms (there are local reductions in both directions that only need access to a symmetry-breaking oracle, and hence the overhead is at most an additive $O(\\log^* n)$ rounds in the LOCAL model)."}

We test a large number of recent VLMs on fine-grained classification benchmarks and identify potential factors in the disconnect between fine-grained knowledge and other vision benchmarks. Through a series of ablation experiments, we find that using a better LLM improves all benchmark scores equally, while a better vision encoder disproportionately improves fine-grained classification performance. Furthermore, we find that the pretraining stage is also vital to fine-grained performance, particularly when the language model weights are unfrozen during pretraining. These insights pave the way for enhancing fine-grained visual understanding and vision-centric capabilities in VLMs."}

Generating deployment plans that account for these dynamic factors is non-trivial, due to fluctuations in application behaviour and variations in the carbon intensity of infrastructure nodes. In this paper, we present an approach for the automatic generation of deployment plans guided by green constraints. These constraints are derived from a continuous analysis of energy consumption patterns, inter-component communication, and the environmental characteristics of the underlying infrastructure. This paper introduces a methodology and architecture for the generation of a set of green-aware constraints that inform the scheduler to produce environmentally friendly deployment plans. We demonstrate how these constraints can be automatically learned and updated over time using monitoring data, enabling adaptive, energy-aware orchestration.

However, in practice, the quality and consistency of the synthesized views are fundamentally limited by the reliability of the underlying depth estimates, which are often fragile under low texture, adverse weather, and occlusion-heavy real-world conditions. In this work, we show that incorporating sparse multimodal range measurements provides a simple yet effective way to overcome these limitations. We introduce a multimodal depth reconstruction framework that leverages extremely sparse range sensing data, such as automotive radar or LiDAR, to produce dense depth maps that serve as robust geometric conditioning for diffusion-based novel view synthesis. Our approach models depth in an angular domain using a localized Gaussian Process formulation, enabling computationally efficient inference while explicitly quantifying uncertainty in regions with limited observations. The reconstructed depth and uncertainty are used as a drop-in replacement for monocular depth estimators in existing diffusion-based rendering pipelines, without modifying the generative model itself. Experiments on real-world multimodal driving scenes demonstrate that replacing vision-only depth with our sparse range-based reconstruction substantially improves both geometric consistency and visual quality in single-image novel-view video generation. These results highlight the importance of reliable geometric priors for diffusion-based view synthesis and demonstrate the practical benefits of multimodal sensing even at extreme levels of sparsity."}

An effective approach is representation alignment, where a strong vision foundation model is used to guide a 2D VLA model. However, existing methods usually apply supervision at only a single layer, failing to fully exploit the rich information distributed across depth; meanwhile, naïve multi-layer alignment can cause gradient interference. We introduce ROCKET, a residual-oriented multi-layer representation alignment framework that formulates multi-layer alignment as aligning one residual stream to another. Concretely, ROCKET employs a shared projector to align multiple layers of the VLA backbone with multiple layers of a powerful 3D vision foundation model via a layer-invariant mapping, which reduces gradient conflicts. We provide both theoretical justification and empirical analyses showing that a shared projector is sufficient and outperforms prior designs, and further propose a Matryoshka-style sparse activation scheme for the shared projector to balance multiple alignment losses. Our experiments show that, combined with a training-free layer selection strategy, ROCKET requires only about 4% of the compute budget while achieving 98.5% state-of-the-art success rate on LIBERO. We further demonstrate the superior performance of ROCKET across LIBERO-Plus and RoboTwin, as well as multiple VLA models.

Here we show that lossless compression provides a simple, model-agnostic measure of statistical regularity that differentiates generative regimes directly from surface text. We analyze compression behavior across three progressively more complex information ecosystems: controlled human-LLM continuations, generative mediation of a knowledge infrastructure (Wikipedia vs. Grokipedia), and fully synthetic social interaction environments (Moltbook vs. Reddit). Across settings, compression reveals a persistent structural signature of probabilistic generation. In controlled and mediated contexts, LLM-produced language exhibits higher structural regularity and compressibility than human-written text, consistent with a concentration of output within highly recurrent statistical patterns. However, this signature shows scale dependence: in fragmented interaction environments the separation attenuates, suggesting a fundamental limit to surface-level distinguishability at small scales. This compressibility-based separation emerges consistently across models, tasks, and domains and can be observed directly from surface text without relying on model internals or semantic evaluation. Overall, our findings introduce a simple and robust framework for quantifying how generative systems reshape textual production, offering a structural perspective on the evolving complexity of communication."}

Inspired by this biological memory mechanism, we propose a memory-driven quality-aware framework (MQAF), which establishes a memory bank for storing distortion patterns and dynamically switches between dual-mode quality assessment strategies to reduce reliance on high-quality reference images. When reference images are available, MQAF obtains reference-guided quality scores by adaptively weighting reference information and comparing the distorted image with stored distortion patterns in the memory bank. When the reference image is absent, the framework relies on distortion patterns in the memory bank to infer image quality, enabling no-reference quality assessment (NR-IQA).

With this in mind, this paper proposes an LLM-centric Affective Visual Customization (L-AVC) task, which focuses on generating images within modifying their subjective emotions via Multimodal LLM. Further, this paper contends that how to make the model efficiently align emotion conversion in semantics (named inter-emotion semantic conversion) and how to precisely retain emotion-agnostic contents (named exter-emotion semantic retaining) are rather important and challenging in this L-AVC task. To this end, this paper proposes an Efficient and Precise Emotion Manipulating approach for editing subjective emotions in images. Specifically, an Efficient Inter-emotion Converting (EIC) module is tailored to make the LLM efficiently align emotion conversion in semantics before and after editing, followed by a Precise Exter-emotion Retaining (PER) module to precisely retain the emotion-agnostic contents. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on our constructed L-AVC dataset demonstrate the great advantage of the proposed EPEM approach to the L-AVC task over several state-of-the-art baselines. This justifies the importance of emotion information for L-AVC and the effectiveness of EPEM in efficiently and precisely manipulating such information."}

Existing samplers typically adopt greedy heuristics, prioritizing positions with the highest local certainty to decode at each step. Through failure case analysis, we identify a fundamental limitation of this approach: it neglects the downstream impact of current decoding choices on subsequent steps and fails to minimize cumulative uncertainty. In particular, these methods do not fully exploit the non-causal nature of MDMs, which enables evaluating how a decoding decision reshapes token probabilities/uncertainty across all remaining masked positions. To bridge this gap, we propose the Info-Gain Sampler, a principled decoding framework that balances immediate uncertainty with information gain over future masked tokens. Extensive evaluations across diverse architectures and tasks (reasoning, coding, creative writing, and image generation) demonstrate that Info-Gain Sampler consistently outperforms existing samplers for MDMs. For instance, it achieves a 3.6% improvement in average accuracy on reasoning tasks and a 63.1% win-rate in creative writing.

Furthermore, this paper reveals two key challenges in the proposed task: 1) how to effectively model the coarse-to-fine physical-world information (e.g., human behavior, object interactions and background context) to boost the DeepSVU task; and 2) how to adaptively trade off these factors. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a new Unified Physical-world Regularized MoE (UPRM) approach. Specifically, UPRM incorporates two key components: the Unified Physical-world Enhanced MoE (UPE) Block and the Physical-world Trade-off Regularizer (PTR), to address the above two challenges, respectively. Extensive experiments conduct on our DeepSVU instructions datasets (i.e., UCF-C instructions and CUVA instructions) demonstrate that UPRM outperforms several advanced Video-LLMs as well as non-VLM approaches.

This study proposes a measure of processing storage cost based on an information-theoretic formalization, as the amount of information previous words carry about future context, under uncertainty. Unlike previous discrete, grammar-based metrics, this measure is continuous, theory-neutral, and can be estimated from pre-trained neural language models. The validity of this approach is demonstrated through three analyses in English: our measure (i) recovers well-known processing asymmetries in center embeddings and relative clauses, (ii) correlates with a grammar-based storage cost in a syntactically-annotated corpus, and (iii) predicts reading-time variance in two large-scale naturalistic datasets over and above baseline models with traditional information-based predictors."}

Inspired by the finding that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) in language models can act as \"key-value memory\", we propose Uncertainty-aware Observation Reinjection (UAOR), an effective, training-free and plug-and-play module for VLA models. Specifically, when the current language model layer exhibits high uncertainty, measured by Action Entropy, it reinjects key observation information into the next layer's Feed-Forward Network (FFN) through attention retrieval. This mechanism helps VLAs better attend to observations during inference, enabling more confident and faithful action generation. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently improves diverse VLA models across simulation and real-world tasks with minimal overhead.

Our method, Confidence-Driven Contrastive Decoding, detects low-confidence tokens during decoding and intervenes selectively at these positions. It constructs a contrastive reference by replacing high-confidence tokens with minimal placeholders, and refines predictions by subtracting this reference distribution at low-confidence locations. Experiments show that CCD significantly improves accuracy across mathematical reasoning benchmarks while substantially reducing output length, with minimal KV-cache overhead. As a training-free method, CCD enhances reasoning reliability through targeted low-confidence intervention without computational redundancy.

Existing attention manipulation methods focus exclusively on the Key space to modulate attention routing, leaving the Value space -- which governs feature aggregation -- entirely unexploited. In this paper, we first reveal that both Key and Value projections in DiT's multi-modal attention layers exhibit a pronounced bias-delta structure, where token embeddings cluster tightly around a layer-specific bias vector. Building on this observation, we propose Dual-Channel Attention Guidance (DCAG), a training-free framework that simultaneously manipulates both the Key channel (controlling where to attend) and the Value channel (controlling what to aggregate). We provide a theoretical analysis showing that the Key channel operates through the nonlinear softmax function, acting as a coarse control knob, while the Value channel operates through linear weighted summation, serving as a fine-grained complement. Together, the two-dimensional parameter space $(δ_k, δ_v)$ enables more precise editing-fidelity trade-offs than any single-channel method. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark (700 images, 10 editing categories) demonstrate that DCAG consistently outperforms Key-only guidance across all fidelity metrics, with the most significant improvements observed in localized editing tasks such as object deletion (4.9% LPIPS reduction) and object addition (3.2% LPIPS reduction)."}

We address this challenge by designing, building, and evaluating ELIA (Explainable Language Interpretability Analysis), an interactive web application that simplifies the outcomes of various language model component analyses for a broader audience. The system integrates three key techniques -- Attribution Analysis, Function Vector Analysis, and Circuit Tracing -- and introduces a novel methodology: using a vision-language model to automatically generate natural language explanations (NLEs) for the complex visualizations produced by these methods. The effectiveness of this approach was empirically validated through a mixed-methods user study, which revealed a clear preference for interactive, explorable interfaces over simpler, static visualizations. A key finding was that the AI-powered explanations helped bridge the knowledge gap for non-experts; a statistical analysis showed no significant correlation between a user's prior LLM experience and their comprehension scores, suggesting that the system reduced barriers to comprehension across experience levels. We conclude that an AI system can indeed simplify complex model analyses, but its true power is unlocked when paired with thoughtful, user-centered design that prioritizes interactivity, specificity, and narrative guidance."}

Recent works typically apply semantically coarse category names as auxiliary contexts to guide the learning of discriminative visual features. However, such context provided by the action names is too limited to provide sufficient background knowledge for capturing novel spatial and temporal concepts in actions. In this paper, we propose DiST, an innovative Decomposition-incorporation framework for FSAR that makes use of decoupled Spatial and Temporal knowledge provided by large language models to learn expressive multi-granularity prototypes. In the decomposition stage, we decouple vanilla action names into diverse spatio-temporal attribute descriptions (action-related knowledge). Such commonsense knowledge complements semantic contexts from spatial and temporal perspectives. In the incorporation stage, we propose Spatial/Temporal Knowledge Compensators (SKC/TKC) to discover discriminative object-level and frame-level prototypes, respectively. In SKC, object-level prototypes adaptively aggregate important patch tokens under the guidance of spatial knowledge. Moreover, in TKC, frame-level prototypes utilize temporal attributes to assist in inter-frame temporal relation modeling. These learned prototypes thus provide transparency in capturing fine-grained spatial details and diverse temporal patterns. Experimental results show DiST achieves state-of-the-art results on five standard FSAR datasets."}

Vichara surpasses existing judgment prediction benchmarks on both datasets, with GPT-4o mini achieving the highest performance (F1: 81.5 on PredEx, 80.3 on ILDC_expert), followed by Llama-3.1-8B. Human evaluation of the generated explanations across Clarity, Linking, and Usefulness metrics highlights GPT-4o mini's superior interpretability."}

Existing 3D-oriented analysis methods adopt either isolated task-specific modeling or task-agnostic end-to-end paradigms to produce one-hop outputs, impeding the systematic accumulation of perceptual evidence for downstream reasoning. In parallel, recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit improved visual perception and can integrate visual and textual information effectively, yet their predominantly 2D-oriented designs fundamentally limit their ability to perceive and analyze volumetric medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose 3DMedAgent, a unified agent that enables 2D MLLMs to perform general 3D CT analysis without 3D-specific fine-tuning. 3DMedAgent coordinates heterogeneous visual and textual tools through a flexible MLLM agent, progressively decomposing complex 3D analysis into tractable subtasks that transition from global to regional views, from 3D volumes to informative 2D slices, and from visual evidence to structured textual representations. Central to this design, 3DMedAgent maintains a long-term structured memory that aggregates intermediate tool outputs and supports query-adaptive, evidence-driven multi-step reasoning. We further introduce the DeepChestVQA benchmark for evaluating unified perception-to-understanding capabilities in 3D thoracic imaging. Experiments across over 40 tasks demonstrate that 3DMedAgent consistently outperforms general, medical, and 3D-specific MLLMs, highlighting a scalable path toward general-purpose 3D clinical assistants.Code and data are available at \\href{https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/3DMedAgent}{https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/3DMedAgent}."}

We address this limitation with a two-phase training strategy for fine-grained road marking segmentation that removes full supervision during pretraining and halves the amount of training data during fine-tuning while still outperforming the comparable supervised baseline model. During the self-supervised pretraining, BEVFormer predictions are differentiably reprojected into the image plane and trained against multi-view semantic pseudo-labels generated by the widely used semantic segmentation model Mask2Former. A temporal loss encourages consistency across frames. The subsequent supervised fine-tuning phase requires only 50% of the dataset and significantly less training time. With our method, the fine-tuning benefits from rich priors learned during pretraining boosting the performance and BEV segmentation quality (up to +2.5pp mIoU over the fully supervised baseline) on nuScenes. It simultaneously halves the usage of annotation data and reduces total training time by up to two thirds. The results demonstrate that differentiable reprojection plus camera perspective pseudo labels yields transferable BEV features and a scalable path toward reduced-label autonomous perception."}

Each component targets a different source of inefficiency: i) pruning removes redundant neurons in MLP layers, ii) SVD reduces attention projections into compact low-rank factors, iii) and 8-bit quantization uniformly compresses all linear layers. At matched compression ratios, SPQ outperforms individual methods (SVD-only, pruning-only, or quantization-only) in perplexity, demonstrating the benefit of combining complementary techniques. Applied to LLaMA-2-7B, SPQ achieves up to 75% memory reduction while maintaining or improving perplexity (e.g., WikiText-2 5.47 to 4.91) and preserving accuracy on downstream benchmarks such as C4, TruthfulQA, and GSM8K. Compared to strong baselines like GPTQ and SparseGPT, SPQ offers competitive perplexity and accuracy while using less memory (6.86 GB vs. 7.16 GB for GPTQ). Moreover, SPQ improves inference throughput over GPTQ, achieving up to a 1.9x speedup, which further enhances its practicality for real-world deployment.

Using 113 International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) stations spanning diverse vegetated areas, we compare modality combinations with temporal parameterizations, using spatial cross-validation, to ensure geographic generalization. We also evaluate whether foundation model embeddings from IBM-NASA's Prithvi model improve upon traditional hand-crafted spectral features.

We introduce DohaScript, a large scale, multi writer dataset of handwritten Hindi text collected from 531 unique contributors. The dataset is designed as a parallel stylistic corpus, in which all writers transcribe the same fixed set of six traditional Hindi dohas (couplets). This controlled design enables systematic analysis of writer specific variation independent of linguistic content, and supports tasks such as handwriting recognition, writer identification, style analysis, and generative modeling. The dataset is accompanied by non identifiable demographic metadata, rigorous quality curation based on objective sharpness and resolution criteria, and page level layout difficulty annotations that facilitate stratified benchmarking. Baseline experiments demonstrate clear quality separation and strong generalization to unseen writers, highlighting the dataset's reliability and practical value.

Existing Cultural benchmarks are (i) Manually crafted, (ii) contain single-hop questions testing factual recall, and (iii) prohibitively costly to scale, leaving this deficiency largely unmeasured. To address this, we introduce VIRAASAT, a novel, semi-automated multi-hop approach for generating cultural specific multi-hop Question-Answering dataset for Indian culture. VIRAASAT leverages a Knowledge Graph comprising more than 700 expert-curated cultural artifacts, covering 13 key attributes of Indian culture (history, festivals, etc). VIRAASAT spans all 28 states and 8 Union Territories, yielding more than 3,200 multi-hop questions that necessitate chained cultural reasoning. We evaluate current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) LLMs on VIRAASAT and identify key limitations in reasoning wherein fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought(CoT) traces fails to ground and synthesize low-probability facts. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework named Symbolic Chain-of-Manipulation (SCoM). Adapting the Chain-of-Manipulation paradigm, we train the model to simulate atomic Knowledge Graph manipulations internally. SCoM teaches the model to reliably traverse the topological structure of the graph. Experiments on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) demonstrate that SCoM outperforms standard CoT baselines by up to 20%. We release the VIRAASAT dataset along with our findings, laying a strong foundation towards building Culturally Aware Reasoning Models."}

We observe that model outputs evolve smoothly along much of the diffusion trajectory, enabling principled predictions rather than naive reuse. Based on this insight, we propose \\textbf{PrediT}, a training-free acceleration framework that formulates feature prediction as a linear multistep problem. We employ classical linear multistep methods to forecast future model outputs from historical information, combined with a corrector that activates in high-dynamics regions to prevent error accumulation. A dynamic step modulation mechanism adaptively adjusts the prediction horizon by monitoring the feature change rate. Together, these components enable substantial acceleration while preserving generation fidelity.

To mitigate this, AI literacy must expand beyond prompt engineering to address how students should detect and respond to LLM hallucinations. To support this, we need to understand how students experience hallucinations, how they detect them, and why they believe they occur. To investigate these questions, we asked university students three open-ended questions about their experiences with AI hallucinations, their detection strategies, and their mental models of why hallucinations occur. Sixty-three students responded to the survey. Thematic analysis of their responses revealed that reported hallucination issues primarily relate to incorrect or fabricated citations, false information, overconfident but misleading responses, poor adherence to prompts, persistence in incorrect answers, and sycophancy. To detect hallucinations, students rely either on intuitive judgment or on active verification strategies, such as cross-checking with external sources or re-prompting the model. Students' explanations for why hallucinations occur reflected several mental models, including notable misconceptions. Many described AI as a research engine that fabricates information when it cannot locate an answer in its \"database.\" Others attributed hallucinations to issues with training data, inadequate prompting, or the model's inability to understand or verify information. These findings illuminate vulnerabilities in AI-supported learning and highlight the need for explicit instruction in verification protocols, accurate mental models of generative AI, and awareness of behaviors such as sycophancy and confident delivery that obscure inaccuracy. The study contributes empirical evidence for integrating hallucination awareness and mitigation into AI literacy curricula."}

Furthermore, failure to appropriately handle out-of-distribution (OOD) objects may introduce safety risks in real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving or medical assistance). Unfortunately, current research has not yet provided valid benchmarks that can comprehensively assess the performance of VLMs in response to OOD data. Therefore, we propose OODBench, a predominantly automated method with minimal human verification, for constructing new benchmarks and evaluating the ability of VLMs to process OOD data. OODBench contains 40K instance-level OOD instance-category pairs, and we show that current VLMs still exhibit notable performance degradation on OODBench, even when the underlying image categories are common. In addition, we propose a reliable automated assessment metric that employs a Basic-to-Advanced Progression of prompted questions to assess the impact of OOD data on questions of varying difficulty more fully.

The second is selective survival, where narrative anchors persist while the texture of evidence, hedges, quotes, and attributions is stripped away. The third is competitive filtering, where strong arguments survive while weaker but valid considerations disappear when multiple viewpoints coexist. In downstream experiments, human participants rated AI-transmitted content as more credible and polished.

Current safety paradigms treat these failures as transient training artifacts, lacking a unified theoretical framework to explain their emergence and stability. Here we show that these misalignments are not errors, but mathematically rationalizable behaviors arising from model misspecification. By adapting Berk-Nash Rationalizability from theoretical economics to artificial intelligence, we derive a rigorous framework that models the agent as optimizing against a flawed subjective world model. We demonstrate that widely observed failures are structural necessities: unsafe behaviors emerge as either a stable misaligned equilibrium or oscillatory cycles depending on reward scheme, while strategic deception persists as a \"locked-in\" equilibrium or through epistemic indeterminacy robust to objective risks. We validate these theoretical predictions through behavioral experiments on six state-of-the-art model families, generating phase diagrams that precisely map the topological boundaries of safe behavior. Our findings reveal that safety is a discrete phase determined by the agent's epistemic priors rather than a continuous function of reward magnitude. This establishes Subjective Model Engineering, defined as the design of an agent's internal belief structure, as a necessary condition for robust alignment, marking a paradigm shift from manipulating environmental rewards to shaping the agent's interpretation of reality."}

Rather than relying on complex physical modeling, we propose a self-supervised and data-driven approach, whereby DMC learns to obtain physically plausible motions when an intentionally distorted motion and the original textual descriptions are given as inputs. We evaluate DMC as a post-hoc module to improve motions obtained from various text-to-motion generation models and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving physical plausibility while enhancing semantic consistency. The experimental results show that DMC reduces FID score by 42.74% on T2M and 13.20% on T2M-GPT, while also achieving the highest R-Precision. When applied to high-quality models like MoMask, DMC improves the physical plausibility of motions by reducing penetration by 33.0% as well as adjusting floating artifacts closer to the ground-truth reference. These results highlight that DMC can serve as a promising post-hoc motion refinement framework for any kind of text-to-motion models by incorporating textual semantics and physical plausibility."}

These attacks are computationally efficient, application-agnostic, and effective across classification, multimodal retrieval, and captioning tasks. Second, to defend against this vulnerability, inspired by recent work on robust CLIP encoders, we fine-tune popular tokenizers with unsupervised adversarial training, keeping all other components frozen. While unsupervised and task-agnostic, our approach significantly improves robustness to both unsupervised and end-to-end supervised attacks and generalizes well to unseen tasks and data.

Recent studies have shown that applying invertible transformations to activations can significantly improve quantization robustness by reducing activation outliers; however, existing approaches are largely restricted to rotation or Hadamard-based transformations. Moreover, most studies focused primarily on traditional quantization schemes, whereas modern hardware increasingly supports the microscaling (MX) data format. Attempts to combine both showed severe performance degradation, leading prior work to introduce assumptions on the transformations. In this work, we take a complementary perspective. First, we provide a theoretical analysis of transformations under MX quantization by deriving a bound on the quantization error. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of accounting for both the activation distribution and the underlying quantization structure. Building on this analysis, we propose LATMiX, a method that generalizes outlier reduction to learnable invertible affine transformations optimized using standard deep learning tools. Experiments show consistent improvements in average accuracy for MX low-bit quantization over strong baselines on a wide range of zero-shot benchmarks, across multiple model sizes."}

DEIG integrates an Instance Detail Extractor (IDE) that transforms text encoder embeddings into compact, instance-aware representations, and a Detail Fusion Module (DFM) that applies instance-based masked attention to prevent attribute leakage across instances. These components enable DEIG to generate visually coherent multi-instance scenes that precisely match rich, localized textual descriptions.

We introduce IRPAPERS, a benchmark of 3,230 pages from 166 scientific papers, with both an image and an OCR transcription for each page. Using 180 needle-in-the-haystack questions, we compare image- and text-based retrieval and question answering systems. Text retrieval using Arctic 2.0 embeddings, BM25, and hybrid text search achieved 46% Recall@1, 78% Recall@5, and 91% Recall@20, while image-based retrieval reaches 43%, 78%, and 93%, respectively. The two modalities exhibit complementary failures, enabling multimodal hybrid search to outperform either alone, achieving 49% Recall@1, 81% Recall@5, and 95% Recall@20. We further evaluate efficiency-performance tradeoffs with MUVERA and assess multiple multi-vector image embedding models. Among closed-source models, Cohere Embed v4 page image embeddings outperform Voyage 3 Large text embeddings and all tested open-source models, achieving 58% Recall@1, 87% Recall@5, and 97% Recall@20. For question answering, text-based RAG systems achieved higher ground-truth alignment than image-based systems (0.82 vs. 0.71), and both benefit substantially from increased retrieval depth, with multi-document retrieval outperforming oracle single-document retrieval.

In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Modal Masked Reconstruction (Robust-MMR), a self-supervised pre-training framework that explicitly incorporates robustness objectives into masked vision-language learning. Robust-MMR integrates asymmetric perturbation-aware masking, domain-consistency regularization, and modality-resilience constraints to encourage domain-invariant representations. We evaluate Robust-MMR on multiple medical vision-language benchmarks, including medical visual question answering (VQA-RAD, SLAKE, VQA-2019), cross-domain image-text classification (MELINDA), and robust image-caption retrieval (ROCO). Robust-MMR achieves 78.9% cross-domain accuracy on VQA-RAD, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.8 percentage points, and reaches 74.6% and 77.0% accuracy on SLAKE and VQA-2019, respectively. Under perturbed evaluation, Robust-MMR improves VQA-RAD accuracy from 69.1% to 75.6%.

We propose Diff2DGS, a novel two-stage framework for reliable 3D reconstruction of occluded surgical scenes. In the first stage, a diffusion-based video module with temporal priors inpaints tissue occluded by instruments with high spatial-temporal consistency.

HELIX computes a Unified Truth Score (UTS) combining token-level semantic entropy with Mahalanobis distance from the manifold. When UTS indicates trajectory divergence, graduated steering vectors redirect activations toward structurally coherent regions while affecting only 0.2-2.5% of tokens.\n  On 4-bit quantized Granite 4.0 H Small (32B/9B active, hybrid Mamba-Transformer): GSM8K maintains 88.84% accuracy at T = 3.0 (2.81pp degradation from T = 0.5); MMLU maintains 72.49% across 14,042 questions (1.24pp degradation).

We further establish a statistical separation from gradient descent, constructing tasks with temporally correlated noise where the optimal Bayesian predictor strictly outperforms any empirical risk minimization (ERM) estimator. Since Transformers can be seen as performing implicit ERM, this demonstrates selective SSMs achieve lower asymptotic risk due to superior statistical efficiency. Experiments on synthetic LG-SSM tasks and a character-level Markov benchmark confirm selective SSMs converge faster to Bayes-optimal risk, show superior sample efficiency with longer contexts in structured-noise settings, and track latent states more robustly than linear Transformers.

Our method augments a standard detection backbone with a lightweight embedding head trained via multi-layer contrastive learning. Images sharing the same degradation composition are pulled together, while differing degradation configurations are pushed apart, yielding a geometrically organized representation that captures degradation type and severity without requiring degradation labels or explicit density modeling.\n  To anchor the learned geometry, we estimate a pristine prototype from clean training embeddings, defining a nominal operating point in representation space. Self-awareness emerges as geometric deviation from this reference, providing an intrinsic, image-level signal of degradation-induced shift that is independent of detection confidence.\n  Extensive experiments on synthetic corruption benchmarks, cross-dataset zero-shot transfer, and natural weather-induced distribution shifts demonstrate strong pristine-degraded separability, consistent behavior across multiple detector architectures, and robust generalization under semantic shift.

However, existing BFA on LLM largely induce un-targeted failure or general performance degradation, offering limited control over manipulating specific or targeted outputs. In this paper, we present TFL, a novel targeted bit-flip attack framework that enables precise manipulation of LLM outputs for selected prompts while maintaining almost no or minor degradation on unrelated inputs. Within our TFL framework, we propose a novel keyword-focused attack loss to promote attacker-specified target tokens in generative outputs, together with an auxiliary utility score that balances attack effectiveness against collateral performance impact on benign data. We evaluate TFL on multiple LLMs (Qwen, DeepSeek, Llama) and benchmarks (DROP, GSM8K, and TriviaQA). The experiments show that TFL achieves successful targeted LLM output manipulations with less than 50 bit flips and significantly reduced effect on unrelated queries compared to prior BFA approaches.

We introduce Capability-Conditioned Navigation (CapNav), a benchmark designed to evaluate how well VLMs can navigate complex indoor spaces given an agent's specific physical and operational capabilities. CapNav defines five representative human and robot agents, each described with physical dimensions, mobility capabilities, and environmental interaction abilities. CapNav provides 45 real-world indoor scenes, 473 navigation tasks, and 2365 QA pairs to test if VLMs can traverse indoor environments based on agent capabilities.

To support varying gaze preferences, we introduce a gaze scoring mechanism with classifier-free guidance to decouple learning from control: the model captures natural spatial alignment from data, while users can adjust eye contact intensity at inference time. On the Embody 3D dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art motion quality at over 300 FPS -- 3x faster than non-causal baselines -- while capturing the subtle spatial dynamics of natural conversation. We validate our approach on a live VR system, bringing spatially-aware conversational agents to real-time deployment. Please see https://evonneng.github.io/sarah/ for details."}

Recent work has explored LLM-based agentic frameworks to automatically construct mechanistic models from data; however, existing problem settings substantially oversimplify real-world conditions, leaving it unclear whether LLM-generated mechanistic models are reliable in practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Neural-Integrated Mechanistic Modeling (NIMM) evaluation framework, which evaluates LLM-generated mechanistic models under realistic settings with partial observations and diversified task objectives. Our evaluation reveals fundamental challenges in current baselines, ranging from model effectiveness to code-level correctness. Motivated by these findings, we design NIMMgen, an agentic framework for neural-integrated mechanistic modeling that enhances code correctness and practical validity through iterative refinement. Experiments across three datasets from diversified scientific domains demonstrate its strong performance. We also show that the learned mechanistic models support counterfactual intervention simulation."}

A common problem is reward hacking, where the policy may exploit inaccuracies of the reward and learn an unintended behavior. Most previous works address this by limiting the policy update with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) penalty towards a reference model. We propose a different framing: Train the LM in a way that biases policy updates towards regions in which the reward is more accurate. First, we derive a theoretical connection between the accuracy of a reward model and the flatness of an optimum at convergence. Gradient regularization (GR) can then be used to bias training to flatter regions and thereby maintain reward model accuracy. We confirm these results by showing that the gradient norm and reward accuracy are empirically correlated in RLHF. We then show that Reference Resets of the KL penalty implicitly use GR to find flatter regions with higher reward accuracy. We further improve on this by proposing to use explicit GR with an efficient finite-difference estimate. Empirically, GR performs better than a KL penalty across a diverse set of RL experiments with LMs. GR achieves a higher GPT-judged win-rate in RLHF, avoids overly focusing on the format in rule-based math rewards, and prevents hacking the judge in LLM-as-a-Judge math tasks."}

We identify two sources of approximation error that may undermine the performance of CoT monitors in practice: information gap, which measures the extent to which the monitor can extract the information available in CoT, and elicitation error, which measures the extent to which the monitor approximates the optimal monitoring function. We further demonstrate that CoT monitorability can be systematically improved through targeted training objectives. To this end, we propose two complementary approaches: (a) an oracle-based method that directly rewards the monitored model for producing CoTs that maximize monitor accuracy, and (b) a more practical, label-free approach that maximizes conditional mutual information between outputs and CoTs. Across multiple different environments, we show both methods significantly improve monitor accuracy while preventing CoT degeneration even when training against a monitor, thereby mitigating reward hacking when the task reward is imperfectly specified."}

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) forecasting from satellite observations, however, remains challenging due to sparse and irregular sampling caused by cloud coverage, as well as the heterogeneous climatic conditions under which crops evolve. In this work, we propose a probabilistic forecasting framework specifically designed for field-level NDVI prediction under clear-sky acquisition constraints. The method leverages a transformer-based architecture that explicitly separates the modeling of historical vegetation dynamics from future exogenous information, integrating historical NDVI observations with both historical and future meteorological covariates. To address irregular revisit patterns and horizon-dependent uncertainty, we introduce a temporal-distance weighted quantile loss that aligns the training objective with the effective forecasting horizon. In addition, we incorporate cumulative and extreme-weather feature engineering to better capture delayed meteorological effects relevant to vegetation response. Extensive experiments on European satellite data demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms a diverse set of statistical, deep learning, and recent time series baselines across both point-wise and probabilistic evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further highlight the central role of target history, while showing that meteorological covariates provide complementary gains when jointly exploited.

In this paper, we study what information these proto-tokens encode and how they behave under reconstruction and controlled constraints. We perform a series of experiments aimed at disentangling semantic and syntactic content in the two proto-tokens, analyzing stability properties of the e-token, and visualizing attention patterns to the e-token during reconstruction. Finally, we test two regularization schemes for \"imposing\" semantic structure on the e-token using teacher embeddings, including an anchor-based loss and a relational distillation objective. Our results indicate that the m-token tends to capture semantic information more strongly than the e-token under standard optimization; anchor-based constraints trade off sharply with reconstruction accuracy; and relational distillation can transfer batch-level semantic relations into the proto-token space without sacrificing reconstruction quality, supporting the feasibility of future non-autoregressive seq2seq systems that predict proto-tokens as an intermediate representation."}

In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Modal Masked Reconstruction (Robust-MMR), a self-supervised pre-training framework that explicitly incorporates robustness objectives into masked vision-language learning. Robust-MMR integrates asymmetric perturbation-aware masking, domain-consistency regularization, and modality-resilience constraints to encourage domain-invariant representations. We evaluate Robust-MMR on multiple medical vision-language benchmarks, including medical visual question answering (VQA-RAD, SLAKE, VQA-2019), cross-domain image-text classification (MELINDA), and robust image-caption retrieval (ROCO). Robust-MMR achieves 78.9% cross-domain accuracy on VQA-RAD, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.8 percentage points, and reaches 74.6% and 77.0% accuracy on SLAKE and VQA-2019, respectively. Under perturbed evaluation, Robust-MMR improves VQA-RAD accuracy from 69.1% to 75.6%. For image-text classification, cross-domain MELINDA accuracy increases from 70.3% to 75.2%, while retrieval experiments show a reduction in mean rank degradation from over 16 to 4.1 under perturbation.

In particular, a growing body of literature has shown this limitation primarily through failures in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, such as length extrapolation. In this work, we shift attention to the in-distribution implications of these limitations. We conduct a large-scale experimental study of the data efficiency of transformers and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) across multiple supervision regimes. We find that the amount of training data required by transformers grows much more rapidly with state-space size and sequence length than for RNNs. Furthermore, we analyze the extent to which learned state-tracking mechanisms are shared across different sequence lengths. We show that transformers exhibit negligible or even detrimental weight sharing across lengths, indicating that they learn length-specific solutions in isolation. In contrast, recurrent models exhibit effective amortized learning by sharing weights across lengths, allowing data from one sequence length to improve performance on others. Together, these results demonstrate that state tracking remains a fundamental challenge for transformers, even when training and evaluation distributions match."}

Manual labeling is too time-consuming to process sufficient data to get reasonable results. Thus, an automatic solution to overcome the time-consuming data analysis is necessary. Basic mathematical models can detect events in simple environments, but they struggle with complex scenarios, like differentiating signals with a low signal-to-noise ratio or distinguishing clicks from echoes. Deep Learning Neural Networks, such as ANIMAL-SPOT, are better suited for such tasks. DNNs process audio signals as image representations, often using spectrograms created by Short-Time Fourier Transform. However, spectrograms have limitations due to the uncertainty principle, which creates a tradeoff between time and frequency resolution. Alternatives like the wavelet, which provides better time resolution for high frequencies and improved frequency resolution for low frequencies, may offer advantages for feature extraction in complex bioacoustic environments.

However, subtle and variable tumour appearances, differences in imaging protocols, and limited expert availability make consistent interpretation difficult. While automated methods aim to address this, they rely on large expertly-annotated datasets that are often inconsistent, whereas manual delineation remains labour-intensive. This work aims to bridge the gap between automated and manual segmentation through a framework driven by user-provided point prompts, enabling accurate segmentation with minimal annotation effort.\n  Methods: The framework combines reinforcement learning (RL) with a region-growing segmentation process guided by user prompts. Starting from an initial point prompt, region-growing generates a preliminary segmentation, which is iteratively refined through RL. At each step, the RL agent observes the image and current segmentation to predict a new point, from which region growing updates the mask. A reward, balancing segmentation accuracy and voxel-wise uncertainty, encourages exploration of ambiguous regions, allowing the agent to escape local optima and perform sample-specific optimisation. Despite requiring fully supervised training, the framework bridges manual and fully automated segmentation at inference by substantially reducing user effort while outperforming current fully automated methods.\n  Results: The framework was evaluated on two public prostate MR datasets (PROMIS and PICAI, with 566 and 1090 cases). It outperformed the previous best automated methods by 9.9% and 8.9%, respectively, with performance comparable to manual radiologist segmentation, reducing annotation time tenfold."}

However, in 3D medical imaging, they remain separate: diffusion for synthesis, SSL for analysis. Unifying 3D medical image synthesis and analysis is intuitive yet challenging, as multi-center datasets exhibit dominant style shifts, while downstream tasks rely on anatomy, and site-specific style co-varies with anatomy across slices, making factors unreliable without explicit constraints. In this paper, we propose MeDUET, a 3D Medical image Disentangled UnifiEd PreTraining framework that performs SSL in the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) latent space which explicitly disentangles domain-invariant content from domain-specific style. The token demixing mechanism serves to turn disentanglement from a modeling assumption into an empirically identifiable property. Two novel proxy tasks, Mixed-Factor Token Distillation (MFTD) and Swap-invariance Quadruplet Contrast (SiQC), are devised to synergistically enhance disentanglement. Once pretrained, MeDUET is capable of (i) delivering higher fidelity, faster convergence, and improved controllability for synthesis, and (ii) demonstrating strong domain generalization and notable label efficiency for analysis across diverse medical benchmarks.

Using nnU-Net, we trained a segmentation model on a novel dataset of spatial Raman spectra aligned with tumour annotations, achieving a mean foreground Dice score of 80.9%, surpassing previous work. Furthermore, we propose a novel, interpretable, prototype-based architecture called RamanSeg. RamanSeg classifies pixels based on discovered regions of the training set, generating a segmentation mask. Two variants of RamanSeg allow a trade-off between interpretability and performance: one with prototype projection and another projection-free version. The projection-free RamanSeg outperformed a U-Net baseline with a mean foreground Dice score of 67.3%, offering a meaningful improvement over a black-box training approach."}

While lines can constitute a robust intermediate representation that is consistently observed, the sparse nature of lines may lead to drastic deterioration with minor estimation errors. Only a few previous works, often accompanied by additional sensors, utilize lines to compensate for the severe domain discrepancies of event sensors along with unpredictable noise characteristics. We propose a method that can stably extract tracks of varying appearances of lines using a clever algorithmic process that observes multiple representations from various time slices of events, compensating for potential adversaries within the event data. We then propose geometric cost functions that can refine the 3D line maps and camera poses, eliminating projective distortions and depth ambiguities. The 3D line maps are highly compact and can be equipped with our proposed cost function, which can be adapted for any observations that can detect and extract line structures or projections of them, including 3D point cloud maps or image observations. We demonstrate that our formulation is powerful enough to exhibit a significant performance boost in event-based mapping and pose refinement across diverse datasets, and can be flexibly applied to multimodal scenarios. Our results confirm that the proposed line-based formulation is a robust and effective approach for the practical deployment of event-based perceptual modules.

By harnessing the dynamics of many-body spin Hamiltonians, the method generates expressive quantum features that, when combined with classical processing, lead to quantum-enhanced classification accuracy. Using a strong and well-established ResNet50 baseline, we achieved a maximum classical accuracy of 83%, which can be improved to 84% with a transfer learning approach. In contrast, applying our quantum-classical method the performance is increased to 87% accuracy, demonstrating a clear and reproducible improvement over robust classical approaches. Implemented on several of IBM's quantum processors, our hybrid quantum-classical approach delivers consistent gains of 2-3% in absolute accuracy. These results highlight the practical potential of current and near-term quantum processors in high-stakes, data-driven domains such as satellite imaging and remote sensing, while suggesting broader applicability in real-world machine learning tasks."}

Existing methods rely on external guidance to supply detailed missing state for instructing generative models to synthesize missing MRIs. However, manual indicators are not always available or reliable in real-world scenarios due to the unpredictable nature of clinical environments. Moreover, these explicit masks are not informative enough to provide guidance for improving semantic consistency. In this work, we argue that generative models should infer and recognize missing states in a self-perceptive manner, enabling them to better capture subtle anatomical and pathological variations. Towards this goal, we propose CoPeDiT, a general-purpose latent diffusion model equipped with completeness perception for unified synthesis of 3D MRIs. Specifically, we incorporate dedicated pretext tasks into our tokenizer, CoPeVAE, empowering it to learn completeness-aware discriminative prompts, and design MDiT3D, a specialized diffusion transformer architecture for 3D MRI synthesis, that effectively uses the learned prompts as guidance to enhance semantic consistency in 3D space. Comprehensive evaluations on three large-scale MRI datasets demonstrate that CoPeDiT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior robustness, generalizability, and flexibility.

While recent work suggests that high-dimensional concentration allows these models to implicitly estimate noise levels from corrupted observations, a fundamental paradox remains: what is the underlying landscape being optimized when the noise level is treated as a random variable, and how can a bounded, noise-agnostic network remain stable near the data manifold where gradients typically diverge? We resolve this paradox by formalizing Marginal Energy, $E_{\\text{marg}}(\\mathbf{u}) = -\\log p(\\mathbf{u})$, where $p(\\mathbf{u}) = \\int p(\\mathbf{u}|t)p(t)dt$ is the marginal density of the noisy data integrated over a prior distribution of unknown noise levels. We prove that generation using autonomous models is not merely blind denoising, but a specific form of Riemannian gradient flow on this Marginal Energy. Through a novel relative energy decomposition, we demonstrate that while the raw Marginal Energy landscape possesses a $1/t^p$ singularity normal to the data manifold, the learned time-invariant field implicitly incorporates a local conformal metric that perfectly counteracts the geometric singularity, converting an infinitely deep potential well into a stable attractor. We also establish the structural stability conditions for sampling with autonomous models. We identify a ``Jensen Gap'' in noise-prediction parameterizations that acts as a high-gain amplifier for estimation errors, explaining the catastrophic failure observed in deterministic blind models. Conversely, we prove that velocity-based parameterizations are inherently stable because they satisfy a bounded-gain condition that absorbs posterior uncertainty into a smooth geometric drift."}
