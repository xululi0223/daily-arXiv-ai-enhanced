A Structural Rebuttal to OpenAI's Hallucination Thesis", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "comment": "17 pages, references to prior work arXiv:2509.16297 and arXiv:2511.06073", "summary": "OpenAI has recently argued that hallucinations in large language models result primarily from misaligned evaluation incentives that reward confident guessing rather than epistemic humility. On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model.\n  Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence. No incentive mechanism can modify this structural dependence on pattern completion.\n  Our empirical results demonstrate that hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains precisely because it supplies grounding that the transformer lacks.\n  We conclude that hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures and that reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility."}

T5Gemma 2 follows the adaptation recipe (via UL2) in T5Gemma -- adapting a pretrained decoder-only model into an encoder-decoder model, and extends it from text-only regime to multimodal based on the Gemma 3 models. We further propose two methods to improve the efficiency: tied word embedding that shares all embeddings across encoder and decoder, and merged attention that unifies decoder self- and cross-attention into a single joint module. Experiments demonstrate the generality of the adaptation strategy over architectures and modalities as well as the unique strength of the encoder-decoder architecture on long context modeling. Similar to T5Gemma, T5Gemma 2 yields comparable or better pretraining performance and significantly improved post-training performance than its Gemma 3 counterpart.

However, the high computational cost of HE operations, particularly matrix multiplication (MM), remains a major barrier to its practical deployment. Accelerating homomorphic encrypted MM (HE MM) is therefore crucial for applications such as privacy-preserving machine learning.\n  In this paper, we present a bandwidth-efficient FPGA implementation of HE MM. We first develop a cost model to evaluate the on-chip memory requirements for a given set of HE parameters and input matrix sizes. Our analysis shows that optimizing on-chip memory usage is critical for scalable and efficient HE MM. To this end, we design a novel datapath for Homomorphic Linear Transformation (HLT), the primary bottleneck in HE MM. The proposed datapath significantly reduces off-chip memory traffic and on-chip memory demand by enabling fine-grained data reuse. Leveraging this datapath, we introduce FAME, the first FPGA-based accelerator specifically tailored for HE MM. FAME supports arbitrary matrix shapes and is configurable across a wide range of HE parameter sets. We implement FAME on an Alveo U280 FPGA and evaluate its performance across diverse matrix sizes and shapes. Experimental results show that FAME achieves an average speedup of 221x over state-of-the-art CPU-based implementations, demonstrating its scalability and practicality for large-scale consecutive HE MM and real-world workloads."}

This paper investigates six common paradigms, from the often-cited constraints of network latency and TCP congestion control algorithms to host-side factors such as CPU performance and virtualization that critically impact data movement workflows. We validated our findings using a latency-emulation-capable testbed for high-speed WAN performance prediction and through extensive production measurements from resource-constrained edge environments to a 100 Gbps operational link connecting Switzerland and California, U.S. These results show that the principal bottlenecks often reside outside the network core, and that a holistic hardware-software co-design ensures consistent performance, whether moving data at 1 Gbps or 100 Gbps and faster.

We introduce SkyCap, a bitemporal VHR optical-SAR dataset constructed by archive matching and co-registration of (optical) SkySat and Capella Space (SAR) scenes. We utilize optical-to-SAR label transfer to obtain SAR amplitude change detection (ACD) labels without requiring SAR-expert annotations.

While sparse and linearized attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate this, they often compromise the representation of global dependencies or fail to capture multiscale semantic granularity effectively. In this paper, we propose Multiscale Aggregated Hierarchical Attention (MAHA), a novel architectural framework that reformulates the attention mechanism through hierarchical decomposition and mathematically rigorous aggregation. Unlike conventional approaches that treat token interactions at a single resolution, MAHA dynamically partitions the input sequence into hierarchical scales via learnable downsampling operators. The core innovation lies in its aggregation strategy: we model the fusion of scalespecific attention matrices as a resource allocation problem, solved via a convex optimization framework or a Nash equilibriumbased gametheoretic approach. This ensures a theoretically optimal balance between local nuance and global context fidelity. Implemented within a hybrid dilatedconvolutional transformer backbone, MAHA utilizes differentiable optimization layers to enable endtoend training. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that MAHA achieves superior scalability; empirical FLOPs analysis confirms an 81% reduction in computational cost at a sequence length of 4096 compared to standard attention. This work bridges the gap between optimization theory and sequence modeling, offering a scalable solution for nextgeneration LLMs."}

This has led to a push to offload computations to general purpose hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs, and a renewed interest in designing problem-specific accelerators using FPGAs. However, the development process of these problem-specific accelerators currently suffers from the \"two-language problem\": algorithms are developed in one (usually higher-level) language, but the kernels are implemented in another language at a completely different level of abstraction and requiring fundamentally different expertise. To address this problem, we propose a new MLIR-based compiler toolchain that unifies the development process by automatically compiling kernels written in the Julia programming language into SystemVerilog without the need for any additional directives or language customisations. Our toolchain supports both dynamic and static scheduling, directly integrates with the AXI4-Stream protocol to interface with subsystems like on- and off-chip memory, and generates vendor-agnostic RTL. This prototype toolchain is able to synthesize a set of signal processing/mathematical benchmarks that can operate at 100MHz on real FPGA devices, achieving between 59.71% and 82.6% of the throughput of designs generated by state-of-the-art toolchains that only compile from low-level languages like C or C++. Overall, this toolchain allows domain experts to write compute kernels in Julia as they normally would, and then retarget them to an FPGA without additional pragmas or modifications."}

Additionally, we study the effectiveness of different small language model types (Phi, Qwen, and StableLM), routing strategies, and vision encoders (CLIP vs. SigLIP, frozen vs. fine-tuned). Experiments on the SNEI dataset demonstrate that SocialNav-MoE achieves an excellent balance between navigation accuracy and efficiency. The proposed SSR function is more effective than hard-level and character-level rewards. Source code will be released upon acceptance."}

Although CPU-optimized implementations have been well studied, GPU designs remain underexplored. We close this gap by exploring the design space on GPUs along three dimensions: vectorization, thread cooperation, and compute latency.\n  Our evaluation shows that the combination of these optimization points strongly affects throughput, with the largest gains achieved when the filter fits within the GPU's cache domain. We examine how the hardware responds to different parameter configurations and relate these observations to measured performance trends.

Since this requires both models to share the same probability space, it becomes challenging when the teacher and student LMs use different tokenizers, for instance, when edge-device deployment necessitates a smaller vocabulary size to lower memory overhead. In this work, we address this vocabulary misalignment problem by uncovering an implicit recursive structure in the commonly deployed Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm and utilizing it to create a probabilistic framework for cross-tokenizer likelihood scoring. Our method enables sequence likelihood evaluation for vocabularies different from the teacher model native tokenizer, addressing two specific scenarios: when the student vocabulary is a subset of the teacher vocabulary, and the general case where it is arbitrary. In the subset regime, our framework computes exact likelihoods and provides next-token probabilities for sequential sampling with only O(1) model evaluations per token. When used for distillation, this yields up to a 12% reduction in memory footprint for the Qwen2.5-1.5B model while also improving baseline performance up to 4% on the evaluated tasks. For the general case, we introduce a rigorous lossless procedure that leverages BPE recursive structure, complemented by a fast approximation that keeps large-vocabulary settings practical. Applied to distillation for mathematical reasoning, our approach improves GSM8K accuracy by more than 2% over the current state of the art."}

However, distributed databases also require consistent reads. To guarantee read consistency, a Raft-based system must either accept the high communication overhead of a safety check for each read, or implement leader leases. Prior lease protocols are vaguely specified and hurt availability, so most Raft systems implement them incorrectly or not at all. We introduce LeaseGuard, a novel lease algorithm that relies on guarantees specific to Raft elections. LeaseGuard is simple, rigorously specified in TLA+, and includes two novel optimizations that maximize availability during leader failover. The first optimization restores write throughput quickly, and the second improves read availability. We evaluate LeaseGuard with a simulation in Python and an implementation in LogCabin, the C++ reference implementation of Raft. By replacing LogCabin's default consistency mechanism (quorum checks), LeaseGuard reduces the overhead of consistent reads from one to zero network roundtrips. It also improves write throughput from ~1000 to ~10,000 writes per second, by eliminating contention between writes and quorum reads. Whereas traditional leases ban all reads on a new leader while it waits for a lease, in our LeaseGuard test the new leader instantly allows 99% of reads to succeed."}

AquaDiff integrates a chromatic prior-guided color compensation strategy with a conditional diffusion process, where cross-attention dynamically fuses degraded inputs and noisy latent states at each denoising step. An enhanced denoising backbone with residual dense blocks and multi-resolution attention captures both global color context and local details.

Existing solutions either force a uniform decision on the batch, which overlooks EE opportunities, or degrade output quality by forcing premature exits. We propose Dynamic Rebatching, a solution where we dynamically reorganize the batch at each early-exit point. Requests that meet the exit criteria are immediately processed, while those that continue are held in a buffer, re-grouped into a new batch, and forwarded to deeper layers. We introduce DREX, an early-exit inference system that implements Dynamic Rebatching with two key optimizations: 1) a copy-free rebatching buffer that avoids physical data movement, and 2) an EE and SLA-aware scheduler that analytically predicts whether a given rebatching operation will be profitable. DREX also efficiently handles the missing KV cache from skipped layers using memory-efficient state-copying.

In Vertical FL (VFL), where each party holds different features for the same users, a key challenge is to evaluate the feature contribution of each party before any model is trained, particularly in the early stages when no model exists. To address this, the Shapley-CMI method was recently proposed as a model-free, information-theoretic approach to feature valuation using Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). However, its original formulation did not provide a practical implementation capable of computing the required permutations and intersections securely. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving implementation of Shapley-CMI for VFL. Our system introduces a private set intersection (PSI) server that performs all necessary feature permutations and computes encrypted intersection sizes across discretized and encrypted ID groups, without the need for raw data exchange. Each party then uses these intersection results to compute Shapley-CMI values, computing the marginal utility of their features. Initial experiments confirm the correctness and privacy of the proposed system, demonstrating its viability for secure and efficient feature contribution estimation in VFL. This approach ensures data confidentiality, scales across multiple parties, and enables fair data valuation without requiring the sharing of raw data or training models."}

We present HERBench, a VideoQA benchmark purpose-built to assess multi-evidence integration across time. Each question requires aggregating at least three non-overlapping evidential cues across distinct video segments, so neither language priors nor a single snapshot can suffice. HERBench comprises 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into twelve compositional tasks that probe identity binding, cross-entity relations, temporal ordering, co-occurrence verification, and counting. To make evidential demand measurable, we introduce the Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS), the smallest number of frames a model must fuse to answer correctly, and show that HERBench imposes substantially higher demand than prior datasets (mean MRFS 5.5 vs. 2.6-4.2). Evaluating 13 state-of-the-art Video-LLMs on HERBench reveals pervasive failures: accuracies of 31-42% are only slightly above the 20% random-guess baseline. We disentangle this failure into two critical bottlenecks: (1) a retrieval deficit, where frame selectors overlook key evidence, and (2) a fusion deficit, where models fail to integrate information even when all necessary evidence is provided. By making cross-time evidence both unavoidable and quantifiable, HERBench establishes a principled target for advancing robust, compositional video understanding."}

This paper introduces an innovative sensor allocation optimization method that employs a Gradient-Based Iteration with Lagrange. The proposed method enhances coverage by utilizing a hybrid approach while minimizing the number of sensor nodes required under grid-based allocation. The proposed sensor distribution outperformed the classic deterministic deployment across coverage, number of sensors, cost, and power consumption. Furthermore, scalability is enhanced by extending sensing coverage to the remaining area via Bluetooth, which has a shorter communication range. Moreover, the proposed algorithm achieved 98.5% wireless sensor coverage, compared with 95% for the particle swarm distribution."}

We demonstrate that these specialist semantics abstract and encode animal coat topology using human-interpretable language tags. Drawing on 84,264 manually labelled minutiae across 3,355 images of 185 tigers (Panthera tigris), we evaluate this visual-textual methodology, revealing novel capabilities for cross-modal identity retrieval. To optimise performance, we developed a text-image co-synthesis pipeline to generate 'virtual individuals', each comprising dozens of life-like visuals paired with dermatoglyphic text. Benchmarking against real-world scenarios shows this augmentation significantly boosts AI accuracy in cross-modal retrieval while alleviating data scarcity. We conclude that dermatoglyphic language-guided biometrics can overcome vision-only limitations, enabling textual-to-visual identity recovery underpinned by human-verifiable matchings.

The benchmark comprises nine carefully selected whole slide images from nine unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns, with non-overlapping tissue patches extracted at both 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across eight augmentation conditions. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders. Our results reveal substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 achieved the lowest slide-level encoding among large-scale models (81.0%) yet exhibited the second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder, trained specifically on prostate tissue, demonstrated the highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and the strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%), suggesting tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signatures.

To address these issues, Machine Unlearning provides techniques to remove specific information from trained models without retraining from scratch. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating unlearning in LLMs face two major limitations: they focus only on English and support only entity-level forgetting (removing all information about a person). We introduce FAME (Fictional Actors for Multilingual Erasure), a synthetic benchmark for evaluating Machine Unlearning across five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. FAME contains 1,000 fictional actor biographies and 20,000 question-answer pairs. Each biography includes information on 20 topics organized into structured categories (biography, career, achievements, personal information). This design enables both entity-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting entire identities) and instance-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting specific facts while retaining others). We provide two dataset splits to support these two different unlearning scenarios and enable systematic comparison of unlearning techniques across languages. Since FAME uses entirely fictional data, it ensures that the information was never encountered during model pretraining, allowing for a controlled evaluation of unlearning methods."}

Camera-ready for WACV 2026", "summary": "Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic digital content, raising concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse. While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered. We show that our method achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. At the same time, the watermark remains highly imperceptible. Compared to prior post-hoc methods, our approach offers more interpretable detection while retaining competitive robustness. For example, our watermarks are robust to cropping up to half the image."}

We develop a frame-based annotation scheme that captures the constitutive elements of moralizations - moral values, demands, and discourse protagonists - and apply it to a diverse set of German texts, including political debates, news articles, and online discussions. The corpus enables fine-grained analysis of moralizing language across communicative formats and domains.

This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions. The results establish a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based inference of social interactions suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks, with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware."}

This raises a fundamental question: what makes some questions more effective than others? To address this, a quantitative evaluation of question-generation models is essential. Video question generation (VQG) is a topic for video question answering (VideoQA), where questions are generated for given answers. Their evaluation typically focuses on the ability to answer questions, rather than the quality of generated questions. In contrast, we focus on the question quality in eliciting unseen knowledge from human experts. For a continuous improvement of VQG models, we propose a protocol that evaluates the ability by simulating question-answering communication with experts using a question-to-answer retrieval. We obtain the retriever by constructing a novel dataset, EgoExoAsk, which comprises 27,666 QA pairs generated from Ego-Exo4D's expert commentary annotation. The EgoExoAsk training set is used to obtain the retriever, and the benchmark is constructed on the validation set with Ego-Exo4D video segments. Experimental results demonstrate our metric reasonably aligns with question generation settings: models accessing richer context are evaluated better, supporting that our protocol works as intended.

Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning. This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs. Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE). PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs. This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results. To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal. Extensive experimental results on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our proposed PPPO outperforms representative RLVR methods, with the accuracy improvements of 18.02% on only 26.17% training tokens."}

More recent video-based SR approaches attempt to address this limitation but require strictly sequential frames, limiting their applicability to unstructured multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce Multi-View Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting Super-Resolution (MVGSR), a framework that focuses on integrating multi-view information for 3DGS rendering with high-frequency details and enhanced consistency.

Furthermore, we introduce, for the first time, an epipolar-constrained multi-view attention mechanism into 3DGS SR, which serves as the core of our proposed multi-view SR network. This design enables the model to selectively aggregate consistent information from auxiliary views, enhancing the geometric consistency and detail fidelity of 3DGS representations.

We focus on four key subtasks: event type classification (identifying synthesis steps), trigger text identification (locating event mentions), argument role extraction (recognizing parameter types), and argument text extraction (extracting parameter values). We evaluate four prompting strategies - zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, and reflection-based - across six state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma-3-12b-it, GPT-5-mini, O4-mini, Claude-Haiku-3.5, DeepSeek reasoning and non-reasoning) using the ZSEE dataset of 1,530 annotated sentences. Results demonstrate strong performance on event type classification (80-90\\% F1) but modest performance on fine-grained extraction tasks, particularly argument role and argument text extraction (50-65\\% F1). GPT-5-mini exhibits extreme prompt sensitivity with 11-79\\% F1 variation. Notably, advanced prompting strategies provide minimal improvements over zero-shot approaches, revealing fundamental architectural limitations. Error analysis identifies systematic hallucination, over-generalization, and inability to capture synthesis-specific nuances.

Then, LED markers are extracted from the event stream after differentiating between motion-induced events and events from LED blinking, which enables the extraction of high-speed moving LED markers. Ultimately, high-frequency planar deformations are measured by a monocular event camera. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of our method in measuring high-frequency planar deformations."}

High-fidelity lesion area and target organ segmentation constitutes a key component of the computer-assisted surgery workflow. The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics. In particular, our method can more accurately segment small thyroid nodules, demonstrating its effectiveness for cases involving small ultrasound objects in long video.

Three Chinese-capable open-source LLMs (Baichuan2-7B-Chat, ChatGLM-4-9B-Chat and Llama-3-8B-Chinese-Chat-v2) were fine-tuned on this corpus and were named as MI-LLMs. We evaluated MI-LLMs using round-based automatic metrics and expert manual coding with the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding Manual 4.2.1. Results: Across all three models, fine-tuning substantially improved BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores compared with the base models, and manual coding showed that MI-LLMs achieved technical and relational global scores, and MI-adherent ratios that approached those of real MI dialogues, although complex reflections and reflection-to-question ratios remained less frequent. Conclusions: These findings provide initial evidence that MI-oriented fine-tuning can endow general-purpose LLMs with core MI-consistent counseling behaviors, suggesting a scalable pathway toward AI-assisted health behavior change support while underscoring the need for further work on data scale, complex MI skills and real-world intervention trials."}

Recent AIGC-based approaches partially automate asset creation and rigging, but they either inherit the heavy costs of full 3D pipelines or rely on video-synthesis paradigms that sacrifice 3D controllability and interactivity. We focus on single-image 3D animation generation and argue that progress is fundamentally constrained by a trade-off between rendering quality and 3D control.\n  To address this limitation, we propose a lightweight 3D animation framework that decouples geometric control from appearance synthesis. The core idea is a 2D-3D aligned proxy representation that uses a coarse 3D estimate as a structural carrier, while delegating high-fidelity appearance and view synthesis to learned image-space generative priors. This proxy formulation enables 3D-aware motion control and interaction comparable to classical pipelines, without requiring accurate geometry or expensive optimization, and naturally extends to coherent background animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves efficient animation generation on low-power platforms and outperforms video-based 3D animation generation in identity preservation, geometric and textural consistency, and the level of precise, interactive control it offers to users."}

The key challenge lies in disentangling what information should be borrowed from the reference, and determining how to apply it appropriately to the target. To tackle this challenge, we propose GENIE, a Generalizable Instance Editing framework capable of achieving explicit disentanglement. GENIE first corrects spatial misalignments with a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM). Then, an Adaptive Residual Scaling Module (ARSM) learns what to borrow by amplifying salient intrinsic cues while suppressing extrinsic attributes, while a Progressive Attention Fusion (PAF) mechanism learns how to render this appearance onto the target, preserving its structure. Extensive experiments on the challenging AnyInsertion dataset demonstrate that GENIE achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and robustness, setting a new standard for disentanglement-based instance editing."}

However, long contexts pose significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory overhead from Key-Value (KV) cache and increased latency due to excessive memory accesses. Recent methods for dynamic KV selection struggle with trade-offs: block-level indexing degrades accuracy by retrieving irrelevant KV entries, while token-level indexing incurs high latency from inefficient retrieval mechanisms. In this paper, we propose CTKVR, a novel centroid-then-token KV retrieval scheme that addresses these limitations. CTKVR leverages a key observation: query vectors adjacent in position exhibit high similarity after Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and share most of their top-k KV cache entries. Based on this insight, CTKVR employs a two-stage retrieval strategy: lightweight centroids are precomputed during prefilling for centroid-grained indexing, followed by token-level refinement for precise KV retrieval. This approach balances retrieval efficiency and accuracy. To further enhance performance, we implement an optimized system for indexing construction and search using CPU-GPU co-execution. Experimentally, CTKVR achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks with less than 1% accuracy degradation. Meanwhile, CTKVR delivers 3 times and 4 times throughput speedups on Llama-3-8B and Yi-9B at 96K context length across diverse GPU hardware."}

However, current video understanding methods are mainly concerned with what and where the action is, which is unable to meet the requirements. Meanwhile, most of the existing datasets lack the labels indicating the degree of action standardization, and the action quality assessment datasets lack explainability and detailed feedback. Therefore, we define a new Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task, and introduce a new diverse dataset CoT-AFA, which contains a large scale of fitness and martial arts videos with multi-level annotations for comprehensive video analysis. We enrich the CoT-AFA dataset with a novel Chain-of-Thought explanation paradigm. Instead of offering isolated feedback, our explanations provide a complete reasoning process--from identifying an action step to analyzing its outcome and proposing a concrete solution. Furthermore, we propose a framework named Explainable Fitness Assessor, which can not only judge an action but also explain why and provide a solution. This framework employs two parallel processing streams and a dynamic gating mechanism to fuse visual and semantic information, thereby boosting its analytical capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has achieved improvements in explanation generation (e.g., +16.0% in CIDEr), action classification (+2.7% in accuracy) and quality assessment (+2.1% in accuracy), revealing great potential of CoT-AFA for future studies.

We study the learnability of a system of verbal inflection classes by the individual language user by performing unsupervised clustering of lexemes into inflection classes. As a cognitively plausible and interpretable computational model, we use Adaptive Resonance Theory, a neural network with a parameter that determines the degree of generalisation (vigilance). The model is applied to Latin, Portuguese and Estonian. The similarity of clustering to attested inflection classes varies depending on the complexity of the inflectional system. We find the best performance in a narrow region of the generalisation parameter. The learned features extracted from the model show similarity with linguistic descriptions of the inflection classes. The proposed model could be used to study change in inflection classes in the future, by including it in an agent-based model."}

To address these issues, we present EagleVision, a dual-stage framework for progressive spatial cognition through macro perception and micro verification. In the macro perception stage, EagleVision employs a semantics-perspective-fusion determinantal point process (SPF-DPP) to select a compact set of geometry- and semantics-aware keyframes from long videos under a fixed token budget. In the micro verification stage, we formalize spatial CoT as BEV-grounded pose querying: the agent iteratively predicts poses on a BEV plane, retrieves the nearest real frames, and is trained purely by reinforcement learning with a spatial grounding reward that scores the consistency between predicted poses and observed views. On VSI-Bench, EagleVision achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source vision-language models, demonstrating strong and generalizable spatial understanding."}

The SWL's that we created using our model outperformed the industry standard, reaching the 95% coverage required for language comprehension with fewer words comparatively.

However, the substantial scale difference between transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image features at the nanoscale and optical microscopy (OM) or immunofluorescence microscopy (IM) images at the microscale poses a challenge for existing multi-modal and multi-scale models in achieving effective feature fusion and improving classification accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a cross-modal ultra-scale learning network (CMUS-Net) for the auxiliary diagnosis of multiple glomerular diseases. CMUS-Net utilizes multiple ultrastructural information to bridge the scale difference between nanometer and micrometer images. Specifically, we introduce a sparse multi-instance learning module to aggregate features from TEM images. Furthermore, we design a cross-modal scale attention module to facilitate feature interaction, enhancing pathological semantic information. Finally, multiple loss functions are combined, allowing the model to weigh the importance among different modalities and achieve precise classification of glomerular diseases. Our method follows the conventional process of renal biopsy pathology diagnosis and, for the first time, performs automatic classification of multiple glomerular diseases including IgA nephropathy (IgAN), membranous nephropathy (MN), and lupus nephritis (LN) based on images from three modalities and two scales. On an in-house dataset, CMUS-Net achieves an ACC of 95.37+/-2.41%, an AUC of 99.05+/-0.53%, and an F1-score of 95.32+/-2.41%.

Many of the inherent difficulties in these tasks stem from Multi-word Expressions (MWEs), which complicate the tasks by introducing ambiguity, idiomatic expressions, infrequent usage, and a wide range of variations. Significant effort and substantial progress have been made in addressing the challenging nature of MWEs in Western languages, particularly English. This progress is attributed in part to the well-established research communities and the abundant availability of computational resources. However, the same level of progress is not true for language families such as Chinese and closely related Asian languages, which continue to lag behind in this regard. While sub-word modelling has been successfully applied to many Western languages to address rare words improving phrase comprehension, and enhancing machine translation (MT) through techniques like byte-pair encoding (BPE), it cannot be applied directly to ideograph language scripts like Chinese. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the Chinese character decomposition technology in the context of MWE-aware neural machine translation (NMT). Furthermore, we report experiments to examine how Chinese character decomposition technology contributes to the representation of the original meanings of Chinese words and characters, and how it can effectively address the challenges of translating MWEs."}

This paper presents the first in-depth analysis of criticality metrics for safety evaluation of object detection systems. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify and assess a range of applicable metrics. Their effectiveness is empirically validated using the DeepAccident dataset, which features a variety of safety-critical scenarios.

In contrast to prior research on byte-level LMs, which focuses predominantly on training from scratch, we train Bolmo by byteifying existing subword-level LMs. Byteification enables overcoming the limitations of subword tokenization - such as insufficient character understanding and efficiency constraints due to the fixed subword vocabulary - while performing at the level of leading subword-level LMs. Bolmo is specifically designed for byteification: our architecture resolves a mismatch between the expressivity of prior byte-level architectures and subword-level LMs, which makes it possible to employ an effective exact distillation objective between Bolmo and the source subword model. This allows for converting a subword-level LM to a byte-level LM by investing less than 1\\% of a typical pretraining token budget. Bolmo substantially outperforms all prior byte-level LMs of comparable size, and outperforms the source subword-level LMs on character understanding and, in some cases, coding, while coming close to matching the original LMs' performance on other tasks. Furthermore, we show that Bolmo can achieve inference speeds competitive with subword-level LMs by training with higher token compression ratios, and can be cheaply and effectively post-trained by leveraging the existing ecosystem around the source subword-level LM. Our results finally make byte-level LMs a practical choice competitive with subword-level LMs across a wide set of use cases."}

To address these limitations, we propose a resynthesis framework to determine if a sample is authentic or if its authenticity can be plausibly denied. We make two key contributions focusing on the high-precision, low-recall setting against efficient (i.e., compute-restricted) adversaries. First, we demonstrate that our calibrated resynthesis method is the most reliable approach for verifying authentic samples while maintaining controllable, low FPRs. Second, we show that our method achieves adversarial robustness against efficient adversaries, whereas prior methods are easily evaded under identical compute budgets. Our approach supports multiple modalities and leverages state-of-the-art inversion techniques."}

For example, triaging post-operative care to patients based on hospital referral letters, or updating site access schedules in nuclear facilities for work crews. If we want to introduce LLMs into critical information flows that were previously performed by humans, how can we make them safe and reliable? Rather than make performative claims about augmented generation frameworks or graph-based techniques, this paper argues that the safety argument should focus on the type of evidence we get from evaluation points in LLM processes, particularly in frameworks that employ LLM-as-Judges (LaJ) evaluators. This paper argues that although we cannot get deterministic evaluations from many natural language processing tasks, by adopting a basket of weighted metrics it may be possible to lower the risk of errors within an evaluation, use context sensitivity to define error severity and design confidence thresholds that trigger human review of critical LaJ judgments when concordance across evaluators is low."}

To address this challenge, we propose Mesh-Plug, a plug-and-play module that accurately transforms human meshes from camera coordinates to world coordinates. Our key innovation lies in a human-centered approach that leverages both RGB images and depth maps rendered from the initial mesh to estimate camera rotation parameters, eliminating the dependency on environmental cues. Specifically, we first train a camera rotation prediction module that focuses on the human body's spatial configuration to estimate camera pitch angle. Then, by integrating the predicted camera parameters with the initial mesh, we design a mesh adjustment module that simultaneously refines the root joint orientation and body pose.

Oral Presentation", "summary": "State space models (SSMs) are a promising alternative to transformers for language modeling because they use fixed memory during inference. However, this fixed memory usage requires some information loss in the hidden state when processing long sequences. While prior work has studied the sequence length at which this information loss occurs, it does not characterize the types of information SSM language models (LMs) tend to forget. In this paper, we address this knowledge gap by identifying the types of tokens (e.g., parts of speech, named entities) and sequences (e.g., code, math problems) that are more frequently forgotten by SSM LMs. We achieve this by training an auto-encoder to reconstruct sequences from the SSM's hidden state, and measure information loss by comparing inputs with their reconstructions. We perform experiments using the Mamba family of SSM LMs (130M--1.4B) on sequences ranging from 4--256 tokens. Our results show significantly higher rates of information loss on math-related tokens (e.g., numbers, variables), mentions of organization entities, and alternative dialects to Standard American English. We then examine the frequency that these tokens appear in Mamba's pretraining data and find that less prevalent tokens tend to be the ones Mamba is most likely to forget. By identifying these patterns, our work provides clear direction for future research to develop methods that better control Mamba's ability to retain important information."}

However, existing methods usually fail to effectively address nonuniform scattered flares, which severely reduces their applicability to complex real-world scenarios with diverse lighting conditions. To address this issue, we propose SLCFormer, a novel spectral-local context transformer framework for effective nighttime lens flare removal. SLCFormer integrates two key modules: the Frequency Fourier and Excitation Module (FFEM), which captures efficient global contextual representations in the frequency domain to model flare characteristics, and the Directionally-Enhanced Spatial Module (DESM) for local structural enhancement and directional features in the spatial domain for precise flare removal. Furthermore, we introduce a ZernikeVAE-based scatter flare generation pipeline to synthesize physically realistic scatter flares with spatially varying PSFs, bridging optical physics and data-driven training. Extensive experiments on the Flare7K++ dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing approaches in both quantitative metrics and perceptual visual quality, and generalizing robustly to real nighttime scenes with complex flare artifacts."}

In this paper, we introduce PPSEBM, a novel framework that integrates an Energy-Based Model (EBM) with Progressive Parameter Selection (PPS) to effectively address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for natural language processing tasks. In PPSEBM, progressive parameter selection allocates distinct, task-specific parameters for each new task, while the EBM generates representative pseudo-samples from prior tasks. These generated samples actively inform and guide the parameter selection process, enhancing the model's ability to retain past knowledge while adapting to new tasks.

Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4. These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations."}

Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $Δ$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $Δ$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline). This establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and can perform equitably across diverse patient subgroups, ensuring reliable performance without increasing privacy risks."}

To achieve this, we recruited human labelers to identify online harassment in an Instagram messages dataset.

In this study, we therefore systematically compare the performance of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets, as well as on a novel benchmark specifically created to have a finer-grained control over the visual properties of test images. Our findings show that most VLMs can approximately enumerate the number of items in a visual scene, matching or even surpassing the performance of specialized computer vision architectures. Notably, enumeration accuracy significantly improves when VLMs are prompted to generate intermediate representations (i.e., locations and verbal labels) of each object to be counted. Nevertheless, none of the models can reliably count the number of objects in complex visual scenes, showing that further research is still needed to create AI systems that can reliably deploy counting procedures in realistic environments."}

To achieve effective fusion, it is crucial to fully exploit the complementary information between the two modalities. Traditional CNN-based methods typically rely on channel-wise concatenation with fixed convolutional operators, which limits their adaptability to diverse spatial and spectral variations. While cross-attention mechanisms enable global interactions, they are computationally inefficient and may dilute fine-grained correspondences, making it difficult to capture complex semantic relationships. Recent advances in the Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture have demonstrated impressive success in image generation and editing tasks. Unlike cross-attention, MMDiT employs in-context conditioning to facilitate more direct and efficient cross-modal information exchange. In this paper, we propose MMMamba, a cross-modal in-context fusion framework for pan-sharpening, with the flexibility to support image super-resolution in a zero-shot manner. Built upon the Mamba architecture, our design ensures linear computational complexity while maintaining strong cross-modal interaction capacity.

We initially hypothesized that a novel Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network -- termed SepsisFusionFormer -- would resolve complex cross-modal interactions between vitals, text, and imaging. However, experiments on MIMIC-IV revealed that SepsisFusionFormer suffered from \"attention starvation\" in the small antibiotic cohort ($N \\approx 2,100$), resulting in overfitting (AUC 0.66). This counterintuitive result informed the design of SepsisLateFusion, a \"leaner\" Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.

By calibrating the decision threshold for clinical safety, we reduced missed cases by 48% relative to the default operating point, thus opening a true preventative window for timely intervention over reactive alerts.

SynthSeg Agents comprises two key modules, a Self Refine Prompt Agent and an Image Generation Agent.

This study proposes a Prototypical Learning Guided Context-Aware Segmentation Network (PCSNet) to address the domain gap, thereby improving feature descriptiveness in target scenarios and enhancing FSAD performance. In particular, PCSNet comprises a prototypical feature adaption (PFA) sub-network and a context-aware segmentation (CAS) sub-network. PFA extracts prototypical features as guidance to ensure better feature compactness for normal data while distinct separation from anomalies. A pixel-level disparity classification loss is also designed to make subtle anomalies more distinguishable. Then a CAS sub-network is introduced for pixel-level anomaly localization, where pseudo anomalies are exploited to facilitate the training process. Experimental results on MVTec and MPDD demonstrate the superior FSAD performance of PCSNet, with 94.9% and 80.2% image-level AUROC in an 8-shot scenario, respectively.

However, a major drawback of this scheme is its tendency to overly generalize, primarily due to the similarities between input and supervisory signals. In order to address this issue, this paper introduces a novel technique called masked reverse knowledge distillation (MRKD). By employing image-level masking (ILM) and feature-level masking (FLM), MRKD transforms the task of image reconstruction into image restoration. Specifically, ILM helps to capture global information by differentiating input signals from supervisory signals. On the other hand, FLM incorporates synthetic feature-level anomalies to ensure that the learned representations contain sufficient local information. With these two strategies, MRKD is endowed with stronger image context capture capacity and is less likely to be overgeneralized. Experiments on the widely-used MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that MRKD achieves impressive performance: image-level 98.9% AU-ROC, pixel-level 98.4% AU-ROC, and 95.3% AU-PRO. In addition, extensive ablation experiments have validated the superiority of MRKD in mitigating the overgeneralization problem."}

For a robot to work with complete autonomy in a Laboratory environment, it needs to have some basic skills like navigation, handling objects, preparing samples etc. to match human-like capabilities in an unstructured environment. Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale.

To make the system efficient and robust, the area of interest is reduced to just the linear scale containing part of the image. After that, a series of features were extracted like the major makers, the corresponding digits, and the level indicator location, from which the final reading was calculated. Readings obtained using this system were also compared against human read values of the same instances and an accurate correspondence was observed."}

We present TIMAR (Turn-level Interleaved Masked AutoRegression), a causal framework for 3D conversational head generation that models dialogue as interleaved audio-visual contexts. It fuses multimodal information within each turn and applies turn-level causal attention to accumulate conversational history, while a lightweight diffusion head predicts continuous 3D head dynamics that captures both coordination and expressive variability.

Embodied navigation, as a crucial component of such capabilities, leverages the compact and expressive nature of 3DSGs to enable long-horizon reasoning and planning in complex, large-scale environments. However, prior works rely on a static-world assumption, defining traversable space solely based on static spatial layouts and thereby treating interactable obstacles as non-traversable. This fundamental limitation severely undermines their effectiveness in real-world scenarios, leading to limited reachability, low efficiency, and inferior extensibility. To address these issues, we propose HERO, a novel framework for constructing Hierarchical Traversable 3DSGs, that redefines traversability by modeling operable obstacles as pathways, capturing their physical interactivity, functional semantics, and the scene's relational hierarchy. The results show that, relative to its baseline, HERO reduces PL by 35.1% in partially obstructed environments and increases SR by 79.4% in fully obstructed ones, demonstrating substantially higher efficiency and reachability."}

First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an \"Expand-and-Prune\" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs.

Using calibration sets of approximately 600 examples, we achieve 94% coverage with 0% false positive rate on synthetic hallucinations (Natural Questions). However, on three real hallucination benchmarks spanning multiple LLMs (GPT-4, ChatGPT, GPT-3, Llama-2, Mistral), embedding-based methods - including state-of-the-art OpenAI text-embedding-3-large and cross-encoder models - exhibit unacceptable false positive rates: 100% on HaluEval, 88% on RAGTruth, and 50% on WikiBio.

A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) service is instantiated using the DeepSeek-R1 model over a corpus containing synthetic personally identifiable information (PII), and subjected to automated attacks with Garak across five vulnerability classes: PII leakage, latent context injection, prompt injection, adversarial attack generation, and divergence. For each (vulnerability, control) pair, attack success probabilities are estimated via Laplace's Rule of Succession and combined with loss triangle distributions, calibrated from public breach-cost data, in 10,000-run Monte Carlo simulations to produce loss exceedance curves and expected losses. Three widely used mitigations, attribute-based access control (ABAC); named entity recognition (NER) redaction using Microsoft Presidio; and NeMo Guardrails, are then compared to a baseline RAG configuration. The baseline system exhibits very high attack success rates (>= 0.98 for PII, latent injection, and prompt injection), yielding a total simulated expected loss of $313k per attack scenario. ABAC collapses success probabilities for PII and prompt-related attacks to near zero and reduces the total expected loss by ~94%, achieving an RoC of 9.83.

The quality of these concept representations is typically evaluated in isolation, and under implicit independence assumptions that may not hold in practice. Thus, it is unclear whether common featurization methods - including sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and sparse probes - recover disentangled representations of these concepts. This study proposes a multi-concept evaluation setting where we control the correlations between textual concepts, such as sentiment, domain, and tense, and analyze performance under increasing correlations between them. We first evaluate the extent to which featurizers can learn disentangled representations of each concept under increasing correlational strengths. We observe a one-to-many relationship from concepts to features: features correspond to no more than one concept, but concepts are distributed across many features. Then, we perform steering experiments, measuring whether each concept is independently manipulable. Even when trained on uniform distributions of concepts, SAE features generally affect many concepts when steered, indicating that they are neither selective nor independent; nonetheless, features affect disjoint subspaces. These results suggest that correlational metrics for measuring disentanglement are generally not sufficient for establishing independence when steering, and that affecting disjoint subspaces is not sufficient for concept selectivity. These results underscore the importance of compositional evaluations in interpretability research."}

However, most existing PVC methods fail to leverage unaligned data to capture the shared semantics among samples from the same cluster.

However, analyzing such time-varying sets of vectors is challenging due to their complicated structures, which also evolve over time. In this work, we propose a novel method for modeling the distribution underlying each set of vectors using infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes.

However, the impact of this high information density on the core long-context capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) remains under-investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for VTC and systematically assess the performance of VLMs across three long-context understanding settings: VTC-Retrieval, which evaluates the model's ability to retrieve and aggregate information; VTC-Reasoning, which requires models to infer latent associations to locate facts with minimal lexical overlap; and VTC-Memory, which measures comprehensive question answering within long-term dialogue memory. Furthermore, we establish the VTCBench-Wild to simulate diverse input scenarios.We comprehensively evaluate leading open-source and proprietary models on our benchmarks. The results indicate that, despite being able to decode textual information (e.g., OCR) well, most VLMs exhibit a surprisingly poor long-context understanding ability with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in the context.This study provides a deep understanding of VTC and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs."}

We introduce a self-evolving training pipeline powered by the Calibrated Step Reward System, which converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals through trajectory-level calibration, achieving >90% annotation accuracy with 10-100x lower cost. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce Step-GUI, a family of models (4B/8B) that achieves state-of-the-art GUI performance (8B: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro) while maintaining robust general capabilities.

Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models.

To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph. Across multiple models, datasets, metrics, and methods, CAGE improves context attribution faithfulness, achieving average gains of up to 40%."}

Once leaked, these templates pose a threat: inverting them can yield photorealistic surrogates that compromise privacy and enable impersonation. Although existing research has achieved relatively realistic face template inversion, the reconstructed facial images exhibit over-smoothed facial-part attributes (eyes, nose, mouth) and limited transferability. To address this problem, we present CLIP-FTI, a CLIP-driven fine-grained attribute conditioning framework for face template inversion. Our core idea is to use the CLIP model to obtain the semantic embeddings of facial features, in order to realize the reconstruction of specific facial feature attributes. Specifically, facial feature attribute embeddings extracted from CLIP are fused with the leaked template via a cross-modal feature interaction network and projected into the intermediate latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN. The StyleGAN generator then synthesizes face images with the same identity as the templates but with more fine-grained facial feature attributes. Experiments across multiple face recognition backbones and datasets show that our reconstructions (i) achieve higher identification accuracy and attribute similarity, (ii) recover sharper component-level attribute semantics, and (iii) improve cross-model attack transferability compared to prior reconstruction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first method to use additional information besides the face template attack to realize face template inversion and obtains SOTA results."}

Specifically, an encoder compresses activations to a sparse list of concepts, and a decoder reads this list and answers a natural language question about the model. We show how to pretrain this assistant on large unstructured data, then finetune it to answer questions. The resulting architecture, which we call a Predictive Concept Decoder, enjoys favorable scaling properties: the auto-interp score of the bottleneck concepts improves with data, as does the performance on downstream applications. Specifically, PCDs can detect jailbreaks, secret hints, and implanted latent concepts, and are able to accurately surface latent user attributes."}

Our architecture integrates a spatial decoder, which leverages geometric priors such as position and angle for early-stage tracking, with a temporal decoder that exploits motion consistency to resolve late-stage occlusions. Crucially, an adaptive gating mechanism dynamically shifts reliance between these spatial and temporal cues, while a biological constraint based on negative gravitropism mitigates vertical growth ambiguities. Validated on a Brassica napus dataset, ST-DETrack achieves a Branch Matching Accuracy (BMA) of 93.6%, significantly outperforming spatial and temporal baselines by 28.9 and 3.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate the method's robustness in maintaining long-term identity consistency amidst complex, dynamic plant architectures."}

This study investigates the effectiveness of two individual deep learning architectures ResNet-101 and Inception v3 for wildlife object detection under such complex conditions. The models were trained and evaluated on a wildlife image dataset using a standardized preprocessing approach, which included resizing images to a maximum dimension of 800 pixels, converting them to RGB format, and transforming them into PyTorch tensors. A ratio of 70:30 training and validation split was used for model development. The ResNet-101 model achieved a classification accuracy of 94% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91, showing strong performance in extracting deep hierarchical features. The Inception v3 model performed slightly better, attaining a classification accuracy of 95% and a mAP of 0.92, attributed to its efficient multi-scale feature extraction through parallel convolutions. Despite the strong results, both models exhibited challenges when detecting species with similar visual characteristics or those captured under poor lighting and occlusion. Nonetheless, the findings confirm that both ResNet-101 and Inception v3 are effective models for wildlife object detection tasks and provide a reliable foundation for conservation-focused computer vision applications."}

Multi-view learning-based approaches mitigate these issues but often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios, as large-scale multi-view datasets with 3D ground truth are scarce and captured under constrained conditions. To overcome this limitation, recent methods rely on 2D pose estimation combined with 2D-to-3D pose lifting trained on synthetic data. Building on our previous MPL framework, we propose RUMPL, a transformer-based 3D pose lifter that introduces a 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints. This formulation makes the model independent of camera calibration and the number of views, enabling universal deployment across arbitrary multi-view configurations without retraining or fine-tuning. A new View Fusion Transformer leverages learned fused-ray tokens to aggregate information along rays, further improving multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RUMPL reduces MPJPE by up to 53% compared to triangulation and over 60% compared to transformer-based image-representation baselines. Results on new benchmarks, including in-the-wild multi-view and multi-person datasets, confirm its robustness and scalability.

While the challenge demonstrates that modern deep learning methods achieve competitive accuracy on T1-weighted MRI, it also claims exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen contrasts and resolutions, assertions that contradict established understanding of domain shift in deep learning. In this paper, we perform an independent re-evaluation of these zero-shot claims using rigorous evaluation protocols while addressing potential sources of instrumentation bias. Our findings reveal a more nuanced picture: (1) deep learning methods perform comparably to iterative optimization on in-distribution T1w images and even on human-adjacent species (macaque), demonstrating improved task understanding; (2) however, performance degrades significantly on out-of-distribution contrasts (T2, T2*, FLAIR), with Cohen's d scores ranging from 0.7-1.5, indicating substantial practical impact on downstream clinical workflows; (3) deep learning methods face scalability limitations on high-resolution data, failing to run on 0.6 mm isotropic images, while iterative methods benefit from increased resolution; and (4) deep methods exhibit high sensitivity to preprocessing choices. These results align with the well-established literature on domain shift and suggest that claims of universal zero-shot superiority require careful scrutiny. We advocate for evaluation protocols that reflect practical clinical and research workflows rather than conditions that may inadvertently favor particular method classes."}

Inspired by keypoint detection, our multi-resolution decoder learns to distribute primitives across image patches. This module is trained end-to-end with a 3D reconstruction backbone using self-supervised learning. Our resulting pose-free model generates photorealistic scenes in seconds, achieving state-of-the-art novel view synthesis for feed-forward models.

To address this, we propose DeX-Portrait, a novel approach capable of generating expressive portrait animation driven by disentangled pose and expression signals. Specifically, we represent the pose as an explicit global transformation and the expression as an implicit latent code. First, we design a powerful motion trainer to learn both pose and expression encoders for extracting precise and decomposed driving signals. Then we propose to inject the pose transformation into the diffusion model through a dual-branch conditioning mechanism, and the expression latent through cross attention. Finally, we design a progressive hybrid classifier-free guidance for more faithful identity consistency.

In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC. Through fair and comprehensive evaluations on the unified benchmark VECBench, EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation.

However, the cost of using and training LVLMs is high, due to the large number of parameters. While multiple parameter-efficient adaptation techniques have been explored, the computational costs of training and inference with these models can remain prohibitive for most institutions. In this work, we explore the use of encoder-only architectures and propose a model that can effectively address multi-task learning while remaining compact in terms of the number of parameters. In particular, our model tackles combinations of tasks that are not typically explored in a unified model: the generation of text from remote sensing images and cross-modal retrieval.

To address these issues, we introduce GRAN-TED, a paradigm to Generate Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embeddings for Diffusion models. Our contribution is twofold.

This motivates effective adaptation under limited supervision. SAM3 concept-driven framework generates masks from textual prompts without requiring task-specific modifications, which may enable this adaptation. We evaluate SAM3 for RS imagery across four target types, comparing textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies, under lightweight fine-tuning scales with increasing supervision, alongside zero-shot inference. Results show that combining semantic and geometric cues yields the highest performance across targets and metrics. Text-only prompting exhibits the lowest performance, with marked score gaps for irregularly shaped targets, reflecting limited semantic alignment between SAM3 textual representations and their overhead appearances. Nevertheless, textual prompting with light fine-tuning offers a practical performance-effort trade-off for geometrically regular and visually salient targets. Across targets, performance improves between zero-shot inference and fine-tuning, followed by diminishing returns as the supervision scale increases. Namely, a modest geometric annotation effort is sufficient for effective adaptation. A persistent gap between Precision and IoU further indicates that under-segmentation and boundary inaccuracies remain prevalent error patterns in RS tasks, particularly for irregular and less prevalent targets."}

IMKD applies a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy to enrich the fused representation across the architecture: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar representations with fine-grained structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused feature intensity-guided distillation to selectively highlight useful geometry and depth information at the fusion level, fostering complementarity between the modalities rather than forcing them to align, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism that facilitates effective feature alignment and calibration. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that IMKD reaches 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods.

A core challenge lies in the limited availability of multi-view data and the tendency of monocular training to yield incomplete 3D head reconstructions. We identify the root cause of this issue as the entanglement between driving signal and target viewpoint when learning from monocular videos. To address this, we propose a transformer-based 3D portrait animation model with learnable data source tokens, so-called bias sinks, which enables unified training across monocular and multi-view datasets. This design leverages the strengths of both data sources during inference: strong generalization from monocular data and full 3D completeness from multi-view supervision. Furthermore, our training procedure yields a smooth latent avatar space that facilitates identity interpolation and flexible fitting to an arbitrary number of input observations. In extensive evaluations on single-view, few-shot, and monocular avatar creation tasks, we verify the efficacy of FlexAvatar. Many existing methods struggle with view extrapolation while FlexAvatar generates complete 3D head avatars with realistic facial animations.

In contrast, professional design tools employ layered representations, allowing isolated edits while preserving consistency.

To support variable-length decomposition, we introduce three key components: (1) an RGBA-VAE to unify the latent representations of RGB and RGBA images; (2) a VLD-MMDiT (Variable Layers Decomposition MMDiT) architecture capable of decomposing a variable number of image layers; and (3) a Multi-stage Training strategy to adapt a pretrained image generation model into a multilayer image decomposer.

In this paper, we introduce a robust method for pose estimation and calibration. We consider a set of rigid cameras, each observing the scene from a different perspective, which is a typical camera setup in animal behavior studies and forensic analysis of surveillance footage. Specifically, we analyse the individual components in a structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline, and identify design choices that improve accuracy. Our main contributions are: (1) we investigate how to best subsample the predicted correspondences from a dense matcher to leverage them in the estimation process. (2) We investigate selection criteria for how to add the views incrementally. In a rigorous quantitative evaluation, we show the effectiveness of our changes, especially for cameras with strong radial distortion (79.9% ours vs. 40.4 vanilla VGGT). Finally, we demonstrate our correspondence subsampling in a global SfM setting where we initialize the poses using VGGT. The proposed pipeline generalizes across a wide range of camera setups, and could thus become a useful tool for animal behavior and forensic analysis."}

Space-based sensing will enable inspection of RSOs at shorter ranges, independent of atmospheric effects, and from all aspects. The use of a sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging and sensing system for SDA has been proposed in previous work, demonstrating the achievement of sub-cm image resolution at ranges of up to 100 km. This work focuses on recognition of external structures by use of sequential feature detection and tracking throughout the aligned ISAR images of the satellites. The Hough transform is employed to detect linear features, which are tracked throughout the sequence. ISAR imagery is generated via a metaheuristic simulator capable of modelling encounters for a variety of deployment scenarios. Initial frame-to-frame alignment is achieved through a series of affine transformations to facilitate later association between image features. A gradient-by-ratio method is used for edge detection within individual ISAR images, and edge magnitude and direction are subsequently used to inform a double-weighted Hough transform to detect features with high accuracy. Feature evolution during sequences of frames is analysed. It is shown that the use of feature tracking within sequences with the proposed approach will increase confidence in feature detection and classification, and an example use-case of robust detection of shadowing as a feature is presented."}

They enable captivating visual arts, immersive virtual reality, and a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. Recent works have extended sky-models to be more comprehensive and inclusive of cloud formations but, as we demonstrate, existing methods fall short in faithfully recreating natural skies. Though in recent years the visual quality of DNN-generated High Dynamic Range Imagery (HDRI) has greatly improved, the environment maps generated by DNN sky-models do not re-light scenes with the same tones, shadows, and illumination as physically captured HDR imagery. In this work, we demonstrate progress in HDR literature to be tangential to sky-modelling as current works cannot support both photorealism and the 22 f-stops required for the Full Dynamic Range (FDR) of outdoor illumination. We achieve this by proposing AllSky, a flexible all-weather sky-model learned directly from physically captured HDRI which we leverage to study the input modalities, tonemapping, conditioning, and evaluation of sky-models. Per user-controlled positioning of the sun and cloud formations, AllSky expands on current functionality by allowing for intuitive user control over environment maps and achieves state-of-the-art sky-model performance.

However, existing video editing models fail to satisfy these requirements. IC-Effect leverages the source video as clean contextual conditions, exploiting the contextual learning capability of DiT models to achieve precise background preservation and natural effect injection. A two-stage training strategy, consisting of general editing adaptation followed by effect-specific learning via Effect-LoRA, ensures strong instruction following and robust effect modeling. To further improve efficiency, we introduce spatiotemporal sparse tokenization, enabling high fidelity with substantially reduced computation.

A common challenge in current methods, however, is the occurrence of Spatial Relationship Hallucinations between the foreground subject and the generated background, including inappropriate scale, positional relationships, and viewpoints. Critically, the subjective nature of spatial rationality makes it challenging to quantify, hindering the use of traditional reward-based RLHF methods. To address this issue, we propose InpaintDPO, the first Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based framework dedicated to spatial rationality in foreground-conditioned inpainting, ensuring plausible spatial relationships between foreground and background elements. To resolve the gradient conflicts in standard DPO caused by identical foreground in win-lose pairs, we propose MaskDPO, which confines preference optimization exclusively to the background to enhance background spatial relationships, while retaining the inpainting loss in the foreground region for robust foreground preservation. To enhance coherence at the foreground-background boundary, we propose Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization, which samples pairs with differentiated cropping operations and applies global preference optimization to promote contextual awareness and enhance boundary coherence. Finally, based on the observation that winning samples share a commonality in plausible spatial relationships, we propose Shared Commonality Preference Optimization to enhance the model's understanding of spatial commonality across high-quality winning samples, further promoting shared spatial rationality."}

However, we observe that when only a limited number of crops per image are used, soft labels are prone to local semantic drift: a crop may visually resemble another class, causing its soft embedding to deviate from the ground-truth semantics of the original image. This mismatch between local visual content and global semantic meaning introduces systematic errors and distribution misalignment between training and testing. In this work, we revisit the overlooked role of hard labels and show that, when appropriately integrated, they provide a powerful content-agnostic anchor to calibrate semantic drift. We theoretically characterize the emergence of drift under few soft-label supervision and demonstrate that hybridizing soft and hard labels restores alignment between visual content and semantic supervision. Building on this insight, we propose a new training paradigm, Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift (HALD), which leverages hard labels as intermediate corrective signals while retaining the fine-grained advantages of soft labels. Extensive experiments on dataset distillation and large-scale conventional classification benchmarks validate our approach, showing consistent improvements in generalization. On ImageNet-1K, we achieve 42.7% with only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming prior state-of-the-art LPLD by 9.0%.

A noteworthy solution is vision-text compression (VTC), exemplified by frameworks like DeepSeek-OCR and Glyph, which convert long texts into dense 2D visual representations, thereby achieving token compression ratios of 3x-20x. However, the impact of this high information density on the core long-context capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) remains under-investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for VTC and systematically assess the performance of VLMs across three long-context understanding settings: VTC-Retrieval, which evaluates the model's ability to retrieve and aggregate information; VTC-Reasoning, which requires models to infer latent associations to locate facts with minimal lexical overlap; and VTC-Memory, which measures comprehensive question answering within long-term dialogue memory. Furthermore, we establish the VTCBench-Wild to simulate diverse input scenarios.We comprehensively evaluate leading open-source and proprietary models on our benchmarks. The results indicate that, despite being able to decode textual information (e.g., OCR) well, most VLMs exhibit a surprisingly poor long-context understanding ability with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in the context.This study provides a deep understanding of VTC and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs."}

In this paper, we introduce GateFusion, a novel architecture that combines strong pretrained unimodal encoders with a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate). HiGate enables progressive, multi-depth fusion by adaptively injecting contextual features from one modality into the other at multiple layers of the Transformer backbone, guided by learnable, bimodally-conditioned gates.

This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments.

The model is trained on 2B web-crawled images with a self-curation strategy with minimal human curation. Pixio performs competitively across a wide range of downstream tasks in the wild, including monocular depth estimation (e.g., Depth Anything), feed-forward 3D reconstruction (i.e., MapAnything), semantic segmentation, and robot learning, outperforming or matching DINOv3 trained at similar scales. Our results suggest that pixel-space self-supervised learning can serve as a promising alternative and a complement to latent-space approaches."}

To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatia, a spatial memory-aware video generation framework that explicitly preserves a 3D scene point cloud as persistent spatial memory. Spatia iteratively generates video clips conditioned on this spatial memory and continuously updates it through visual SLAM. This dynamic-static disentanglement design enhances spatial consistency throughout the generation process while preserving the model's ability to produce realistic dynamic entities. Furthermore, Spatia enables applications such as explicit camera control and 3D-aware interactive editing, providing a geometrically grounded framework for scalable, memory-driven video generation."}

In this work, we present a rigorous architectural comparison between End-to-End Deep Fusion and Context-Aware Stacking for sepsis tasks. We initially hypothesized that a novel Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network -- termed SepsisFusionFormer -- would resolve complex cross-modal interactions between vitals, text, and imaging. However, experiments on MIMIC-IV revealed that SepsisFusionFormer suffered from \"attention starvation\" in the small antibiotic cohort ($N \\approx 2,100$), resulting in overfitting (AUC 0.66). This counterintuitive result informed the design of SepsisLateFusion, a \"leaner\" Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. By treating modalities as orthogonal experts -- the \"Historian\" (Static), the \"Monitor\" (Temporal), and the \"Reader\" (NLP) -- and dynamically gating them via a CatBoost meta-learner, we achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance: 0.915 AUC for prediction 4 hours prior to clinical onset. By calibrating the decision threshold for clinical safety, we reduced missed cases by 48% relative to the default operating point, thus opening a true preventative window for timely intervention over reactive alerts. Furthermore, for the novel prescriptive task of multi-class antibiotic selection, we demonstrate that a Quad-Modal Ensemble achieved the highest performance (0.72 AUC).

However, prior works rely on a static-world assumption, defining traversable space solely based on static spatial layouts and thereby treating interactable obstacles as non-traversable. This fundamental limitation severely undermines their effectiveness in real-world scenarios, leading to limited reachability, low efficiency, and inferior extensibility. To address these issues, we propose HERO, a novel framework for constructing Hierarchical Traversable 3DSGs, that redefines traversability by modeling operable obstacles as pathways, capturing their physical interactivity, functional semantics, and the scene's relational hierarchy. The results show that, relative to its baseline, HERO reduces PL by 35.1% in partially obstructed environments and increases SR by 79.4% in fully obstructed ones, demonstrating substantially higher efficiency and reachability."}

Conventional performance metrics such as precision, recall and the F1-score assess the overall detection accuracy, but they do not consider the safety-relevant aspects of perception. Consequently, perception systems that achieve high scores in these metrics may still cause misdetections that could lead to severe accidents. Therefore, it is important to evaluate not only the overall performance of perception systems, but also their safety. We therefore introduce a novel safety metric for jointly evaluating the most critical perception tasks, object and lane detection. Our proposed framework integrates a new, lightweight object safety metric that quantifies the potential risk associated with object detection errors, as well as an lane safety metric including the interdependence between both tasks that can occur in safety evaluation. The resulting combined safety score provides a unified, interpretable measure of perception safety performance. Using the DeepAccident dataset, we demonstrate that our approach identifies safety critical perception errors that conventional performance metrics fail to capture. Our findings emphasize the importance of safety-centric evaluation methods for perception systems in autonomous driving."}

We propose ICAR (Image Complexity-Aware Retrieval), which enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images whilst processing complex images through their full network depth. The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both reduced-compute and full-compute processing. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead. To determine how much compute to use, we develop ConvNeXt-IC, which treats image complexity assessment as a classification task. By applying modern classifier backbones rather than specialised architectures, ConvNeXt-IC achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.959 correlation with human judgement (Pearson) and 4.4x speedup.

To overcome this limitation, we propose MiVLA, a generalizable VLA empowered by human-robot mutual imitation pre-training, which leverages inherent behavioral similarity between human hands and robotic arms to build a foundation of strong behavioral priors for both human actions and robotic control. Specifically, our method utilizes kinematic rules with left/right hand coordinate systems for bidirectional alignment between human and robot action spaces.

Based on this mutual imitation, it integrates the behavioral fidelity of real-world human data with the manipulative diversity of simulated robot data into a unified model, thereby enhancing the generalization capability for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on both simulation and real-world platforms with three robots (ARX, PiPer and LocoMan), demonstrate that MiVLA achieves strong improved generalization capability, outperforming state-of-the-art VLAs (e.g., $\\boldsymbolπ_{0}$, $\\boldsymbolπ_{0.5}$ and H-RDT) by 25% in simulation, and 14% in real-world robot control tasks."}

As a result, despite improved semantic generalization, the policy must implicitly infer complex physical dynamics and temporal dependencies solely from robot trajectories. This reliance creates an unsustainable data burden, necessitating continuous, large-scale expert data collection to compensate for the lack of innate physical understanding. We contend that while vision-language pretraining effectively captures semantic priors, it remains blind to physical causality. A more effective paradigm leverages video to jointly capture semantics and visual dynamics during pretraining, thereby isolating the remaining task of low-level control. To this end, we introduce \\model, a novel Video-Action Model (VAM) that pairs a pretrained Internet-scale video model with a flow matching-based action decoder conditioned on its latent representations. The decoder serves as an Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM), generating low-level robot actions from the latent representation of video-space action plans. Our extensive evaluation shows that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, improving sample efficiency by 10x and convergence speed by 2x compared to traditional VLA architectures."}
