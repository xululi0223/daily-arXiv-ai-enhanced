While research has\nfocused on the development of complex memory systems, it remains unclear which\ntypes of memory are most effective for long-context conversational tasks. We\npresent a systematic evaluation of memory-augmented methods using LoCoMo, a\nbenchmark of synthetic long-context dialogues annotated for question-answering\ntasks that require diverse reasoning strategies. We analyse full-context\nprompting, semantic memory through retrieval-augmented generation and agentic\nmemory, episodic memory through in-context learning, and procedural memory\nthrough prompt optimization. Our findings show that memory-augmented approaches\nreduce token usage by over 90% while maintaining competitive accuracy. Memory\narchitecture complexity should scale with model capability, with small\nfoundation models benefitting most from RAG, and strong instruction-tuned\nreasoning model gaining from episodic learning through reflections and more\ncomplex agentic semantic memory. In particular, episodic memory can help LLMs\nrecognise the limits of their own knowledge."}

Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves\nremarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to\ndownstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix.

First, it locates task-relevant weights by\ngradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during\nfine-tuning and limits the performance.

However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained\nrepresentations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability\nsimultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation\ninterpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable\nsemantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,\nonly the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas\nthe uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we\npropose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the\ninformation loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies\nthe representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation\ninterpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that\nthe interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,\nrepresentations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable\nsemantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further\nsupports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the\nclassifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with\ninterpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for\nthe representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with\nless accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and\ncorresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements\nin interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models.

Our prompt-based approach taps into the implicit relational\nstructures encoded in LLMs, providing both quantitative and qualitative\nassessments of bias. Unlike most prompt-based evaluation methods, our method\nenables direct comparisons between various LLMs and humans, providing a\nvaluable point of reference and offering new insights into the alignment of\nLLMs with human cognition. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we\napply it to both humans and several widely used LLMs to investigate social\nbiases related to gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and\npolitical party. Our results reveal both convergences and divergences between\nLLM and human biases, providing new perspectives on the potential risks of\nusing LLMs. Our methodology contributes to a systematic, scalable, and\ngeneralizable framework for evaluating and comparing biases across multiple\nLLMs and humans, advancing the goal of transparent and socially responsible\nlanguage technologies."}

However,\nwhen a word appears in a text, this ambiguity is generally much reduced.\nDisambiguating POS involves using context to reduce the number of POS\nassociated with words, and is one of the main challenges of lexical tagging.\nThe problem of labeling words by POS frequently arises in natural language\nprocessing, for example for spelling correction, grammar or style checking,\nexpression recognition, text-to-speech conversion, text corpus analysis, etc.\nLexical tagging systems are thus useful as an initial component of many natural\nlanguage processing systems. A number of recent lexical tagging systems produce\nmultiple solutions when the text is lexically ambiguous or the uniquely correct\nsolution cannot be found. These contributions aim to guarantee a zero silence\nrate: the correct tag(s) for a word must never be discarded. This objective is\nunrealistic for systems that tag each word uniquely. This article concerns a\nlexical disambiguation method adapted to the objective of a zero silence rate\nand implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system (1993).

Furthermore, when examining the initial labeling\nof a text as produced by INTEX, ideas for disambiguation rules come\nspontaneously, but grammatical intuitions may turn out to be inaccurate, often\ndue to an unforeseen construction or ambiguity.

Existing static sparse methods\nsuch as sliding windows or global tokens utilizes the sparsity of attention to\nreduce the cost of attention, but poorly adapts to the content-dependent\nvariations in attention due to their staticity. While previous work has\nproposed several dynamic approaches to improve flexibility, they still depend\non predefined templates or heuristic mechanisms. Such strategies reduce\ngenerality and prune tokens that remain contextually important, limiting their\naccuracy across diverse tasks. To tackle these bottlenecks of existing methods\nfor long-context modeling, we introduce Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention\n(DHSA), a data-driven framework that dynamically predicts attention sparsity\nonline without retraining. Our proposed DHSA adaptively segments sequences into\nvariable-length chunks, then computes chunk representations by aggregating the\ntoken embeddings within each chunk. To avoid the bias introduced by varying\nchunk lengths, we apply length-normalized aggregation that scales the averaged\nembeddings by the square root of the chunk size. Finally, DHSA upsamples the\nchunk-level similarity scores to token level similarities to calculate\nimportance scores that determine which token-level interactions should be\npreserved. Our experiments on Gemma2 with Needle-in-a-Haystack Test and\nLongBench show that DHSA matches dense attention in accuracy, while reducing\nprefill latency by 20-60% and peak memory usage by 35%. Compared to other\nrepresentative baselines such as block sparse attention, DHSA achieves\nconsistently higher accuracy (6-18% relative gains) with comparable or lower\ncost, offering an efficient and adaptable solution for long-context on-device\nLLMs."}

The internal visual\nrepresentations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual\nunderstanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without\ncompromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach\nintegrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive\nreasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the\ngeneration of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process\nand can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this,\nwe introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively\nproduces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these\ninto human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset\nMazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad\ndelivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone.\nIt further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and\nQwen2.5-VL.

It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object\nrepresentations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in\nmemory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While\nprior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)\nexplicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability\nnaturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they\ncould: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for\ndownstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic\nnature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two\npatches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode\nIsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,\nwhich reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability\nemerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker\nin ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial\narchitectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining\nobjectives.
