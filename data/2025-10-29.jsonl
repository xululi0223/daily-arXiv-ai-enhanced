While research has\nfocused on the development of complex memory systems, it remains unclear which\ntypes of memory are most effective for long-context conversational tasks. We\npresent a systematic evaluation of memory-augmented methods using LoCoMo, a\nbenchmark of synthetic long-context dialogues annotated for question-answering\ntasks that require diverse reasoning strategies. We analyse full-context\nprompting, semantic memory through retrieval-augmented generation and agentic\nmemory, episodic memory through in-context learning, and procedural memory\nthrough prompt optimization. Our findings show that memory-augmented approaches\nreduce token usage by over 90% while maintaining competitive accuracy. Memory\narchitecture complexity should scale with model capability, with small\nfoundation models benefitting most from RAG, and strong instruction-tuned\nreasoning model gaining from episodic learning through reflections and more\ncomplex agentic semantic memory. In particular, episodic memory can help LLMs\nrecognise the limits of their own knowledge."}

Here we propose a tool (CoMPSeT) that\nprovides clearer insights over different features in existing MPST. We select a\nrepresentative set of MPST examples and provide mechanisms to combine different\nfeatures and to animate and compare the semantics of concrete examples. CoMPSeT\nis open-source, compiled into JavaScript, and can be directly executed from any\nbrowser, becoming useful both for researchers who want to better understand the\nlandscape of MPST and for teachers who want to explain global choreographies."}

Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves\nremarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to\ndownstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix.

However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained\nrepresentations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability\nsimultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation\ninterpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable\nsemantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,\nonly the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas\nthe uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we\npropose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the\ninformation loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies\nthe representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation\ninterpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that\nthe interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,\nrepresentations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable\nsemantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further\nsupports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the\nclassifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with\ninterpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for\nthe representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with\nless accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and\ncorresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements\nin interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models.

However,\nwhen a word appears in a text, this ambiguity is generally much reduced.\nDisambiguating POS involves using context to reduce the number of POS\nassociated with words, and is one of the main challenges of lexical tagging.\nThe problem of labeling words by POS frequently arises in natural language\nprocessing, for example for spelling correction, grammar or style checking,\nexpression recognition, text-to-speech conversion, text corpus analysis, etc.\nLexical tagging systems are thus useful as an initial component of many natural\nlanguage processing systems. A number of recent lexical tagging systems produce\nmultiple solutions when the text is lexically ambiguous or the uniquely correct\nsolution cannot be found. These contributions aim to guarantee a zero silence\nrate: the correct tag(s) for a word must never be discarded. This objective is\nunrealistic for systems that tag each word uniquely. This article concerns a\nlexical disambiguation method adapted to the objective of a zero silence rate\nand implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system (1993).

We show that to verify a local disambiguation\ngrammar in this framework, it is not sufficient to consider the transducer\npaths separately: one needs to verify their interactions. Similarly, if a\ncombination of multiple transducers is used, the result cannot be predicted by\nconsidering them in isolation. Furthermore, when examining the initial labeling\nof a text as produced by INTEX, ideas for disambiguation rules come\nspontaneously, but grammatical intuitions may turn out to be inaccurate, often\ndue to an unforeseen construction or ambiguity. If a zero silence rate is\ntargeted, local grammars must be carefully tested. This is where a detailed\nspecification of what a grammar will do once applied to texts would be\nnecessary."}

Finally, DHSA upsamples the\nchunk-level similarity scores to token level similarities to calculate\nimportance scores that determine which token-level interactions should be\npreserved. Our experiments on Gemma2 with Needle-in-a-Haystack Test and\nLongBench show that DHSA matches dense attention in accuracy, while reducing\nprefill latency by 20-60% and peak memory usage by 35%. Compared to other\nrepresentative baselines such as block sparse attention, DHSA achieves\nconsistently higher accuracy (6-18% relative gains) with comparable or lower\ncost, offering an efficient and adaptable solution for long-context on-device\nLLMs."}

Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking\nto develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework\nthat equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual\nrepresentations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual\nunderstanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without\ncompromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach\nintegrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive\nreasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the\ngeneration of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process\nand can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this,\nwe introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively\nproduces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these\ninto human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset\nMazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad\ndelivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone.\nIt further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and\nQwen2.5-VL.

To address this gap, we introduce\nInteractComp, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can\nrecognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search.\nFollowing the principle of easy to verify, interact to disambiguate, we\nconstruct 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains through a\ntarget-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only\nthrough interaction. Evaluation of 17 models reveals striking failure: the best\nmodel achieves only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context,\nexposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced\ninteraction produces dramatic gains, demonstrating latent capability current\nstrategies fail to engage. Longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities\nstagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold,\nrevealing a critical blind spot. This stagnation, coupled with the immediate\nfeedback inherent to search tasks, makes InteractComp a valuable resource for\nboth evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents.

To explore these limitations in VideoLMs, we introduce\nMUStReason, a diagnostic benchmark enriched with annotations of\nmodality-specific relevant cues and underlying reasoning steps to identify\nsarcastic intent. In addition to benchmarking sarcasm classification\nperformance in VideoLMs, using MUStReason we quantitatively and qualitatively\nevaluate the generated reasoning by disentangling the problem into perception\nand reasoning, we propose PragCoT, a framework that steers VideoLMs to focus on\nimplied intentions over literal meaning, a property core to detecting sarcasm."}

Aggregation of\nthese local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global\nmodel optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for\nmost clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge\nby exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on\ntheir own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples,\nwhich is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component\nof robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and\nevaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated\nLearning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their\ngeneralization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a\nsingle communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the\nconsidered metrics.
