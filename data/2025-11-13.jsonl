The adoption of edge artificial intelligence, embedding AI directly into edge devices, is rapidly growing. Despite the implementation of guardrails and safety mechanisms, security vulnerabilities and challenges have become increasingly prevalent in this domain, posing a significant barrier to the practical deployment and safety of AI systems. This paper proposes an agentic AI safety architecture that leverages 3D to integrate a dedicated safety layer. It introduces an adaptive AI safety infrastructure capable of dynamically learning and mitigating attacks against the AI system. The system leverages the inherent advantages of co-location with the edge computing hardware to continuously monitor, detect and proactively mitigate threats to the AI system. The integration of local processing and learning capabilities enhances resilience against emerging network-based attacks while simultaneously improving system reliability, modularity, and performance, all with minimal cost and 3D integration overhead."}

In this work we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first implementation of selective code offloading to FPGAs via the OpenMP target directive within MLIR. Our approach combines the MLIR OpenMP dialect with a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) dialect to provide a portable compilation flow targeting FPGAs. Unlike prior OpenMP FPGA efforts that rely on custom compilers, by contrast we integrate with MLIR and so support any MLIR-compatible front end, demonstrated here with Flang. Building upon a range of existing MLIR building blocks significantly reduces the effort required and demonstrates the composability benefits of the MLIR ecosystem.

DC flexibility (a.k.a. load adaptation) is a key to reducing DC carbon emissions by improving grid renewable absorption.\n  DC flexibility can be created, without disturbing datacenter capacity by decoupling a datacenter's power capacity and grid load with a collection of energy resources. Because decoupling can be costly, we study how to best distribute and manage decoupling to maximize benefits for all. Key considerations include site variation and datacenter-grid cooperation.\n  We first define and compute the power and energy needs of datacenter load decoupling, and then we evaluate designed distribution and management approaches. Evaluation shows that optimized distribution can deliver >98% of the potential grid carbon reduction with 70% of the total decoupling need. For management, DC-grid cooperation (2-way sharing and control vs. 1-way info sharing) enables 1.4x grid carbon reduction. Finally, we show that decoupling may be economically viable, as on average datacenters can get power cost and carbon emissions benefits greater than their local costs of decoupling. However, skew across sites suggests grid intervention may be required."}

Four major cloud providers by market share AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) are compared across Intel, AMD, and ARM general purpose instance types under both on-demand and one-year discounted pricing. AWS consistently delivers the shortest runtime in all three instance types, yet charges a premium, especially for on-demand usage. OCI emerges as the most economical option across all CPU families, although it generally runs workloads more slowly than AWS. Azure often exhibits mid-range performance and cost, while GCP presents a mixed profile: it sees a notable boost when moving from Intel to AMD. On the other hand, its ARM instance is more than twice as slow as its own AMD offering and remains significantly more expensive. AWS's internal comparisons reveal that its ARM instance can outperform its Intel and AMD siblings by up to 49 percent in runtime. These findings highlight how instance choices and provider selection can yield substantial variations in both runtime and price, indicating that workload priorities, whether raw speed or cost minimization, should guide decisions on instance types."}

As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning.

Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation."}

In this paper, based on our experiences building the Advanced Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (APPFL) framework, we present our vision for an enterprise-grade, privacy-preserving FL framework designed to scale seamlessly across computing environments. We identify several key capabilities that such a framework must provide: (1) Scalable local simulation and prototyping to accelerate experimentation and algorithm design; (2) seamless transition from simulation to deployment; (3) distributed deployment across diverse, real-world infrastructures, from personal devices to cloud clusters and HPC systems; (4) multi-level abstractions that balance ease of use and research flexibility; and (5) comprehensive privacy and security through techniques such as differential privacy, secure aggregation, robust authentication, and confidential computing. We further discuss architectural designs to realize these goals.

This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment.

These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation."}

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fréchet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

This introduces unnecessary delays on the critical path of the application, limiting throughput. In this paper, we re-think synchronization for tasks that are scheduled entirely in the userspace (e.g., coroutines, fibers, etc.). We develop Combine-and-Exchange Scheduling (CES), a novel scheduling approach that ensures contended critical sections stay on the same thread of execution while parallelizable work is evenly spread across the remaining threads.

However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling."}

We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

Lock-free concurrent queue with coordination-free memory reclamation", "summary": "The queue is conceptually one of the simplest data structures-a basic FIFO container. However, ensuring correctness in the presence of concurrency makes existing lock-free implementations significantly more complex than their original form. Coordination mechanisms introduced to prevent hazards such as ABA, use-after-free, and unsafe reclamation often dominate the design, overshadowing the queue itself. Many schemes compromise strict FIFO ordering, unbounded capacity, or lock-free progress to mask coordination overheads. Yet the true source of complexity lies in the pursuit of infinite protection against reclamation hazards--theoretically sound but impractical and costly. This pursuit not only drives unnecessary complexity but also creates a protection paradox where excessive protection reduces system resilience rather than improving it. While such costs may be tolerable in conventional workloads, the AI era has shifted the paradigm: training and inference pipelines involve hundreds to thousands of concurrent threads per node, and at this scale, protection and coordination overheads dominate, often far heavier than the basic queue operations themselves.\n  This paper introduces Cyclic Memory Protection (CMP), a coordination-free queue that preserves strict FIFO semantics, unbounded capacity, and lock-free progress while restoring simplicity. CMP reclaims the strict FIFO that other approaches sacrificed through bounded protection windows that provide practical reclamation guarantees. We prove strict FIFO and safety via linearizability and bounded reclamation analysis, and show experimentally that CMP outperforms state-of-the-art lock-free queues by up to 1.72-4x under high contention while maintaining scalability to hundreds of threads. Our work demonstrates that highly concurrent queues can return to their fundamental simplicity without weakening queue semantics."}

We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub."}

However, programming these architectures remains challenging due to the need for explicit orchestration of data movement through reconfigurable networks-on-chip and asynchronous computation triggered by data arrival. Existing FPGA and CGRA programming models emphasize loop scheduling but overlook the unique capabilities of spatial dataflow architectures, particularly efficient dataflow over regular grids and intricate routing management.\n  We present SPADA, a programming language that provides precise control over data placement, dataflow patterns, and asynchronous operations while abstracting architecture-specific low-level details. We introduce a rigorous dataflow semantics framework for SPADA that defines routing correctness, data races, and deadlocks. Additionally, we design and implement a compiler targeting Cerebras CSL with multi-level lowering.\n  SPADA serves as both a high-level programming interface and an intermediate representation for domain-specific languages (DSLs), which we demonstrate with the GT4Py stencil DSL. SPADA enables developers to express complex parallel patterns -- including pipelined reductions and multi-dimensional stencils -- in 6--8x less code than CSL with near-ideal weak scaling across three orders of magnitude. By unifying programming for spatial dataflow architectures under a single model, SPADA advances both the theoretical foundations and practical usability of these emerging high-performance computing platforms."}

In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \\texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \\texttt{GPT} and \\texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \\texttt{Gemini} and \\texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience.

However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment."}

However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology."}

RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations.

Focusing on the news domain where knowledge updates daily, OKBench is an agentic framework that automates the sourcing, creation, validation, and distribution of benchmarks. Our approach democratizes benchmark creation and facilitates thorough evaluation of retrieval-augmented methods by reducing overlap with pretraining data. We evaluate our framework on a wide range open-source and proprietary LLMs of various sizes and configurations, both with and without retrieval over freshly generated knowledge.

While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding."}

This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment.

Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years."}

Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.\n  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization."}

A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement.

In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases."}

In this paper, we introduce PoseKAN, an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), framework that extends KANs to graph-based learning for 2D-to-3D pose lifting from a single image. Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations. Our model employs multi-hop feature aggregation, ensuring the body joints can leverage information from both local and distant neighbors, leading to improved spatial awareness. It also incorporates residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and a global response normalization for improved feature selectivity and contrast. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model against state-of-the-art methods."}

However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later."}

Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features. In this work, we introduce SIFT-Graph, a multimodal defense framework that enhances the robustness of traditional vision models by aggregating structurally meaningful features extracted from raw images using both handcrafted and learned modalities. Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model. Preliminary results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the visual model robustness against gradient-based white box adversarial attacks, while incurring only a marginal drop in clean accuracy."}

In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs."}

However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations."}

Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD."}

This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity.

Extant contrastive learning networks, whose two encoders often implicitly interact with each other by parameter sharing or momentum updating, may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of the positive pairs to extract clustering features from input data. To explicitly fuse the learned features of positive pairs, we design a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) based on the excellent feature learning ability of Vision Transformers (ViT). Firstly, two preprocessed augmentions as positive pairs are separately fed into two shared-weight ViTs, then their output features are fused to input into a larger ViT. Secondly, the learned features are split into a pair of new augmented positive samples and passed to the next FAVBs, enabling multiple fusion and augmention through MFAVBs operations. Finally, the learned features are projected into both instance-level and clustering-level spaces to calculate the cross-entropy loss, followed by parameter updates by backpropagation to finalize the training process. To further enhance ability of the model to distinguish between similar images, our input data for the network we propose is preprocessed augmentions with features extracted from the CLIP pretrained model.

We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content.

Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second."}

Previous unsupervised methods attempt to achieve style transfer across multi-temporal remote sensing images through reconstruction by a generator network, and then capture the unreconstructable areas as the changed regions. However, it often leads to poor performance due to generator overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) to address this challenge.

In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation."}

Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue."}

A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space."}

However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development."}

Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM).

While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a \"lossy compressor\", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch\", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability.

However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively. This work is the first attempt to explore the power of ensemble non-attention in boosting cross-architecture transferability, providing new insights into launching ensemble attacks."}

We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference."}

While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents."}

Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality.

To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding.

Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection."}

However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs."}

While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to \"identity mapping\", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid \"identity mapping\" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening."}

However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\\%).

Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches."}

A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks."}

Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival).

Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages."}

To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models."}

PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality).

This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account."}

Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process.

We propose Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation (UL-TTA), a fully training-free and backprop-free framework that freezes the backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters: class prototypes, class priors, and temperature. UL-TTA performs an online EM-style procedure with (i) selective sample filtering to use only confident predictions, (ii) closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes and priors anchored by text and Dirichlet priors, (iii) decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and (iv) lightweight guards (norm clipping, prior KL constraints, smoothed temperature) to prevent drift in long streams. Across large-scale cross-domain and OOD benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet, Terra Incognita, ImageNet-R/A/V2/Sketch; ~726K test samples) and strong TTA baselines including Tent, T3A, CoTTA, SAR, Tip-Adapter, and FreeTTA, UL-TTA consistently improves top-1 accuracy (e.g., +4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP on average) while reducing ECE by 20-30%, with less than 8% latency overhead.

Moreover, the increasing scale and scope of current benchmarks with transient metrics, as well as the heavily human-dependent curation procedure, pose significant challenges for timely maintenance and adaptation to gauge the advancing capabilities of large models.

However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:\n  \\textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs."}

Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation.

To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones.

It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction."}

We prove that, under mild conditions, the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics of input features with respect to class labels. Motivated by this finding, we propose an encoding-decoding perspective : forward propagation encodes inputs into class space, while VJP in backpropagation decodes this encoding back to feature space. Therefore, we propose Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle information flow. By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, alongside consistent classification accuracy gains."}

To help making texts more readable and make information more accessible to everyone, a line of researched aims at making texts accessible for their target audience: automatic text simplification (ATS). Lately, there have been studies on the correlations between automatic evaluation metrics in ATS and human judgment. However, the correlations between those two aspects and commonly available readability measures (such as readability formulas or linguistic features) have not been the focus of as much attention. In this work, we investigate the place of readability measures in ATS by complementing the existing studies on evaluation metrics and human judgment, on English. We first discuss the relationship between ATS and research in readability, then we report a study on correlations between readability measures and human judgment, and between readability measures and ATS evaluation metrics. We identify that in general, readability measures do not correlate well with automatic metrics and human judgment. We argue that as the three different angles from which simplification can be assessed tend to exhibit rather low correlations with one another, there is a need for a clear definition of the construct in ATS."}

Although this ownership structure grants decision-making autonomy, it places a burden of responsibility on cooperative's board members. Most board members lack the resources or expertise to manage properties and their energy consumption. This ignorance presents a unique challenge, especially given the EU directives that prohibit buildings rated as energy classes F and G by 2033. Conversational agents (CAs) enable human-like interactions with computer systems, facilitating human-computer interaction across various domains. In our case, CAs can be implemented to support cooperative members in making informed energy retrofitting and usage decisions. This paper introduces a Conversational agent system, called SPARA, designed to advise cooperatives on energy efficiency. SPARA functions as an energy efficiency advisor by leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with a Language Model(LM). The LM generates targeted recommendations based on a knowledge base composed of email communications between professional energy advisors and cooperatives' representatives in Stockholm. The preliminary results indicate that SPARA can provide energy efficiency advice with precision 80\\%, comparable to that of municipal energy efficiency (EE) experts. A pilot implementation is currently underway, where municipal EE experts are evaluating SPARA performance based on questions posed to EE experts by BRF members. Our findings suggest that LMs can significantly improve outreach by supporting stakeholders in their energy transition. For future work, more research is needed to evaluate this technology, particularly limitations to the stability and trustworthiness of its energy efficiency advice."}

In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions."}

CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps.

We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes.

When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation."}

In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines."}

For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set.

Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection."}

Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions.

However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene."}

Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation."}

Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search."}

Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods."}

The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies."}

Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps.

To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51."}

While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting."}

However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations."}

Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method."}

More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification.

We evaluate Routesplain on 16 state-of-the-art LLMs across eight software-related tasks; Routesplain outperforms individual models both in terms of accuracy and cost, and equals or surpasses all black-box baselines, with concept-level intervention highlighting avenues for further router improvements."}

This approach converts topological features into powerful feature vectors through Betti functions. By integrating these feature vectors with a simple machine learning model like XGBoost, we achieve a computationally efficient machine learning model. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in both binary and three-class classification tasks for ADNI 3D MRI disease diagnosis. Using 10-fold cross-validation, our model achieved an average accuracy of 97.43 percent and sensitivity of 99.09 percent for binary classification. For three-class classification, it achieved an average accuracy of 95.47 percent and sensitivity of 94.98 percent. Unlike many deep learning models, our approach does not require data augmentation or extensive preprocessing, making it particularly suitable for smaller datasets. Topological features differ significantly from those commonly extracted using convolutional filters and other deep learning machinery. Because it provides an entirely different type of information from machine learning models, it has the potential to combine topological features with other models later on."}

In response, this work proposes an efficient ROI-based deep image compression model with implicit bit allocation. To better utilize ROI masks for implicit bit allocation, this paper proposes a novel Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement (MGFE) module, comprising a Region-Adaptive Attention (RAA) block and a Frequency-Spatial Collaborative Attention (FSCA) block.

In this paper, we propose Semantic Cognition Over Potential-based Exploration (SCOPE), a zero-shot framework that explicitly leverages frontier information to drive potential-based exploration, enabling more informed and goal-relevant decisions.

To address these gaps, we introduce MicroEvoEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for image-based microstructure evolution prediction. We evaluate 14 models, encompassing both domain-specific and general-purpose architectures, across four representative MicroEvo tasks with datasets specifically structured for both short- and long-term assessment. Our multi-faceted evaluation framework goes beyond numerical accuracy and computational cost, incorporating a curated set of structure-preserving metrics to assess physical fidelity. Our extensive evaluations yield several key insights. Notably, we find that modern architectures (e.g., VMamba), not only achieve superior long-term stability and physical fidelity but also operate with an order-of-magnitude greater computational efficiency.

To address these ambiguities, we introduce the Plug-and-Play Clarifier, a zero-shot and modular framework that decomposes the problem into discrete, solvable sub-tasks. Specifically, our framework consists of three synergistic modules: (1) a text clarifier that uses dialogue-driven reasoning to interactively disambiguate linguistic intent, (2) a vision clarifier that delivers real-time guidance feedback, instructing users to adjust their positioning for improved capture quality, and (3) a cross-modal clarifier with grounding mechanism that robustly interprets 3D pointing gestures and identifies the specific objects users are pointing to. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework improves the intent clarification performance of small language models (4--8B) by approximately 30%, making them competitive with significantly larger counterparts. We also observe consistent gains when applying our framework to these larger models. Furthermore, our vision clarifier increases corrective guidance accuracy by over 20%, and our cross-modal clarifier improves semantic answer accuracy for referential grounding by 5%. Overall, our method provides a plug-and-play framework that effectively resolves multimodal ambiguity and significantly enhances user experience in egocentric interaction."}

Unlike traditional spatio-temporal data analysis tasks, the dependence on both spatio-temporal and visual-textual data introduces distinct challenges to TSU task. However, recent research often treats TSU as a common image understanding task, ignoring the spatio-temporal information and overlooking the interrelations between different aspects of the traffic scene. To address these issues, we propose a novel SpatioTemporal Enhanced Model based on CILP (ST-CLIP) for TSU. Our model uses the classic vision-language model, CLIP, as the backbone, and designs a Spatio-temporal Context Aware Multiaspect Prompt (SCAMP) learning method to incorporate spatiotemporal information into TSU. The prompt learning method consists of two components: A dynamic spatio-temporal context representation module that extracts representation vectors of spatio-temporal data for each traffic scene image, and a bi-level ST-aware multi-aspect prompt learning module that integrates the ST-context representation vectors into word embeddings of prompts for the CLIP model. The second module also extracts low-level visual features and image-wise high-level semantic features to exploit interactive relations among different aspects of traffic scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate spatio-temporal information into visionlanguage models to facilitate TSU task.

Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details.

Image-to-image translation can map ULF images to a high-field appearance, yet efficacy is limited by scarce paired training data. Working within the ULF-EnC challenge constraints (50 paired 3D volumes; no external data), we study how task-adapted data augmentations impact a standard deep model for ULF image enhancement. We show that strong, diverse augmentations, including auxiliary tasks on high-field data, substantially improve fidelity. Our submission ranked third by brain-masked SSIM on the public validation leaderboard and fourth by the official score on the final test leaderboard.

In contrast, abundant human motion data is readily available from motion capture, videos, and virtual reality, which could help address the data scarcity problem. However, due to the embodiment gap and missing dynamic information like force and torque, these demonstrations cannot be directly executed on robots. To bridge this gap, we propose Scalable Physics-Informed DExterous Retargeting (SPIDER), a physics-based retargeting framework to transform and augment kinematic-only human demonstrations to dynamically feasible robot trajectories at scale. Our key insight is that human demonstrations should provide global task structure and objective, while large-scale physics-based sampling with curriculum-style virtual contact guidance should refine trajectories to ensure dynamical feasibility and correct contact sequences. SPIDER scales across diverse 9 humanoid/dexterous hand embodiments and 6 datasets, improving success rates by 18% compared to standard sampling, while being 10X faster than reinforcement learning (RL) baselines, and enabling the generation of a 2.4M frames dynamic-feasible robot dataset for policy learning. As a universal physics-based retargeting method, SPIDER can work with diverse quality data and generate diverse and high-quality data to enable efficient policy learning with methods like RL."}

However, these models struggle with long-horizon tasks due to their lack of memory and reliance solely on immediate sensory inputs. To address this limitation, we propose Memory-Augmented Prompting for Vision-Language-Action model (MAP-VLA), a novel framework that empowers pre-trained VLA models with demonstration-derived memory prompts to augment action generation for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. To achieve this, MAP-VLA first constructs a memory library from historical demonstrations, where each memory unit captures information about a specific stage of a task. These memory units are implemented as learnable soft prompts optimized through prompt tuning. Then, during real-time task execution, MAP-VLA retrieves relevant memory through trajectory similarity matching and dynamically integrates it into the VLA model for augmented action generation. Importantly, this prompt tuning and retrieval augmentation approach operates as a plug-and-play module for a frozen VLA model, offering a lightweight and flexible solution to improve task performance. Experimental results show that MAP-VLA delivers up to 7.0% absolute performance gains in the simulation benchmark and 25.0% on real robot evaluations for long-horizon tasks, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods."}

Point-based methods suffer from sparse sampling, leading to the loss of fine-grained semantics. Image-based methods typically feed RGB and depth into 2D backbones pre-trained on 3D auxiliary tasks, but their entangled semantics and geometry are sensitive to inherent depth noise in real-world that disrupts semantic understanding. Moreover, these methods focus on high-level geometry while overlooking low-level spatial cues essential for precise interaction. We propose SpatialActor, a disentangled framework for robust robotic manipulation that explicitly decouples semantics and geometry. The Semantic-guided Geometric Module adaptively fuses two complementary geometry from noisy depth and semantic-guided expert priors. Also, a Spatial Transformer leverages low-level spatial cues for accurate 2D-3D mapping and enables interaction among spatial features. We evaluate SpatialActor on multiple simulation and real-world scenarios across 50+ tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with 87.4% on RLBench and improves by 13.9% to 19.4% under varying noisy conditions, showing strong robustness. Moreover, it significantly enhances few-shot generalization to new tasks and maintains robustness under various spatial perturbations. Project Page: https://shihao1895.github.io/SpatialActor"}

However, while these models can direct a robot toward the general region of an object, they lack the geometric understanding required to precisely control dexterous robotic hands for 3D grasping. To overcome this, our key insight is to leverage simulation with a force-closure grasping generation pipeline that understands local geometries of the hand and object in the scene. Because this pipeline is slow and requires ground-truth observations, the resulting data is distilled into a diffusion model that operates in real-time on camera point clouds. By combining the global semantic understanding of internet-scale models with the geometric precision of a simulation-based locally-aware force-closure, \\our achieves high-performance semantic grasping without any manually collected training data.
