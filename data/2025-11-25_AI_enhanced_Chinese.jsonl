To preserve the convergence and model performance, Pier incorporates two key techniques for the outer optimizer: momentum warmup and momentum decay. Pier employs an efficient and scalable system architecture to enable complex parallelization strategies in LLM pretraining. We examine the model performance and runtime reduction of Pier using the GPT model family (e.g., small, medium, XL, and 7B) and the OpenWebText dataset with a suite of thirteen downstream tasks. With data parallel strategy, Pier speeds up GPT-2 XL training by up to 2.7x-3.7x on 256 NVIDIA A100 GPUs and 1.2x-1.9x on 64 GH200 Superchips, respectively, without degradation of validation loss or downstream task performance.

Situations such as job start-ups, checkpoint storms, or heavily skewed namespace access can trigger thousands of concurrent metadata requests against a small subset of servers. The result is long queues, inflated tail latencies, and reduced system throughput. Prior efforts including static namespace partitioning, backend-specific extensions, and kernel-level modifications address parts of the problem, but they often prove too rigid, intrusive to deploy, or unstable under shifting workloads. We present MIDAS, an adaptive middleware layer that operates transparently between clients and metadata servers, requiring no changes to kernels or storage backends. The design brings together three mechanisms: (i) a namespace-aware load balancer that enhances consistent hashing with power-of-d sampling informed by live telemetry, (ii) a cooperative caching layer that preserves backend semantics through leases, invalidations, or adaptive timeouts, and (iii) a self-stabilizing control loop that dynamically adjusts routing aggressiveness and cache lifetimes while avoiding oscillations under bursty workloads. Analysis of the model and controlled experiments show that MIDAS reduces average queue lengths by roughly 23% and mitigates worst-case hotspots by up to 80% when compared to round-robin scheduling. These findings highlight that a stability-aware, middleware-based strategy can provide backend-agnostic improvements to metadata management, enabling better scalability in bursty scenarios, more predictable tail latencies, and stronger overall system performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "MIDAS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u547d\u540d\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u7f13\u5b58\u5c42\u548c\u81ea\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\u5faa\u73af\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5143\u6570\u636e\u70ed\u70b9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u961f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u70ed\u70b9\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5143\u6570\u636e\u70ed\u70b9\u662f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u4e91\u5b58\u50a8\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55I/O\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u961f\u5217\u3001\u5c3e\u90e8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u52a0\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u964d\u4f4e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8fc7\u4e8e\u50f5\u5316\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u5f3a\u6216\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "MIDAS\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u547d\u540d\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u5668\uff08\u589e\u5f3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u54c8\u5e0c\uff09\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u7f13\u5b58\u5c42\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u79df\u7ea6\u3001\u5931\u6548\u6216\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d85\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u540e\u7aef\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\u3001\u81ea\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\u5faa\u73af\uff08\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8def\u7531\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u548c\u7f13\u5b58\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u8f6e\u8be2\u8c03\u5ea6\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cMIDAS\u5e73\u5747\u961f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea623%\uff0c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u70ed\u70b9\u7f13\u89e3\u8fbe80%\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7a81\u53d1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u5c3e\u90e8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u540e\u7aef\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728\u7a81\u53d1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This work contributes to the modeling and evaluation of such environments by extending the CloudSim Plus simulation framework to support realistic spot instance lifecycle management, including interruption, termination, hibernation, and reallocation. The enhanced simulator is validated using synthetic scenarios and large-scale simulations based on the Google Cluster Trace dataset. Building on this foundation, the HLEM-VMP allocation algorithm, originally proposed in earlier research, was adapted to operate under dynamic spot market conditions. Its performance was evaluated against baseline allocation strategies to assess its efficiency and resilience in volatile workload environments.

However, deploying these models for EHR question answering (QA) systems in safety-critical clinical environments remains challenging: incorrect SQL queries-whether caused by model errors or problematic user inputs-can undermine clinical decision-making and jeopardize patient care. While prior work has mainly focused on improving SQL generation accuracy or filtering questions before execution, there is a lack of a unified benchmark for evaluating independent post-hoc verification mechanisms (i.e., a component that inspects and validates the generated SQL before execution), which is crucial for safe deployment. To fill this gap, we introduce SCARE, a benchmark for evaluating methods that function as a post-hoc safety layer in EHR QA systems. SCARE evaluates the joint task of (1) classifying question answerability (i.e., determining whether a question is answerable, ambiguous, or unanswerable) and (2) verifying or correcting candidate SQL queries. The benchmark comprises 4,200 triples of questions, candidate SQL queries, and expected model outputs, grounded in the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU databases. It covers a diverse set of questions and corresponding candidate SQL queries generated by seven different text-to-SQL models, ensuring a realistic and challenging evaluation. Using SCARE, we benchmark a range of approaches-from two-stage methods to agentic frameworks.

The Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) to the ARM AArch64 Instruction Set Architecture is a valuable tool to address memory-safety escapes; when used in synchronous tag-checking mode, MTE provides deterministic detection and prevention of sequential buffer overflow attacks, and probabilistic detection and prevention of exploits resulting from temporal use-after-free pointer programming bugs. The AmpereOne processor, launched in 2024, is the first datacenter processor to support MTE. Its optimized MTE implementation uniquely incurs no memory capacity overhead for tag storage and provides synchronous tag-checking with single-digit performance impact across a broad range of datacenter class workloads. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the complete hardware-software stack, identifying application memory management as the primary remaining source of overhead and highlighting clear opportunities for software optimization.

Authors' version posted for personal use and not for redistribution", "summary": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in disaster response require complex, queryable intelligence that on-board CNNs cannot provide. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer this semantic reasoning, their high resource demands make on-device deployment infeasible, and naive cloud offloading fails under the low-bandwidth networks common in disaster zones. We present AVERY, a framework that enables VLM deployment through adaptive split computing. We advance the split computing paradigm beyond traditional depth-wise partitioning by introducing a functional, cognitive-inspired dual-stream split that separates the VLM into a high-frequency, low-resolution \"context stream\" for real-time awareness and a low-frequency, high-fidelity \"insight stream\" for deep analysis. A lightweight, self-aware on-board controller manages this architecture, monitoring network conditions and operator intent to dynamically select from pre-trained compression models, navigating the fundamental accuracy-throughput trade-off. Evaluated using the VLM LISA-7B across an edge-cloud scenario under fluctuating network conditions, AVERY consistently outperforms static configurations, achieving 11.2% higher accuracy than raw image compression and 93.98% lower energy consumption compared to full-edge execution, thereby enhancing mission efficiency and enabling real-time, queryable intelligence on resource-constrained platforms in dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "AVERY\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5272\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u53cc\u6d41\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6d41\u548c\u6d1e\u5bdf\u6d41\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u707e\u96be\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u4f4e\u5e26\u5bbd\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u67e5\u8be2\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u707e\u96be\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u53ef\u67e5\u8be2\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u8fc7\u9ad8\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e91\u7aef\u5378\u8f7d\u5728\u4f4e\u5e26\u5bbd\u707e\u96be\u533a\u57df\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u53cc\u6d41\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9ad8\u9891\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6d41\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4f4e\u9891\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\u6d41\u7528\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u3002\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u611f\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6839\u636e\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u610f\u56fe\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528LISA-7B VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cAVERY\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad811.2%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5168\u8fb9\u7f18\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e93.98%\u3002", "conclusion": "AVERY\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5e73\u53f0\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u67e5\u8be2\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Recent advances in KV Cache reuse have shown potential to mitigate these costs, but still suffer from notable performance degradation. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth investigation of recomputation-based reuse methods and observe that the recomputed tokens often fail to align with the context segments most relevant to the question.

Therefore, we propose the $\\textbf{A}$ttention-$\\textbf{A}$ware $\\textbf{A}$ccurate KV Cache Fusion algorithm ($A^3$), which precomputes and selectively fuses the KV Cache of text chunks based on their relevance to the question, achieving accurate integration with minimal computational overhead.

In this work, we propose a Multimodal Autoencoder (MMAE) that learns unified representations across text, audio, and visual data, enabling end-to-end automation of metadata extraction and semantic clustering. The model is trained on the recently introduced LUMA dataset, a fully aligned benchmark of multimodal triplets representative of real-world media content. By minimizing joint reconstruction losses across modalities, the MMAE discovers modality-invariant semantic structures without relying on large paired or contrastive datasets. We demonstrate significant improvements in clustering and alignment metrics (Silhouette, ARI, NMI) compared to linear baselines, indicating that reconstruction-based multimodal embeddings can serve as a foundation for scalable metadata generation and cross-modal retrieval in broadcast archives.

However, existing studies focus primarily on its algorithmic advantages such as accuracy and compression ratio-while overlooking the hardware deployment efficiency. Such hardware-unaware designs often obscure the potential latency and energy benefits of tensorized models. Although several works attempt to reduce computational cost by optimizing the contraction sequence based on the number of multiply-accumulate operations, they typically neglect the underlying hardware characteristics, resulting in suboptimal real-world performance. We observe that the contraction path, hardware architecture, and dataflow mapping are tightly coupled and must be optimized jointly within a unified design space to maximize deployment efficiency on real devices. To this end, we propose a co-exploration framework that unifies these dimensions within a unified design space for efficient training and inference of tensorized neural networks on edge platforms. The framework formulates a latency oriented search objective and solves it via a global latency-driven exploration across the unified design space to achieve end-to-end model efficiency.

Hence, the name comes \\emph{monotone decontamination}. This problem has been relatively explored in static graphs, but nothing is known yet in dynamic graphs. We, in this paper, study the \\emph{monotone decontamination} problem in arbitrary dynamic graphs. We designed two models of dynamicity, based on the time within which a disappeared edge must reappear. In each of these two models, we proposed lower bounds as well as upper bounds on the number of agents, required to fully decontaminate the underlying dynamic graph, monotonically. Our results also highlight the difficulties faced due to the sudden disappearance or reappearance of edges. Our aim in this paper has been to primarily optimize the number of agents required to solve monotone decontamination in these dynamic networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u53bb\u6c61\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f51\u7edc\u53bb\u6c61\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u610f\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u53bb\u6c61\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6240\u9700\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u6d88\u5931\u540e\u91cd\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u548c\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5355\u8c03\u53bb\u6c61\u6240\u9700\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fb9\u7a81\u7136\u6d88\u5931\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u53bb\u6c61\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u6240\u9700\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

However, evaluating this capability remains a significant challenge. Current methods either rely on subjective and costly human evaluation or on automated LLM-as-a-judge systems, which suffer from inherent biases and unreliability. Existing programmatic benchmarks, while objective, often lack the expressiveness to test intricate, compositional constraints at a granular level. To address these limitations, we introduce LexInstructEval, a new benchmark and evaluation framework for fine-grained lexical instruction following. Our framework is built upon a formal, rule-based grammar that deconstructs complex instructions into a canonical <Procedure, Relation, Value> triplet. This grammar enables the systematic generation of a diverse dataset through a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop pipeline and facilitates objective verification via a transparent, programmatic engine.

These properties are a natural fit for SQL database workloads dominated by predicate evaluation and scans, which demand low energy and low latency over large fact tables. Notably, HDC's noise-tolerance maps well onto emerging ferroelectric NAND (FeNAND) memories, which provide ultra-high density and in-storage compute capability but suffer from elevated raw bit-error rates. In this work, we propose HDDB, a hardware-software co-design that combines HDC with FeNAND multi-level cells (MLC) to perform in-storage SQL predicate evaluation and analytics with massive parallelism and minimal data movement. Particularly, we introduce novel HDC encoding techniques for standard SQL data tables and formulate predicate-based filtering and aggregation as highly efficient HDC operations that can happen in-storage. By exploiting the intrinsic redundancy of HDC, HDDB maintains correct predicate and decode outcomes under substantial device noise (up to 10% randomly corrupted TLC cells) without explicit error-correction overheads. Experiments on TPC-DS fact tables show that HDDB achieves up to 80.6x lower latency and 12,636x lower energy consumption compared to conventional CPU/GPU SQL database engines, suggesting that HDDB provides a practical substrate for noise-robust, memory-centric database processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "HDDB\u7ed3\u5408\u8d85\u7ef4\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u94c1\u7535NAND\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b58\u50a8\u5185SQL\u8c13\u8bcd\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528HDC\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5bb9\u5fcd\u7279\u6027\u4e0eFeNAND\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\u7684\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfSQL\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5728\u5927\u578b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8868\u4e0a\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHDDB\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408HDC\u4e0eFeNAND MLC\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684HDC\u7f16\u7801\u6280\u672f\u7528\u4e8eSQL\u6570\u636e\u8868\uff0c\u5c06\u8c13\u8bcd\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u805a\u5408\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684HDC\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728TPC-DS\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8868\u4e0a\uff0cHDDB\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfCPU/GPU SQL\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e80.6\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e12,636\u500d\uff0c\u572810%\u968f\u673a\u635f\u574fTLC\u5355\u5143\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HDDB\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Cloud providers meet this demand through GPU-as-a-Service platforms that offer rentable GPU resources for running AI workloads. In this context, the sharing of GPU resources between different tenants is essential to maximize the number of scheduled workloads. Among the various GPU sharing technologies, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) stands out by partitioning GPUs at hardware level into isolated slices with dedicated compute and memory, ensuring strong tenant isolation, preventing resource contention, and enhancing security. Despite these advantages, MIG's fixed partitioning introduces scheduling rigidity, leading to severe GPU fragmentation in multi-tenant environments, where workloads are continuously deployed and terminated. Fragmentation leaves GPUs underutilized, limiting the number of workloads that can be accommodated. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel scheduling framework for MIG-based clouds that maximizes workload acceptance while mitigating fragmentation in an online, workload-agnostic setting. We introduce a fragmentation metric to quantify resource inefficiency and guide allocation decisions. Building on this metric, our greedy scheduling algorithm selects GPUs and MIG slices that minimize fragmentation growth for each incoming workload. We evaluate our approach against multiple baseline strategies under diverse workload distributions. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher workload acceptance rates, leading to an average 10% increase in the number of scheduled workloads in heavy load conditions, while using approximately the same number of GPUs as the benchmark methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eMIG GPU\u4e91\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u788e\u7247\u5316\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad810%\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8c03\u5ea6\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "MIG GPU\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u533a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684GPU\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97GPU\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u5bb9\u7eb3\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u788e\u7247\u5316\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d2a\u5fc3\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8fdb\u5165\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u788e\u7247\u5316\u589e\u957f\u7684GPU\u548cMIG\u5207\u7247\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad810%\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u81f4\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u91cf\u7684GPU\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3MIG GPU\u4e91\u4e2d\u7684\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8c03\u5ea6\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve this task and have shown remarkable performance. Recently, it has been noticed that the accuracy of data extraction by multi-modal LLMs can be affected when in-plane rotations are present in the documents. However, real-world document images are usually not only in-plane rotated but also perspectively distorted. This study investigates the impacts of such perturbations on the data extraction accuracy for the state-of-the-art model, Gemini-1.5-pro. Because perspective distortions have a high degree of freedom, designing experiments in the same manner as single-parametric rotations is difficult. We observed typical distortions of document images and showed that most of them approximately follow an isosceles-trapezoidal transformation, which allows us to evaluate distortions with a small number of parameters. We were able to reduce the number of independent parameters from eight to two, i.e. rotation angle and distortion ratio. Then, specific entities were extracted from synthetically generated sample documents with varying these parameters. As the performance of LLMs, we evaluated not only a character-recognition accuracy but also a structure-recognition accuracy. Whereas the former represents the classical indicators for optical character recognition, the latter is related to the correctness of reading order. In particular, the structure-recognition accuracy was found to be significantly degraded by document distortion. In addition, we found that this accuracy can be improved by a simple rotational correction.

The increasing capability of consumer devices to capture footage in Ultra High-Definition (UHD) at 4K and 8K resolutions necessitates high-performance video transcoders for internet-based delivery. To address this demand, NVIDIA introduced Split-Frame Encoding (SFE), a technique that leverages multiple on-die NVENC chips available in high-end GPUs. SFE splits a single UHD frame for parallel encoding across these physical encoders and subsequently stitches the results, which significantly improves encoding throughput. However, this approach is known to incur an RD performance penalty. The widespread adoption of NVIDIA GPUs in data centers, driven by the rise of Generative AI, means NVENC is poised to play a critical role in transcoding UHD video. To better understand the performance-efficiency tradeoff of SFE, this paper evaluates SFE's impact on RD performance, encoding throughput, power consumption, and end-to-end latency using standardized test sequences. The results show that for real-time applications, SFE nearly doubles encoding throughput with a negligible RD performance penalty, which enables the use of higher-quality presets for 4K and makes real-time 8K encoding feasible, effectively offsetting the minor RD penalty. Moreover, SFE adds no latency at 4K and can reduce it at 8K, positioning it as a key enabler for high-throughput, real-time UHD transcoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "NVIDIA Split-Frame Encoding (SFE) \u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5355\u4e2aUHD\u5e27\u5206\u5272\u5230\u591a\u4e2aNVENC\u82af\u7247\u5e76\u884c\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u7801\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u51e0\u4e4e\u7ffb\u500d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e14RD\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b9e\u65f68K\u7f16\u7801\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6d88\u8d39\u8bbe\u5907\u80fd\u591f\u62cd\u64444K\u548c8K\u8d85\u9ad8\u6e05\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u4f20\u8f93\u3002NVIDIA\u5728\u9ad8\u7aefGPU\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u591a\u4e2aNVENC\u82af\u7247\uff0cSFE\u6280\u672f\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u7801\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SFE\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u5355\u4e2aUHD\u5e27\u5206\u5272\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u7269\u7406NVENC\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5e76\u884c\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u62fc\u63a5\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e8f\u5217\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9RD\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u7f16\u7801\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u529f\u8017\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "SFE\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u51e0\u4e4e\u4f7f\u7f16\u7801\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7ffb\u500d\uff0cRD\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f4K\u7f16\u7801\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u5b9e\u65f68K\u7f16\u7801\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u57284K\u4e0b\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u57288K\u4e0b\u751a\u81f3\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "SFE\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5b9e\u65f6UHD\u8f6c\u7801\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

To meet both privacy and responsiveness demands, user data is embedded as vectors and stored in a vector database for fast similarity search. However, most existing vector databases target server-class environments. When ported directly to smartphones, two gaps emerge: (G1) a mismatch between mobile SoC constraints and vector-database assumptions, including tight bandwidth budgets, limited on-chip memory, and stricter data type and layout constraints; and (G2) a workload mismatch, because on-device usage resembles a continuously learning memory, in which queries must coexist with frequent inserts, deletions, and ongoing index maintenance. To address these challenges, we propose AME, an on-device Agentic Memory Engine co-designed with modern smartphone SoCs. AME introduces two key techniques: (1) a hardware-aware, high-efficiency matrix pipeline that maximizes compute-unit utilization and exploits multi-level on-chip storage to sustain high throughput; and (2) a hardware- and workload-aware scheduling scheme that coordinates querying, insertion, and index rebuilding to minimize latency. We implement AME on Snapdragon 8-series SoCs and evaluate it on HotpotQA. In our experiments, AME improves query throughput by up to 1.4x at matched recall, achieves up to 7x faster index construction, and delivers up to 6x higher insertion throughput under concurrent query workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "AME\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673aSoC\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5185\u5b58\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u7d22\u5f15\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u63d2\u5165\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a(1)\u79fb\u52a8SoC\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u4e0e\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1b(2)\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u9700\u8981\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u3001\u5220\u9664\u548c\u7d22\u5f15\u7ef4\u62a4\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "method": "AME\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a1)\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u77e9\u9635\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5143\u5229\u7528\u7387\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u591a\u7ea7\u7247\u4e0a\u5b58\u50a8\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff1b2)\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u63d2\u5165\u548c\u7d22\u5f15\u91cd\u5efa\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "result": "\u5728Snapdragon 8\u7cfb\u5217SoC\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAME\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53471.4\u500d\uff0c\u7d22\u5f15\u6784\u5efa\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53477\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u5e76\u53d1\u67e5\u8be2\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u63d2\u5165\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53476\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AME\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This trend has driven the integration of dedicated hardware encoders into modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Nowadays, these encoders support advanced codecs like HEVC and AV1 and feature specialized Low-Latency and Ultra Low-Latency tuning, targeting end-to-end latencies of < 2 seconds and < 500 ms, respectively. As the demand for such capabilities grows toward the 6G era, a clear understanding of their performance implications is essential. In this work, we evaluate the low-latency encoding modes on GPUs from NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD from both Rate-Distortion (RD) performance and latency perspectives. The results are then compared against both the normal-latency tuning of hardware encoders and leading software encoders. Results show hardware encoders achieve significantly lower E2E latency than software solutions with slightly better RD performance. While standard Low-Latency tuning yields a poor quality-latency trade-off, the Ultra Low-Latency mode reduces E2E latency to 83 ms (5 frames) without additional RD impact. Furthermore, hardware encoder latency is largely insensitive to quality presets, enabling high-quality, low-latency streams without compromise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30NVIDIA\u3001Intel\u548cAMD GPU\u4e0a\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u786c\u4ef6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u786c\u4ef6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f4e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0cRD\u6027\u80fd\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u77404K UHD\u6210\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf96G\u65f6\u4ee3\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3GPU\u786c\u4ef6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7f16\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u7387\u5931\u771f\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u89d2\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30NVIDIA\u3001Intel\u548cAMD GPU\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8c03\u4f18\u548c\u9886\u5148\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u786c\u4ef6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6bd4\u8f6f\u4ef6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0cRD\u6027\u80fd\u7565\u4f18\uff1b\u8d85\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6a21\u5f0f\u5c06E2E\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u81f383\u6beb\u79d2\uff085\u5e27\uff09\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cdRD\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u786c\u4ef6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5bf9\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u8bbe\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u786c\u4ef6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This work focuses on two fundamental problems: leader election and spanning tree construction. For each problem, we present a constant-size (per edge), local certification scheme, where the conditions available to each node can only refer to the graph induced by its one-hop neighborhood. In particular, we provide certification schemes for leader election in chordal and $K_4$-free dismantlable graphs and for spanning tree construction in dismantlable graphs, assuming a root is given. For chordal graphs, our leader election certification scheme additionally ensures an acyclic orientation, a property that is not generally verifiable using constant-size certificates in arbitrary graphs. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first local certification results tailored to these graph classes, potentially highlighting structural properties useful for verifying additional problems. Finally, we propose an algorithm that automatically transforms any certification scheme into a silent self-stabilizing algorithm (i.e., an algorithm that automatically recovers from faults) by adding only one extra state to the set of states of the certification scheme, assuming a Gouda fair scheduler. This transformation may be of independent interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5f26\u56fe\u548cK4-free\u53ef\u62c6\u89e3\u56fe\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u62c6\u89e3\u56fe\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6811\u6784\u9020\u7684\u5e38\u6570\u5927\u5c0f\u5c40\u90e8\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5c06\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5173\u6ce8\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6811\u6784\u9020\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u56fe\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e38\u6570\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u5f26\u56fe\u548cK4-free\u53ef\u62c6\u89e3\u56fe\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u7684\u5e38\u6570\u5927\u5c0f\u5c40\u90e8\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u62c6\u89e3\u56fe\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6811\u6784\u9020\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c06\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u56fe\u7c7b\u7684\u5e38\u6570\u5927\u5c0f\u5c40\u90e8\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5f26\u56fe\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u65b9\u6848\u8fd8\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u65e0\u73af\u5b9a\u5411\u3002\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u9700\u5728\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u72b6\u6001\u96c6\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u72b6\u6001\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56fe\u7c7b\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u7528\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u3002\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u5230\u81ea\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We introduce a framework to test epistemic stance transfer: targeted deletion of event knowledge, validated with multiple probes, followed by evaluation of whether models still reproduce the community's organic response patterns under ignorance. Using Russian--Ukrainian military discourse and U.S. partisan Twitter data, we find that even after aggressive fact removal, aligned LLMs maintain stable, community-specific behavioral patterns for handling uncertainty.

Nighttime and dimly lit traffic scenes often suffer from poor visibility due to low illumination, noise, motion blur, non-uniform lighting, and glare from vehicle headlights or street lamps, which hinder tasks such as object detection and scene understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a fully unsupervised multi-stage deep learning framework for low-light traffic image enhancement. The model decomposes images into illumination and reflectance components, progressively refined by three specialized modules: (1) Illumination Adaptation, for global and local brightness correction; (2) Reflectance Restoration, for noise suppression and structural detail recovery using spatial-channel attention; and (3) Over-Exposure Compensation, for reconstructing saturated regions and balancing scene luminance. The network is trained using self-supervised reconstruction, reflectance smoothness, perceptual consistency, and domain-aware regularization losses, eliminating the need for paired ground-truth images. Experiments on general and traffic-specific datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, NIQE) and qualitative visual quality.

To unlock this performance potential on mobile GPUs, we design a novel pixel-based rendering pipeline that improves hardware utilization via Gaussian-parallel rendering and preemptive $\u03b1$-checking. Together, these optimizations yield up to 121.7$\\times$ speedup on the bottleneck stages and 14.6$\\times$ end-to-end speedup on off-the-shelf GPUs. To further address new bottlenecks introduced by our rendering pipeline, we propose a pipelined architecture that simplifies the overall design while addressing newly emerged bottlenecks in projection and aggregation.

Thesis (2017). Abstract revised in 2025 to comply with arXiv character limits", "summary": "In complex systems with many compute nodes containing multiple CPUs that are coherent within each node, a key challenge is maintaining efficient and correct coherence between nodes. The Unimem system addresses this by proposing a virtualized global address space that enables such coherence, relying on the I/O Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) in each node. The goal of this thesis is to support this approach by successfully testing and using the IOMMU of a single node. For this purpose, we used ARM's IOMMU, known as the System Memory Management Unit (SMMU), which translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Because Linux documentation for the SMMU is limited and unclear, we implemented custom kernel modules to test and use its functionality.\n  First, we tested the SMMU in the Processing System (PS) of the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC by developing a module that inserted virtual-to-physical address mappings into the SMMU. We then triggered a DMA transfer to a virtual address and observed that the request passed through the SMMU for address translation. We repeated this experiment by initiating DMA transactions from the Programmable Logic (PL) and similarly confirmed that the transactions were translated by the SMMU. Finally, we developed a module that enables transactions from the PL without requiring explicit pre-mapping of virtual and physical address pairs. This was achieved by configuring the SMMU with the page table pointer of a user process, allowing it to translate all relevant virtual addresses dynamically.\n  Overall, we successfully demonstrated the correct operation of the SMMU across all tested scenarios.

A word is defined as a maximal block of non-space symbols. Within this symbol-level framework, which assumes no morphology, syntax, or semantics, we derive several structural results. First, word lengths follow a geometric distribution governed solely by the probability of the space symbol. Second, the expected number of words of a given length, and the expected number of distinct words of that length, admit closed-form expressions based on a coupon-collector argument. This yields a critical word length k* at which word types transition from appearing many times on average to appearing at most once. Third, combining the exponential growth of the number of possible strings of length k with the exponential decay of the probability of each string, we obtain a Zipf-type rank-frequency law p(r) proportional to r^{-alpha}, with an exponent determined explicitly by the alphabet size and the space probability.\n  Our contribution is twofold. Mathematically, we give a unified derivation linking word lengths, vocabulary growth, critical length, and rank-frequency structure in a single explicit model. Conceptually, we argue that this provides a structurally grounded null model for both natural-language word statistics and token statistics in large language models. The results show that Zipf-like patterns can arise purely from combinatorics and segmentation, without optimization principles or linguistic organization, and help clarify which phenomena require deeper explanation beyond random-text structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u62bd\u53d6\u6709\u9650\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u52a0\u7a7a\u683c\u7b26\u53f7\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5728\u4ec5\u5047\u8bbe\u7ec4\u5408\u5b66\u548c\u5206\u5272\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5b57\u957f\u3001\u4e34\u754c\u5b57\u957f\u4ee5\u53caZipf\u578b\u79e9\u9891\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u7edf\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7a7a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eZipf\u7c7b\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u7eaf\u7cb9\u4ece\u7ec4\u5408\u5b66\u548c\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u539f\u5219\u6216\u8bed\u8a00\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u52a0\u7a7a\u683c\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u62bd\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bcd\u4e3a\u6700\u5927\u975e\u7a7a\u683c\u7b26\u53f7\u5757\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u4f18\u60e0\u5238\u6536\u96c6\u8005\u8bba\u8bc1\u63a8\u5bfc\u7ed3\u6784\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5b57\u957f\u670d\u4ece\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e34\u754c\u5b57\u957fk*\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97Zipf\u578b\u79e9\u9891\u5f8bp(r)\u221dr^{-\u03b1}\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6307\u6570\u7531\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u7a7a\u683c\u6982\u7387\u663e\u5f0f\u786e\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u7edf\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7a7a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u660eZipf\u7c7b\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u7eaf\u7cb9\u4ece\u7ec4\u5408\u5b66\u548c\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6f84\u6e05\u54ea\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u51fa\u968f\u673a\u6587\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

Self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning can mitigate the data scarcity challenge to some extent. However, both of these paradigms are complex and require either hand-crafted pretexts or well-defined pseudo-labels. In contrast, data augmentation represents a relatively simple and straightforward approach to addressing data scarcity issues. It has led to significant improvements in image recognition tasks. However, the effectiveness of local image editing augmentation techniques in the context of segmentation has been less explored. We propose HSMix, a novel approach to local image editing data augmentation involving hard and soft mixing for medical semantic segmentation. In our approach, a hard-augmented image is created by combining homogeneous regions (superpixels) from two source images. A soft mixing method further adjusts the brightness of these composed regions with brightness mixing based on locally aggregated pixel-wise saliency coefficients. The ground-truth segmentation masks of the two source images undergo the same mixing operations to generate the associated masks for the augmented images. Our method fully exploits both the prior contour and saliency information, thus preserving local semantic information in the augmented images while enriching the augmentation space with more diversity. Our method is a plug-and-play solution that is model agnostic and applicable to a range of medical imaging modalities. Extensive experimental evidence has demonstrated its effectiveness in a variety of medical segmentation tasks.

Given a collection of input data flow graphs (DFGs) and a target CGRA, the framework starts with a full layout in which every processing element (PE) supports every operation in the DFGs. It then employs a branch-and-bound (BB) search to eliminate operations out of PEs, ensuring that the input DFGs successfully map onto the resulting CGRAs, eventually returning an optimized heterogeneous CGRA. Experimental evaluation with 12 DFGs and 9 target CGRA sizes reveals that the framework reduces the number of operations by 68.7% on average, resulting in a reduction of CGRA area by almost 70% and of power by over 51%, all compared to the initial full layout. HeLEx generates CGRAs that are on average only within 6.2% of theoretically minimum CGRAs that support exactly the number of operations needed by the input DFGs. A comparison with functional layouts produced by two state-of-the-art frameworks indicates that HeLEx achieves better reduction in the number of operations, by up to 2.6X.", "AI": {"tldr": "HeLEx\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u5f02\u6784\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u9635\u5217\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u754c\u641c\u7d22\u51cf\u5c11\u5904\u7406\u5355\u5143\u652f\u6301\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eCGRA\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u529f\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CGRA\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u529f\u80fd\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6620\u5c04\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316CGRA\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5e03\u5c40\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u529f\u8017\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u754c\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u5168\u529f\u80fd\u5e03\u5c40\u5f00\u59cb\u9010\u6b65\u6d88\u9664\u5904\u7406\u5355\u5143\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u56fe\u4ecd\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684CGRA\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1168.7%\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u91cf\uff0cCGRA\u9762\u79ef\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd170%\uff0c\u529f\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc751%\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684CGRA\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u76846.2%\u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "HeLEx\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316CGRA\u529f\u80fd\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6620\u5c04\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Despite substantial research efforts, conventional diagnostic approaches still face two key challenges. First, these methods predominantly adopt a joint learning paradigm for RCL and FTI to exploit shared information and reduce training time. However, this simplistic integration neglects the causal dependencies between tasks, thereby impeding inter-task collaboration and information transfer. Second, these existing methods primarily focus on point-to-point relationships between instances, overlooking the group nature of inter-instance influences induced by deployment configurations and load balancing. To overcome these limitations, we propose CCLH, a novel root cause analysis framework that orchestrates diagnostic tasks based on cascaded conditional learning. CCLH provides a three-level taxonomy for group influences between instances and incorporates a heterogeneous hypergraph to model these relationships, facilitating the simulation of failure propagation.

Generative LLMs like GPT and Claude are increasingly being used as content analytical tools, but how effective are they for frame analysis?

Our analysis rests on a novel gold standard dataset that we inductively and iteratively developed through the study, investigating six months of news coverage of the US Mpox epidemic of 2022. While we discover some potential applications for generative LLMs, we demonstrate that they were consistently outperformed by manual coders, and in some instances, by smaller language models. Some form of human validation was always necessary to determine appropriate model choice. Additionally, by examining how the suitability of various approaches depended on the nature of different tasks that were part of our frame analytical workflow, we provide insights as to how researchers may leverage the complementarity of these approaches to use them in tandem.

To address this limitation, we introduce plug-and-play multi-concept adaptive blending for high-fidelity text-to-image synthesis (PnP-MIX), an innovative, tuning-free approach designed to seamlessly embed multiple personalized concepts into a single generated image. Our method leverages guided appearance attention to faithfully reflect the intended appearance of each personalized concept. To further enhance compositional fidelity, we present a mask-guided noise mixing strategy that preserves the integrity of non-personalized regions such as the background or unrelated objects while enabling the precise integration of personalized objects. Finally, to mitigate concept leakage, i.e., the inadvertent leakage of personalized concept features into other regions, we propose background dilution++, a novel strategy that effectively reduces such leakage and promotes accurate localization of features within personalized regions.

These attacks, called Meltdown and Spectre, exploit the side effects of performance-enhancing features in modern microprocessors to expose secret data through side channels in the microarchitecture. The well known implementations of these attacks exploit cache-based side channels since they are the least noisy channels to exfiltrate data. While some software patches attempted to mitigate these attacks, they are ad-hoc and only try to fix the side effects of the vulnerabilites. They may also impose a performance overhead of up to 30%. In this paper, we present a microarchitecture-based solution for Meltdown and Spectre that addresses the vulnerabilities exploited by the attacks. Our solution prevents flushed instructions from exposing data to the cache. Our approach can also be extended to other memory structures in the microarchitecture thereby preventing variants of the attacks which exploit these memory structures. We further identify two new variant attacks based on exploiting the side effects of speculative and out-of-order execution and show how our solution can be used to prevent these attacks. Evaluation results show that our microarchitectural solution not only restores secure out-of-order and speculative execution, but also has relatively low overhead and does not significantly impact performance for most applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9Meltdown\u548cSpectre\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9632\u6b62\u5237\u65b0\u6307\u4ee4\u5411\u7f13\u5b58\u66b4\u9732\u6570\u636e\u6765\u4fee\u590d\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u4e71\u5e8f\u6267\u884c\u548c\u63a8\u6d4b\u6267\u884c\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8865\u4e01\u65b9\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u53ea\u662f\u4e34\u65f6\u4fee\u590d\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u963b\u6b62\u5237\u65b0\u6307\u4ee4\u5411\u7f13\u5b58\u66b4\u9732\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u5185\u5b58\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u53d8\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4e71\u5e8f\u548c\u63a8\u6d4b\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1Meltdown\u548cSpectre\u653b\u51fb\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u79cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u5904\u7406\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, most existing annotations are event-centric, which restricts the model's ability to capture the comprehensive context of a scene. The lack of fundamental information such as object categories, spatial configurations, and descriptive visual attributes prevents the model from forming a complete understanding of the environment, ultimately limiting its generalization and reasoning capability. In this paper, we introduce Foundational Question Generation for Video Question Answering via an Embedding-Integrated Approach (FIQ), a framework designed to enhance the reasoning capability of VQA models by improving their foundational comprehension of video content. FIQ generates Q&A pairs from descriptive information extracted directly from videos, thereby enriching the dataset with core scene-level attributes. These generated pairs help the model develop a more holistic understanding of the video, leading to improved generalizability and reasoning performance. In addition, we propose a VQ-CAlign module that aligns task-specific question embeddings with corresponding visual features, preserving essential contextual cues and enhancing adaptability to downstream tasks.

To circumvent this limitation, we revisit bounding box representation and propose corner-aligned regression, which shifts the prediction target from unstable centers to geometrically informative corners that reside in dense, observable regions. Leveraging the inherent geometric constraints among corners and image 2D boxes, partial parameters of 3D bounding boxes can be recovered from corner annotations, enabling a weakly supervised paradigm without requiring complete 3D labels. We design a simple yet effective corner-aware detection head that can be plugged into existing detectors.

The proposed PUF generates device-specific responses by measuring the pull-up and pull-down resistor values on the I/O pins of the ICs, which naturally vary across chips due to manufacturing-induced process variations. Since these resistors are already integrated into the I/O structures of most ICs, ioPUF+ requires no custom circuitry, and no new IC fabrication. This makes ioPUF+ suitable for cost-sensitive embedded systems built from Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. Beyond introducing a new PUF, ioPUF+ includes a complete datapath for converting raw PUF responses into cryptographically usable secret keys using BCH error correction and SHA-256 hashing. Further ioPUF+ also demonstrate a practical use case of PUF derive secret keys in securing device-to-device communication using AES-encryption. We implemented ioPUF+ on the Infineon PSoC-5 microcontroller and evaluated its performance across 30 devices using standard PUF metrics. The results show excellent reliability (intra-device Hamming distance of 100.00%), strong uniqueness (inter-device Hamming distance of 50.33%), near-ideal uniformity (50.54%), and negligible bit aliasing.

While alternating the LoRA matrices has been shown to stabilize aggregation in centralized FL, extending this mechanism to decentralized, peer-to-peer communication introduces new challenges due to phase-state mismatch and block-wise divergence across clients. We introduce ADF-LoRA, which synchronizes the update of only one low-rank matrix per round and mixes both matrices to maintain more consistent parameter states under decentralized propagation. This design preserves the cross-term suppression effect of alternating updates while improving stability in serverless topologies. We provide a convergence analysis under standard smoothness assumptions and evaluate ADF-LoRA on multiple GLUE tasks.

Previous work, like IBM Project Debater, focused on generating persuasive speeches in simplified and shortened debate formats intended for relatively lay audiences. We introduce DeepDebater, a novel autonomous system capable of participating in and winning a full, unmodified, two-team competitive policy debate. Our system employs a hierarchical architecture of specialized multi-agent workflows, where teams of LLM-powered agents collaborate and critique one another to perform discrete argumentative tasks. Each workflow utilizes iterative retrieval, synthesis, and self-correction using a massive corpus of policy debate evidence (OpenDebateEvidence) and produces complete speech transcripts, cross-examinations, and rebuttals. We introduce a live, interactive end-to-end presentation pipeline that renders debates with AI speech and animation: transcripts are surface-realized and synthesized to audio with OpenAI TTS, and then displayed as talking-head portrait videos with EchoMimic V1. Beyond fully autonomous matches (AI vs AI), DeepDebater supports hybrid human-AI operation: human debaters can intervene at any stage, and humans can optionally serve as opponents against AI in any speech, allowing AI-human and AI-AI rounds. In preliminary evaluations against human-authored cases, DeepDebater produces qualitatively superior argumentative components and consistently wins simulated rounds as adjudicated by an independent autonomous judge. Expert human debate coaches also prefer the arguments, evidence, and cases constructed by DeepDebater.

To address this, we propose a 1.58-bit convolution to enhance expressiveness and a pre-BN residual connection to stabilize optimization by improving the Hessian condition number. These innovations enable, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful binarization of depth-wise convolutions in BNNs.

Over the years, many new video codecs such as H.265/HEVC, VP9, and AV1 were added to the latest GPU boards. Recently, the rise of live video content such as VTuber, game live-streaming, and live event broadcasts, drives the demand for high-efficiency hardware encoders in the GPUs to tackle these real-time video encoding tasks, especially at higher resolutions such as 4K/8K UHD. In this paper, RD performance, encoding speed, as well as power consumption of hardware encoders in several generations of NVIDIA, Intel GPUs as well as Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile SoCs were evaluated and compared to the software counterparts, including the latest H.266/VVC codec, using several metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and machine-learning based VMAF. The results show that modern GPU hardware encoders can match the RD performance of software encoders in real-time encoding scenarios, and while encoding speed increased in newer hardware, there is mostly negligible RD performance improvement between hardware generations.

However, sequential split learning suffers from poor scalability, while parallel variants like parallel split learning and split federated learning often incur high server resource overhead due to model duplication and aggregation, and generally exhibit reduced model performance and convergence owing to factors like client drift and lag. To address these limitations, we introduce CycleSL, a novel aggregation-free split learning framework that enhances scalability and performance and can be seamlessly integrated with existing methods. Inspired by alternating block coordinate descent, CycleSL treats server-side training as an independent higher-level machine learning task, resampling client-extracted features (smashed data) to mitigate heterogeneity and drift. It then performs cyclical updates, namely optimizing the server model first, followed by client updates using the updated server for gradient computation. We integrate CycleSL into previous algorithms and benchmark them on five publicly available datasets with non-iid data distribution and partial client attendance. Our empirical findings highlight the effectiveness of CycleSL in enhancing model performance.

Existing pre-generation filters rely on heuristics or uncalibrated LLM confidence scores, offering no statistical control over retained evidence. We evaluate and demonstrate context engineering through conformal prediction, a coverage-controlled filtering framework that removes irrelevant content while preserving recall of supporting evidence. Using both embedding- and LLM-based scoring functions, we test this approach on the NeuCLIR and RAGTIME collections. Conformal filtering consistently meets its target coverage, ensuring that a specified fraction of relevant snippets are retained, and reduces retained context by 2-3x relative to unfiltered retrieval. On NeuCLIR, downstream factual accuracy measured by ARGUE F1 improves under strict filtering and remains stable at moderate coverage, indicating that most discarded material is redundant or irrelevant.

For training involving many images, it can lead to a high computational cost. The core innovation is a cross-matrix Krylov projection method that exploits mathematical similarities between matrices, using a shared subspace built from ``seed\" matrices to rapidly solve for subsequent ``target\" matrices.

However, the complexity of the branch-and-bound (B&B) framework and the numerous effective algorithm components in MILP solvers make it difficult to parallelize. In this study, a scalable parallel framework, N2N (a node-to-node framework that maps the B&B nodes to distributed computing nodes), was proposed to solve large-scale problems in a distributed memory computing environment. Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively.

Efforts for modeling complex relation semantics in heterogeneous graphs are restricted by the limitations of predefined semantic dependencies and the scarcity of supervised signals. The advanced pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm leverages graph structure to provide rich self-supervised signals, but introduces semantic gaps between tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential to address the semantic issues of relations and tasks in heterogeneous graphs through their strong reasoning capabilities in textual modality, but their incorporation into heterogeneous graphs is largely limited by computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Efficient LLM-Aware (ELLA) framework for heterogeneous graphs, addressing the above issues. To capture complex relation semantics, we propose an LLM-aware Relation Tokenizer that leverages LLM to encode multi-hop, multi-type relations. To reduce computational complexity, we further employ a Hop-level Relation Graph Transformer, which help reduces the complexity of LLM-aware relation reasoning from exponential to linear. To bridge semantic gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, we introduce the fine-grained task-aware textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Extensive experiments on four heterogeneous graphs show that our proposed ELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the performance and efficiency. In particular, ELLA scales up to 13b-parameter LLMs and achieves up to a 4x speedup compared with existing LLM-based methods.

Activation-based methods play a fundamental role in OOD detection by mitigating anomalous activations and enhancing the separation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data. However, existing methods apply activation rectification while often overlooking channel's intrinsic characteristics and distributional skewness, which results in inaccurate typical set estimation. This discrepancy can lead to the improper inclusion of anomalous activations across channels. To address this limitation, we propose a typical set refinement method based on discriminability and activity, which rectifies activations into a channel-aware typical set. Furthermore, we introduce a skewness-based refinement to mitigate distributional bias in typical set estimation. Finally, we leverage the rectified activations to compute the energy score for OOD detection.

Traditional federated learning often lacks personalization, as a single global model cannot capture client-specific characteristics, leading to biased predictions and poor generalization, especially for clients with highly divergent data distributions.\n  To address these issues, we propose FedSTAR, a style-aware federated learning framework that disentangles client-specific style factors from shared content representations. FedSTAR aggregates class-wise prototypes using a Transformer-based attention mechanism, allowing the server to adaptively weight client contributions while preserving personalization.\n  Furthermore, by exchanging compact prototypes and style vectors instead of full model parameters, FedSTAR significantly reduces communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that combining content-style disentanglement with attention-driven prototype aggregation improves personalization and robustness in heterogeneous environments without increasing communication cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedSTAR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u98ce\u683c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u98ce\u683c\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5bb9\u8868\u793a\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u3001\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u805a\u5408\u7c7b\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u98ce\u683c\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5bb9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u6362\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u539f\u578b\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u5411\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u5bb9-\u98ce\u683c\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u539f\u578b\u805a\u5408\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "FedSTAR\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u683c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Recent test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) methods derive label-free pseudo-rewards from self-consistency voting over sampled trajectories, yet they often collapse: the majority-vote reward prevails, responses shorten, and Pass@1 declines. We trace this to uniform sequence updates in which most tokens are low-entropy followers, while a small high-entropy subset determines the reasoning branches. Thus we propose SPINE, a token-selective test-time reinforcement learning framework that (i) updates only forking tokens, the high-entropy branch points identified from forward-pass statistics, and (ii) applies an entropy-band regularizer at those tokens to sustain exploration when entropy is too low and to suppress noisy supervision when it is too high. SPINE plugs into GRPO-style objectives, optionally with a KL anchor, and requires no labels or reward models. Across ten benchmarks spanning multimodal VQA, general and expert QA, mathematical reasoning, and medical QA, SPINE consistently improves Pass@1 over TTRL while avoiding response-length collapse and yielding more stable training dynamics on both LLM and MLLM backbones. These results indicate that aligning updates with chain-of-thought branch points is a simple and label-free mechanism for stable and effective test-time adaptation in reasoning models.

We introduce SWITCH (Semantic World Interface Tasks for Control and Handling), an embodied, task-driven benchmark created through iterative releases to probe these gaps.

Across 351 tasks spanning 98 real devices and appliances, commercial and open LMMMs exhibit inconsistent performance even on single-step interactions, often over-relying on textual cues and under-using visual or video evidence (and high aggregate scores can mask such failures).

Prior work attempts to detect hallucination with model-internal signals such as token-level entropy or generation consistency, while the connection between pretraining data exposure and hallucination is underexplored. Existing studies show that LLMs underperform on long-tail knowledge, i.e., the accuracy of the generated answer drops for the ground-truth entities that are rare in pretraining. However, examining whether data coverage itself can serve as a detection signal is overlooked. We propose a complementary question: Does lexical training-data coverage of the question and/or generated answer provide additional signal for hallucination detection? To investigate this, we construct scalable suffix arrays over RedPajama's 1.3-trillion-token pretraining corpus to retrieve $n$-gram statistics for both prompts and model generations. We evaluate their effectiveness for hallucination detection across three QA benchmarks. Our observations show that while occurrence-based features are weak predictors when used alone, they yield modest gains when combined with log-probabilities, particularly on datasets with higher intrinsic model uncertainty.

The study moves the needle forward in a number of ways, including (1) full standardization of assessment with respect to preprocessing, training sets/protocols (optimizing networks with the AdamW optimizer, CosineAnnealingLR, patiene for early stopping = 7), and metrics to assess performance were identical along all models; (2) a high level of confidence in the localizations based on prior studies as both Grad-CAM and GradientShap explanation were used to establish anatomically important and meaningful attention regions and address the black-box issue; (3) a compact 1.31 million parameter CNN was developed that achieved 96.49% testing accuracy and was 100 times smaller than Inception-ResNet V2 while permitting real-time inference (375ms) on edge devices; (4) full evaluation beyond accuracy reporting based on measures of intersection over union, Hausdorff distance, and precision-recall curves, and confusion matrices across all splits. Inception-ResNet V2 reached state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 99.53% accuracy on testing and obtaining a precision, recall, and F1-score of at least 99.50% dominant performance based on metrics of recent studies. We demonstrated a lightweight model that is suitable to deploy on devices that do not have multi-GPU infrastructure in under-resourced settings.

Although continual learning approaches have been studied for various applications, targeted research on continual learning approaches specifically designed for medical vision-language tasks remains underexplored. We propose MedPEFT-CL, a parameter-efficient continual learning framework that addresses both efficient learning of new tasks and preservation of previous knowledge through a dual-phase architecture based on CLIPSeg. Our dual-phase architecture features an adaptive learning phase that employs semantic similarity-based adapter allocation and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for medical tasks through prompt similarity analysis, and a knowledge consolidation phase employing bi-directional Fisher-memory coordination. This creates a reinforcing cycle: consolidation directs replay priorities while new tasks provide challenging samples that improve retention strategies. Our key contributions are: (1) a semantic-driven adapter allocation mechanism that enables efficient learning of new medical tasks, (2) a bi-modal LoRA adaptation that significantly reduces trainable parameters while maintaining cross-modal learning, and (3) bidirectional Fisher-memory coordination that prevents catastrophic forgetting from previous medical tasks.

This paper presents Blu-WERP, a novel data preprocessing pipeline designed to optimize the quality of Common Crawl WARC files for LLM training. We demonstrate that Blu-WERP significantly outperforms established baselines including DCLM across multiple model scales and evaluation benchmarks. Our pipeline processes CC WARC dumps, implementing advanced filtering and quality assessment mechanisms. We conducted comprehensive evaluations using models with 150M, 400M, 530M, 750M, and 1B parameters, testing against nine standard benchmarks categorized as World Knowledge & Reasoning, Language Understanding, and Commonsense Reasoning. Results show Blu-WERP consistently achieved superior performance across all model scales. At the 1B parameter scale, Relatively Blu-WERP demonstrates a 4.0% and 9.5% aggregate improvement over DCLM and Fineweb respectively, while achieving quality-per-token efficiency gain. Categorical analysis reveals 2.4% improvement in World Knowledge & Reasoning, 6.2% improvement in Language Understanding, and 4.2% improvement in Commonsense Reasoning.

RMOT benchmarks only describe the object's appearance, relative positions, and initial motion states. This so-called static regulation fails to capture dynamic changes of the object motion, including velocity changes and motion direction shifts. This limitation not only causes a temporal discrepancy between static references and dynamic vision modality but also constrains multi-modal tracking performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Vision-Motion-Reference aligned RMOT framework, named VMRMOT. It integrates a motion modality extracted from object dynamics to enhance the alignment between vision modality and language references through multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we introduce motion-aware descriptions derived from object dynamic behaviors and, leveraging the powerful temporal-reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, extract motion features as the motion modality. We further design a Vision-Motion-Reference Alignment (VMRA) module to hierarchically align visual queries with motion and reference cues, enhancing their cross-modal consistency.

Previous work identified two types of attention heads that disentangle this information: (i) Concept induction heads, which copy word meanings, and (ii) Token induction heads, which copy literal token representations (Feucht et al., 2025). We show that these heads can be used to identify subspaces of model activations that exhibit coherent semantic structure in Llama-2-7b. Specifically, when we transform hidden states using the attention weights of concept heads, we are able to more accurately perform parallelogram arithmetic (Mikolov et al., 2013) on the resulting hidden states, e.g., showing that \"Athens\" - \"Greece\" + \"China\" = \"Beijing\". This transformation allows for much higher nearest-neighbor accuracy (80%) than direct use of raw hidden states (47%).

We use controlled experiments with repeated textual and visual items and analyze model behavior through causal mediation and activation patching. To this end, we design a specialized tool, CountScope, for mechanistic interpretability of numerical content. Results show that individual tokens or visual features encode latent positional count information that can be extracted and transferred across contexts. Layerwise analyses reveal a progressive emergence of numerical representations, with lower layers encoding small counts and higher layers representing larger ones. We identify an internal counter mechanism that updates with each item, stored mainly in the final token or region and transferable between contexts. In LVLMs, numerical information also appears in visual embeddings, shifting between background and foreground regions depending on spatial composition. Models rely on structural cues such as separators in text, which act as shortcuts for tracking item counts and influence the accuracy of numerical predictions.

However, existing work lacks systematic comparison of vector-based and non-vector RAG architectures for financial documents, and the empirical impact of advanced RAG techniques on retrieval accuracy, answer quality, latency, and cost remain unclear. We present the first systematic evaluation comparing vector-based agentic RAG using hybrid search and metadata filtering against hierarchical node-based systems that traverse document structure without embeddings. We evaluate two enhancement techniques applied to the vector-based architecture, i) cross-encoder reranking for retrieval precision, and ii) small-to-big chunk retrieval for context completeness. Across 1,200 SEC 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings on a 150-question benchmark, we measure retrieval metrics (MRR, Recall@5), answer quality through LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons, latency, and preprocessing costs. Vector-based agentic RAG achieves a 68% win rate over hierarchical node-based systems with comparable latency (5.2 compared to 5.98 seconds). Cross-encoder reranking achieves a 59% absolute improvement at optimal parameters (10, 5) for MRR@5. Small-to-big retrieval achieves a 65% win rate over baseline chunking with only 0.2 seconds additional latency.

A Synthetic Benchmark and Analysis of Attention-Based Interventions", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Recent research suggests that Vision Language Models (VLMs) often rely on inherent biases learned during training when responding to queries about visual properties of images. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly specific questions that require them to focus on particular areas of the image in tasks such as counting. We build upon this research by developing a synthetic benchmark dataset and evaluation framework to systematically determine how counting performance varies as image and prompt properties change. Using open-source VLMs, we then analyze how attention allocation fluctuates with varying input parameters (e.g. number of objects in the image, objects color, background color, objects texture, background texture, and prompt specificity). We further implement attention-based interventions to modulate focus on visual tokens at different layers and evaluate their impact on counting performance across a range of visual conditions. Our experiments reveal that while VLM counting performance remains challenging, especially under high visual or linguistic complexity, certain attention interventions can lead to modest gains in counting performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5c5e\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u8ba1\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u5173\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u4f1a\u66f4\u52a0\u660e\u663e\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u914d\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u8f93\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u7126\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u6216\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f46\u67d0\u4e9b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8ba1\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5e26\u6765\u9002\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6539\u5584\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Choudhury", "Vicente Grau", "Abhirup Banerjee"], "title": "AngioDG: Interpretable Channel-informed Feature-modulated Single-source Domain Generalization for Coronary Vessel Segmentation in X-ray Angiography", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, with X-ray Coronary Angiography (XCA) as the gold standard during real-time cardiac interventions. Segmentation of coronary vessels from XCA can facilitate downstream quantitative assessments, such as measurement of the stenosis severity and enhancing clinical decision-making. However, developing generalizable vessel segmentation models for XCA is challenging due to variations in imaging protocols and patient demographics that cause domain shifts. These limitations are exacerbated by the lack of annotated datasets, making Single-source Domain Generalization (SDG) a necessary solution for achieving generalization. Existing SDG methods are largely augmentation-based, which may not guarantee the mitigation of overfitting to augmented or synthetic domains. We propose a novel approach, ``AngioDG\", to bridge this gap by channel regularization strategy to promote generalization. Our method identifies the contributions of early feature channels to task-specific metrics for DG, facilitating interpretability, and then reweights channels to calibrate and amplify domain-invariant features while attenuating domain-specific ones. We evaluate AngioDG on 6 x-ray angiography datasets for coronary vessels segmentation, achieving the best out-of-distribution performance among the compared methods, while maintaining consistent in-domain test performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAngioDG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u9053\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3X\u5c04\u7ebf\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9020\u5f71\u8840\u7ba1\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u6e90\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u662f\u5168\u7403\u4e3b\u8981\u6b7b\u56e0\uff0cXCA\u662f\u5b9e\u65f6\u5fc3\u810f\u4ecb\u5165\u7684\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6210\u50cf\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u57df\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4e14\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5355\u6e90\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5bf9\u589e\u5f3a\u6216\u5408\u6210\u57df\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAngioDG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u901a\u9053\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u8bc6\u522b\u65e9\u671f\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u9053\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u6807\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u901a\u9053\u4ee5\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u653e\u5927\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8870\u51cf\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u57286\u4e2aX\u5c04\u7ebf\u8840\u7ba1\u9020\u5f71\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u5916\u5206\u5e03\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u57df\u5185\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AngioDG\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u9053\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u8840\u7ba1\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u57df\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Much of this knowledge stems from discontinued programs, and reusing these archives is invaluable for reverse translation. However, in practice, such reuse is often infeasible. In this work, we introduce DiscoVerse, a multi-agent co-scientist designed to support pharmaceutical research and development. The system implements semantic retrieval, cross-document linking, and auditable synthesis on a large historical corpus from Roche. To validate our approach at real-world scale, we selected a subset of 180 molecules from the Roche research repositories, covering over 0.87 billion BPE tokens and more than four decades of research. Given that automated evaluation metrics are poorly aligned with scientific utility, we evaluate the performance of DiscoVerse using blinded expert evaluation of source-linked outputs. To our knowledge, this is the first agentic framework systematically assessed on real pharmaceutical data for reverse translation, enabled by authorized access to confidential, end-to-end drug-development archives. Our contributions include role-specialized agent designs aligned with scientist workflows; human-in-the-loop support for reverse translation; expert evaluation; and a large-scale demonstration showing promising answer accuracy and decision-making insights. In brief, across seven benchmark queries covering 180 molecules, DiscoVerse achieved near-perfect recall ($\\geq 0.99$) with moderate precision ($0.71-0.91$), while qualitative assessments of discontinuation rationale and organ-specific toxicity showed faithful, source-linked synthesis across preclinical and clinical evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiscoVerse\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u836f\u7269\u7814\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u9006\u5411\u8f6c\u5316\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u8de8\u6587\u6863\u94fe\u63a5\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5408\u6210\u6765\u5904\u7406\u5927\u578b\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u836f\u7269\u7814\u53d1\u79ef\u7d2f\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8bb8\u591a\u6765\u81ea\u5df2\u7ec8\u6b62\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u3002\u91cd\u65b0\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6863\u6848\u5bf9\u9006\u5411\u8f6c\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86DiscoVerse\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u8de8\u6587\u6863\u94fe\u63a5\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u7f57\u6c0f\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u5927\u578b\u5386\u53f2\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6180\u4e2a\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u8d85\u8fc78.7\u4ebfBPE\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\uff0cDiscoVerse\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387(\u22650.99)\u548c\u4e2d\u7b49\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6(0.71-0.91)\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ec8\u6b62\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u5668\u5b98\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6bd2\u6027\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u591f\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u6e90\u94fe\u63a5\u5408\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u836f\u7269\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u7814\u53d1\u7684\u9006\u5411\u8f6c\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Here, we apply VLMs to two fundamental challenges in data-driven stroke rehabilitation: automatic quantification of rehabilitation dose and impairment from videos. We formulate these problems as motion-identification tasks, which can be addressed using VLMs. We evaluate our proposed framework on a cohort of 29 healthy controls and 51 stroke survivors. Our results show that current VLMs lack the fine-grained motion understanding required for precise quantification: dose estimates are comparable to a baseline that excludes visual information, and impairment scores cannot be reliably predicted. Nevertheless, several findings suggest future promise. With optimized prompting and post-processing, VLMs can classify high-level activities from a few frames, detect motion and grasp with moderate accuracy, and approximate dose counts within 25% of ground truth for mildly impaired and healthy participants, all without task-specific training or finetuning.

Fine-tuning the state-of-the-art Qwen2.5-VL model on VisReason and VisReason-Pro yields substantial improvements in step-by-step visual reasoning accuracy, interpretability, and cross-benchmark generalization.

Automated question answering systems over such codes enable quick and accurate access to specific regulatory clauses, improving efficiency and reducing errors. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are essential for this task as they combine the precision of information retrieval with the generative capabilities of language models. However, tabular data are challenging to extract as they often involve complex layouts, merged cells, multi-row headers, and embedded semantic relationships that are not easily captured by traditional natural language processing techniques and Vision Language Models (VLMs). This paper explores and compares two methods for extracting information from tabular data in building codes using several pre-trained VLMs. First, a direct input method is used, where the image of the page is input directly into the VLMs, which are then tasked with answering questions based on the image. Second, an indirect input method is introduced, which involves converting an image of a page containing tables into the LaTeX code and then answering inquires based on the LaTeX-based input. The experiments find that the direct input method generally resulted in higher accuracy than the indirect input method. To further improve the performance, we fine-tuned each VLM using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a domain-specific tabular dataset. The fine-tuned models exhibited substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct achieving relative accuracy gains exceeding 100%.

Large-scale, weakly-supervised datasets in language and vision have driven the development of foundation models whose internal representations encode structure (patterns, co-occurrences and statistical regularities) beyond their training objectives. Most existing methods extract structure only for pre-specified targets; they excel at confirmation but do not support open-ended discovery of unknown patterns. We ask whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can enable open-ended feature discovery from foundation model representations. We evaluate this question in controlled rediscovery studies, where the learned SAE features are tested for alignment with semantic concepts on a standard segmentation benchmark and compared against strong label-free alternatives on concept-alignment metrics. Applied to ecological imagery, the same procedure surfaces fine-grained anatomical structure without access to segmentation or part labels, providing a scientific case study with ground-truth validation. While our experiments focus on vision with an ecology case study, the method is domain-agnostic and applicable to models in other sciences (e.g., proteins, genomics, weather).

We introduce Path-Constrained Retrieval (PCR), a retrieval method that combines structural graph constraints with semantic search to ensure retrieved information maintains logical relationships within a knowledge graph. PCR restricts the search space to nodes reachable from an anchor node, preventing retrieval of structurally disconnected information that may lead to inconsistent reasoning. We evaluate PCR on PathRAG-6, a benchmark spanning six domains with 180 nodes and 360 edges. Our results show that PCR achieves full structural consistency compared to 24-32 percent in baseline methods, while maintaining strong relevance scores.

While effective adversarial masking methods have been developed for 2D images, a significant gap remains in achieving robust, viewpoint-consistent identity protection for dynamic 3D avatars. To address this, we present AEGIS, the first privacy-preserving identity masking framework for 3D Gaussian Avatars that maintains the subject's perceived characteristics. Our method aims to conceal identity-related facial features while preserving the avatar's perceptual realism and functional integrity. AEGIS applies adversarial perturbations to the Gaussian color coefficients, guided by a pre-trained face verification network, ensuring consistent protection across multiple viewpoints without retraining or modifying the avatar's geometry. AEGIS achieves complete de-identification, reducing face retrieval and verification accuracy to 0%, while maintaining high perceptual quality (SSIM = 0.9555, PSNR = 35.52 dB).

However, unconstrained feature matching across domains such as aerial, indoor, and outdoor scenes remains challenging due to large variations in appearance, scale and viewpoint. Feature matching has been conventionally formulated as a 2D-to-2D problem; however, recent 3D foundation models provides spatial feature matching properties based on two-view geometry. While powerful, we observe that these spatially coherent matches often concentrate on dominant planar regions, e.g., walls or ground surfaces, while being less sensitive to fine-grained geometric details, particularly under large viewpoint changes. To better understand these trade-offs, we first perform linear probe experiments to evaluate the performance of various vision foundation models for image matching. Building on these insights, we introduce SPIDER, a universal feature matching framework that integrates a shared feature extraction backbone with two specialized network heads for estimating both 2D-based and 3D-based correspondences from coarse to fine.

Recent multimodal language models have advanced instruction following segmentation, yet generalization remains limited. The key bottleneck is the high cost of curating diverse, high-quality pixel annotations paired with rich linguistic supervision leading to brittle performance under distribution shift. Therefore, we present CORA, a semi-supervised reasoning segmentation framework that jointly learns from limited labeled data and a large corpus of unlabeled images. CORA introduces three main components: 1) conditional visual instructions that encode spatial and contextual relationships between objects; 2) a noisy pseudo-label filter based on the consistency of Multimodal LLM's outputs across semantically equivalent queries; and 3) a token-level contrastive alignment between labeled and pseudo-labeled samples to enhance feature consistency. These components enable CORA to perform robust reasoning segmentation with minimal supervision, outperforming existing baselines under constrained annotation settings. CORA achieves state-of-the-art results, requiring as few as 100 labeled images on Cityscapes, a benchmark dataset for urban scene understanding, surpassing the baseline by $+2.3\\%$.

To investigate these issues, two complementary studies were carried out on Twitter and Facebook, combining quantitative analyses of digital traces with online observation and interviews. This mixed-methods design avoids reducing users to single reactions to identified fake items and instead examines the variety of practices across different interactional situations, online and offline, while recording socio-demographic traits. The first study mapped users who shared at least one item labeled fake by fact-checkers in the French Twittersphere. The second used a corpus of items flagged by Facebook users to study reactions to statements whose epistemic status is uncertain. Three main findings emerge. First, sharing fake news is concentrated among a limited group of users who are not less educated or cognitively disadvantaged but are more politicized and critical of institutions; owing to their high activity and prolific sharing, they can help set the agenda for their political camp. Second, exposed users can deploy varying forms of critical distance depending on their social position and the interactional norms of the situations they inhabit: either discursive caution (prudence \u00e9nonciative) or interventions ('points d'arr\u00eat') that express disagreement or corrections. Third, these forms of critical distance seldom yield genuine deliberative debates or agonistic pluralism; rather, they often produce dialogues of the deaf among a small, particularly active minority.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u5206\u4eab\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u9ad8\u5ea6\u653f\u6cbb\u5316\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7528\u6237\u5e76\u975e\u6559\u80b2\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4f4e\u6216\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5bf9\u5236\u5ea6\u6301\u6279\u8bc4\u6001\u5ea6\u3002\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5176\u793e\u4f1a\u5730\u4f4d\u548c\u4e92\u52a8\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u4ea7\u751f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5ba1\u8bae\u6027\u8fa9\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u4e2a\u6096\u8bba\uff1a\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u53ea\u5360\u4fe1\u606f\u6d88\u8d39\u7684\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u653f\u6cbb\u6781\u5316\u52a0\u5267\u800c\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u5e76\u4e0d\u7279\u522b\u654f\u611f\u3002", "method": "\u5728Twitter\u548cFacebook\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b57\u75d5\u8ff9\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e0d\u540c\u4e92\u52a8\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "result": "1. \u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u5206\u4eab\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u5316\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\uff1b2. \u7528\u6237\u6839\u636e\u793e\u4f1a\u5730\u4f4d\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u91c7\u53d6\u4e0d\u540c\u6279\u5224\u8ddd\u79bb\uff1b3. \u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e92\u52a8\u5f88\u5c11\u4ea7\u751f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5ba1\u8bae\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5f62\u6210'\u804b\u5b50\u5bf9\u8bdd'\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u5c11\u6570\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7528\u6237\u7684\u8bae\u7a0b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u5e94\u53d7\u793e\u4f1a\u5730\u4f4d\u548c\u4e92\u52a8\u60c5\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u4fc3\u6210\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u516c\u5171\u8fa9\u8bba\u3002"}}

Qureshi"], "title": "Latent Dirichlet Transformer VAE for Hyperspectral Unmixing with Bundled Endmembers", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Hyperspectral images capture rich spectral information that enables per-pixel material identification; however, spectral mixing often obscures pure material signatures. To address this challenge, we propose the Latent Dirichlet Transformer Variational Autoencoder (LDVAE-T) for hyperspectral unmixing. Our model combines the global context modeling capabilities of transformer architectures with physically meaningful constraints imposed by a Dirichlet prior in the latent space. This prior naturally enforces the sum-to-one and non-negativity conditions essential for abundance estimation, thereby improving the quality of predicted mixing ratios. A key contribution of LDVAE-T is its treatment of materials as bundled endmembers, rather than relying on fixed ground truth spectra. In the proposed method our decoder predicts, for each endmember and each patch, a mean spectrum together with a structured (segmentwise) covariance that captures correlated spectral variability. Reconstructions are formed by mixing these learned bundles with Dirichlet-distributed abundances garnered from a transformer encoder, allowing the model to represent intrinsic material variability while preserving physical interpretability. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, Samson, Jasper Ridge, and HYDICE Urban and show that LDVAE-T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in abundance estimation and endmember extraction, as measured by root mean squared error and spectral angle distance, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LDVAE-T\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u89e3\u6df7\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5c06\u6750\u6599\u89c6\u4e3a\u6346\u7ed1\u7aef\u5143\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6df7\u5408\u4f1a\u63a9\u76d6\u7eaf\u6750\u6599\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u6750\u6599\u5185\u5728\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u6df7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7aef\u5143\u548c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8865\u4e01\u9884\u6d4b\u5747\u503c\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6346\u7ed1\u7aef\u5143\u5f62\u6210\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5728Samson\u3001Jasper Ridge\u548cHYDICE Urban\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cLDVAE-T\u5728\u4e30\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7aef\u5143\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u901a\u8fc7\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u89d2\u8ddd\u79bb\u8861\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "LDVAE-T\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u89e3\u6df7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u793a\u6750\u6599\u5185\u5728\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

However, clinical texts are often degraded by human errors or failures in automated pipelines, raising concerns about the reliability and fairness of AI-assisted decision-making. Yet the impact of such degradations remains under-investigated, particularly regarding how noise-induced shifts can heighten predictive uncertainty and unevenly affect demographic subgroups. We present a systematic study of state-of-the-art LLMs under diverse text corruption scenarios, focusing on robustness and equity in next-visit diagnosis prediction. To address the challenge posed by the large diagnostic label space, we introduce a clinically grounded label-reduction scheme and a hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT) strategy that emulates clinicians' reasoning.

While deepfake detection has been extensively studied in facial contexts, satellite imagery presents distinct challenges, including terrain-level inconsistencies and structural artifacts. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) for detecting AI-generated satellite images. Using a curated dataset of over 130,000 labeled RGB images from the DM-AER and FSI datasets, we show that ViTs significantly outperform CNNs in both accuracy (95.11 percent vs. 87.02 percent) and overall robustness, owing to their ability to model long-range dependencies and global semantic structures. We further enhance model transparency using architecture-specific interpretability methods, including Grad-CAM for CNNs and Chefer's attention attribution for ViTs, revealing distinct detection behaviors and validating model trustworthiness. Our results highlight the ViT's superior performance in detecting structural inconsistencies and repetitive textural patterns characteristic of synthetic imagery.

Building on this foundation, the BlackboxNLP 2025 Shared Task extends MIB into a community-wide reproducible comparison of MI techniques. The shared task features two tracks: circuit localization, which assesses methods that identify causally influential components and interactions driving model behavior, and causal variable localization, which evaluates approaches that map activations into interpretable features. With three teams spanning eight different methods, participants achieved notable gains in circuit localization using ensemble and regularization strategies for circuit discovery. With one team spanning two methods, participants achieved significant gains in causal variable localization using low-dimensional and non-linear projections to featurize activation vectors.

Our evaluation pipeline recovers camera motion from generated videos and measures planning performance using five complementary metrics that quantify target-reaching capability, trajectory accuracy, and directional consistency. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including Sora 2, Veo 3.1, and the Wan series. The best off-the-shelf model (Wan2.2-Flash) achieves only 0.299 overall score, revealing significant limitations in current world models for robotic planning tasks. We show that fine-tuning an open-source 5B-parameter model on only 325 scenarios from our dataset achieves 0.345 overall score -- an improvement of more than 400% over its base version (0.066) and 15% higher than the best off-the-shelf model.

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of attention patterns in efficient VLMs, revealing that concatenation-based architectures frequently fail to distinguish between semantically matching and non-matching image-text pairs. This is a key factor for object hallucination in these models. To address this, we introduce Attention-Guided Efficient Vision-Language Models (AGE-VLM), a novel framework that enhances visual grounding through interleaved cross-attention layers to instill vision capabilities in pretrained small language models. This enforces in VLM the ability \"look\" at the correct image regions by leveraging spatial knowledge distilled from the Segment Anything Model (SAM), significantly reducing hallucination. We validate our approach across different vision-centric benchmarks where our method is better or comparable to prior work on efficient VLMs. Our findings provide valuable insights for future research aimed at achieving enhanced visual and linguistic understanding in VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u62fc\u63a5\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u8bed\u4e49\u5339\u914d/\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AGE-VLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u548cSAM\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u62fc\u63a5\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u8bed\u4e49\u5339\u914d\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAGE-VLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4ea4\u9519\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528Segment Anything Model\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, most existing agentic recommender systems focus on generic single-agent plan-execute workflows or multi-agent task decomposition pipelines. Without recommendation-oriented design, they often underuse the collaborative signals in the user-item interaction history, leading to unsatisfying recommendation results. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF) framework for agentic recommendations, drawing an analogy between traditional collaborative filtering algorithms and LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, given a target user and query, we instantiate similar users and relevant items as LLM agents with unique profiles. Each agent is able to call retrieval tools, suggest candidate items, and interact with other agents. Different from the static preference aggregation in traditional collaborative filtering, MACF employs a central orchestrator agent to adaptively manage the collaboration between user and item agents via dynamic agent recruitment and personalized collaboration instruction. Experimental results on datasets from three different domains show the advantages of our MACF framework compared to strong agentic recommendation baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff08MACF\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u76f8\u7c7b\u6bd4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u62db\u52df\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u6307\u4ee4\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u7528\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6216\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a8\u8350\u5bfc\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "MACF\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u76f8\u4f3c\u7528\u6237\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u54c1\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u8c03\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u63a8\u8350\u5019\u9009\u7269\u54c1\u5e76\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u4e2d\u592e\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u62db\u52df\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u6307\u4ee4\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u7528\u6237\u548c\u7269\u54c1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMACF\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u8350\u57fa\u7ebf\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "MACF\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e0eLLM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Foundation models offer a path toward assisting with the full spectrum of radiology tasks, but existing medical models remain limited: they process volumetric CT and MRI as low-fidelity 2D slices, discard critical grayscale contrast information, and lack evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical practice. We introduce Pillar-0, a radiology foundation model pretrained on 42,990 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 86,411 chest CTs, 14,348 head CTs, and 11,543 breast MRIs from a large academic center, together with RATE, a scalable framework that extracts structured labels for 366 radiologic findings with near-perfect accuracy using LLMs. Across internal test sets of 14,230 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 10,646 chest CTs, 4,906 head CTs, and 1,585 breast MRIs, Pillar-0 establishes a new performance frontier, achieving mean AUROCs of 86.4, 88.0, 90.1, and 82.9, outperforming MedGemma (Google), MedImageInsight (Microsoft), Lingshu (Alibaba), and Merlin (Stanford) by 7.8-15.8 AUROC points and ranking best in 87.2\\% (319/366) tasks. Pillar-0 similarly outperforms all baselines in an external validation on the Stanford Abdominal CT dataset, including Merlin (82.2 vs 80.6 AUROC). Pillar-0 extends to tasks beyond its pretraining, such as long-horizon lung cancer risk prediction, where it improves upon the state-of-the-art Sybil by 3.0 C-index points on NLST, and generalizes with gains of 5.9 (MGH) and 1.9 (CGMH). In brain hemorrhage detection, Pillar-0 obtained a >95 AUROC when using only 1/20th of the data of the next most sample efficient baseline.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework called \\textbf{general agentic memory (GAM)}. GAM follows the principle of \"\\textbf{just-in time (JIT) compilation}\" where it focuses on creating optimized contexts for its client at runtime while keeping only simple but useful memory during the offline stage. To this end, GAM employs a duo-design with the following components. 1) \\textbf{Memorizer}, which highlights key historical information using a lightweight memory, while maintaining complete historical information within a universal page-store. 2) \\textbf{Researcher}, which retrieves and integrates useful information from the page-store for its online request guided by the pre-constructed memory. This design allows GAM to effectively leverage the agentic capabilities and test-time scalability of frontier large language models (LLMs), while also facilitating end-to-end performance optimization through reinforcement learning.

Despite their success on static images and short clips, current self-supervised learning methods often overlook the procedural nature that underpins such activities. We expose the lack of procedural awareness in current SSL methods with a motivating experiment: models pretrained on forward and time-reversed sequences produce highly similar features, confirming that their representations are blind to the underlying procedural order. To address this shortcoming, we propose PL-Stitch, a self-supervised framework that harnesses the inherent temporal order of video frames as a powerful supervisory signal. Our approach integrates two novel probabilistic objectives based on the Plackett-Luce (PL) model. The primary PL objective trains the model to sort sampled frames chronologically, compelling it to learn the global workflow progression. The secondary objective, a spatio-temporal jigsaw loss, complements the learning by capturing fine-grained, cross-frame object correlations. Our approach consistently achieves superior performance across five surgical and cooking benchmarks. Specifically, PL-Stitch yields significant gains in surgical phase recognition (e.g., +11.4 pp k-NN accuracy on Cholec80) and cooking action segmentation (e.g., +5.7 pp linear probing accuracy on Breakfast), demonstrating its effectiveness for procedural video representation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "PL-Stitch\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Plackett-Luce\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6982\u7387\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6d3b\u52a8\u65f6\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u6b63\u5411\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a0b\u5e8f\u610f\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPL-Stitch\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u57fa\u4e8ePlackett-Luce\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6309\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u5bf9\u91c7\u6837\u5e27\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u6b21\u8981\u76ee\u6807\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u62fc\u56fe\u635f\u5931\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8de8\u5e27\u5bf9\u8c61\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u624b\u672f\u548c\u70f9\u996a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u624b\u672f\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc6\u522b\uff08Cholec80\u4e0ak-NN\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534711.4\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff09\u548c\u70f9\u996a\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\uff08Breakfast\u4e0a\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53475.7\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "PL-Stitch\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

A core obstacle to the creation of better systems is the scarcity of benchmarks that capture the complexity of real therapeutic interactions. Most existing benchmarks either only test clinical knowledge through multiple-choice questions or assess single responses in isolation. To bridge this gap, we present MindEval, a framework designed in collaboration with Ph.D-level Licensed Clinical Psychologists for automatically evaluating language models in realistic, multi-turn mental health therapy conversations. Through patient simulation and automatic evaluation with LLMs, our framework balances resistance to gaming with reproducibility via its fully automated, model-agnostic design. We begin by quantitatively validating the realism of our simulated patients against human-generated text and by demonstrating strong correlations between automatic and human expert judgments. Then, we evaluate 12 state-of-the-art LLMs and show that all models struggle, scoring below 4 out of 6, on average, with particular weaknesses in problematic AI-specific patterns of communication. Notably, reasoning capabilities and model scale do not guarantee better performance, and systems deteriorate with longer interactions or when supporting patients with severe symptoms.

Independent sampling often yields high-variance estimates, especially when rare but with high-impact outcomes dominate the expectation. We propose an importance-weighted non-IID sampling framework that jointly draws multiple samples to cover diverse, salient regions of a flow's distribution while maintaining unbiased estimation via estimated importance weights. To balance diversity and quality, we introduce a score-based regularization for the diversity mechanism, which uses the score function, i.e., the gradient of the log probability, to ensure samples are pushed apart within high-density regions of the data manifold, mitigating off-manifold drift. We further develop the first approach for importance weighting of non-IID flow samples by learning a residual velocity field that reproduces the marginal distribution of the non-IID samples. Empirically, our method produces diverse, high-quality samples and accurate estimates of both importance weights and expectations, advancing the reliable characterization of flow-matching model outputs.

Camera-ready version to appear", "summary": "Volumetric learning underpins many 3D vision tasks such as completion, reconstruction, and mesh generation, yet training objectives still rely on Chamfer Distance (CD) or Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), which fail to balance recall and precision. We propose Quality-Aware Loss (QAL), a drop-in replacement for CD/EMD that combines a coverage-weighted nearest-neighbor term with an uncovered-ground-truth attraction term, explicitly decoupling recall and precision into tunable components.\n  Across diverse pipelines, QAL achieves consistent coverage gains, improving by an average of +4.3 pts over CD and +2.8 pts over the best alternatives. Though modest in percentage, these improvements reliably recover thin structures and under-represented regions that CD/EMD overlook. Extensive ablations confirm stable performance across hyperparameters and across output resolutions, while full retraining on PCN and ShapeNet demonstrates generalization across datasets and backbones. Moreover, QAL-trained completions yield higher grasp scores under GraspNet evaluation, showing that improved coverage translates directly into more reliable robotic manipulation.\n  QAL thus offers a principled, interpretable, and practical objective for robust 3D vision and safety-critical robotics pipelines", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faQuality-Aware Loss (QAL)\u4f5c\u4e3aChamfer Distance\u548cEarth Mover's Distance\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u6765\u6539\u55843D\u4f53\u79ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76843D\u4f53\u79ef\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff08CD\u548cEMD\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8584\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u533a\u57df\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002", "method": "QAL\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u9879\u548c\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5438\u5f15\u9879\uff0c\u5c06\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u660e\u786e\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u53ef\u8c03\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\uff0cQAL\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4CD\u63d0\u9ad84.3\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u9ad82.8\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u6062\u590d\u8584\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "QAL\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u76843D\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7ba1\u9053\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u539f\u5219\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

Yet, their behavior on structured tasks such as predicting the difficulty of competitive programming problems remains under-explored. We conduct a systematic comparison of GPT-4o, used purely as a natural-language difficulty assessor, against an interpretable Light-GBM ensemble trained on explicit numeric and textual features. On a dataset of 1,825 LeetCode problems labeled Easy, Medium, or Hard, LightGBM attains 86% accuracy, whereas GPT-4o reaches only 37.75%. Detailed analyses, including confusion matrices and SHAP-based interpretability, show that numeric constraints -- such as input size limits and acceptance rates -- play a crucial role in separating Hard problems from easier ones. By contrast, GPT-4o often overlooks these cues and exhibits a strong bias toward simpler categories. We further probe GPT-4o through a synthetic Hard-problem generation protocol. Surprisingly, GPT-4o labels almost all of its own synthetic Hard problems as Medium, contradicting its tendency to downgrade real Hard problems to Easy.

This study leverages BiomedCLIP as a foundation model to address challenges in model generalization. BiomedCLIP was adapted for automated BI-RADS breast density classification using multi-modality mammographic data (synthesized 2D images, digital mammography, and digital breast tomosynthesis). Using 96,995 images, we compared single-modality (s2D only) and multi-modality training approaches, addressing class imbalance through weighted contrastive learning. Both approaches achieved similar accuracy (multi-modality: 0.74, single-modality: 0.73), with the multi-modality model offering broader applicability across different imaging modalities and higher AUC values consistently above 0.84 across BI-RADS categories. External validation on the RSNA and EMBED datasets showed strong generalization capabilities (AUC range: 0.80-0.93).

Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) across disciplines, how well these systems generalize across diverse belief domains remains unclear. We introduce a systematic, reproducible benchmark that evaluates the ability of LLMs to predict individuals' stances on a wide range of topics in a zero-shot setting using data from an online debate platform. The benchmark includes multiple informational conditions that isolate the contribution of demographic context and known prior beliefs to predictive success. Across several small- to medium-sized models, we find that providing more background information about an individual improves predictive accuracy, but performance varies substantially across belief domains.

While prior works address this problem through either text-guided image manipulation or video prediction, these tasks are typically treated in isolation. This separation reveals a fundamental issue: image manipulation methods overlook how actions unfold over time, while video prediction models often ignore the intended outcomes. To this end, we propose ShowMe, a unified framework that enables both tasks by selectively activating the spatial and temporal components of video diffusion models. In addition, we introduce structure and motion consistency rewards to improve structural fidelity and temporal coherence. Notably, this unification brings dual benefits: the spatial knowledge gained through video pretraining enhances contextual consistency and realism in non-rigid image edits, while the instruction-guided manipulation stage equips the model with stronger goal-oriented reasoning for video prediction.

However, its practicality is severely constrained by the limited communication bandwidth. Existing approaches attempt to improve bandwidth efficiency via compression or heuristic message selection, without considering the semantic relevance or cross-agent redundancy of sensory data. We argue that a practical CP system must maximize the contribution of every transmitted bit to the final perception task, by extracting and transmitting semantically essential and non-redundant data. In this paper, we formulate a joint semantic feature encoding and transmission problem, which aims to maximize CP accuracy under limited bandwidth. To solve this problem, we introduce JigsawComm, an end-to-end trained, semantic-aware, and communication-efficient CP framework that learns to ``assemble the puzzle'' of multi-agent feature transmission. It uses a regularized encoder to extract semantically-relevant and sparse features, and a lightweight Feature Utility Estimator to predict the contribution of each agent's features to the final perception task. The resulting meta utility maps are exchanged among agents and leveraged to compute a provably optimal transmission policy, which selects features from agents with the highest utility score for each location. This policy inherently eliminates redundancy and achieves a scalable $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ communication cost as the number of agents increases.

Libraries such as DSpy (from Stanford NLP) avoid this problem through demonstration-based prompt optimisation. Inspired by this, I propose an alternative approach that treats prompt optimisation as a classical state-space search problem. I model the prompt space as a graph where nodes represent prompt states and edges correspond to deliberate transformations such as shortening, adding examples, or re- ordering content. Using beam search and random walk algorithms, I systematically explore this space, evaluating candidates on development sets and pruning unpromising branches. Across five NLP tasks (sentiment classification, question answering, summarisation, reason- ing, and natural language inference), I find that even shallow search configurations (beam width=2, depth=2) improve upon seed prompts on development sets. For instance, beam search achieves development accuracy gains from 0.40 to 0.80 on reasoning tasks, though test set improvements are more modest (0.20 to 0.50), indicating overfitting to the develop- ment heuristic. Analysis of successful optimisation paths reveals that transformations that make prompts concise appear most frequently, while verbosity operators are never selected. My results validate prompt optimization as a search problem and suggest that with greater computational resources and improved evaluation metrics, deeper exploration could yield more robust prompts that generalize beyond development sets.

OpenGloss contains 537K senses across 150K lexemes, on par with WordNet 3.1 and Open English WordNet, while providing more than four times as many sense definitions. These lexemes include 9.1M semantic edges, 1M usage examples, 3M collocations, and 60M words of encyclopedic content.\n  Generated through a multi-agent procedural generation pipeline with schema-validated LLM outputs and automated quality assurance, the entire resource was produced in under one week for under $1,000.

While various techniques aim to mitigate these biases, their effects are often evaluated only along the dimension of the bias being targeted.

We study four bias mitigation techniques applied across ten models from seven model families, and we explore racial, religious, profession- and gender-related biases. We measure the impact of debiasing on model coherence and stereotypical preference using the StereoSet benchmark. Our results consistently show that while targeted mitigation can sometimes reduce bias in the intended dimension, it frequently leads to unintended and often negative consequences in others, such as increasing model bias and decreasing general coherence.

ArticFlow couples (i) a latent flow that transports noise to a shape-prior code and (ii) a point flow that transports points conditioned on the action and the shape prior, enabling a single model to represent diverse articulated categories and generalize across actions. On MuJoCo Menagerie, ArticFlow functions both as a generative model and as a neural simulator: it predicts action-conditioned kinematics from a compact prior and synthesizes novel morphologies via latent interpolation.

Text input consistently outperformed image input, while prompt language effects varied by model scale.\n  In reasoning enhancement experiments with GPT-5 series, increased reasoning intensity improved performance (from 82.6 to 100 points) but quadrupled token usage and drastically reduced efficiency, suggesting that models with minimal reasoning may be more practical. This research contributes: (1) implementation of a completely unexposed evaluation environment, (2) a real-exam-based LLM assessment framework, and (3) a practical evaluation perspective integrating performance, cost, and time considerations.

Reducing redundant visual tokens is critical to ease computational/memory burdens while preserving performance, enabling MLLM deployment in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive scenarios. Current visual token pruning methods mainly rely on attention-based redundancy analysis and are tailored to dense architectures. We propose Fast Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (FastMMoE), a training-free acceleration framework for mixture-of-experts (MoE) based MLLMs, developed from a routing analysis perspective. FastMMoE combines two complementary strategies: (i) expert activation reduction for visual tokens to minimize unnecessary expert computation; and (ii) routing-aware token pruning that leverages similarity in routing probability distributions to identify and remove highly redundant visual tokens. Experiments on large-scale MoE-MLLMs such as DeepSeek-VL2 and InternVL3.5 demonstrate that FastMMoE can reduce FLOPs by up to 55.0% while retaining approximately 95.5% of the original performance, consistently outperforming dense-model pruning baselines including FastV and SparseVLM across multiple retention rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "FastMMoE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408(MoE)\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u4e13\u5bb6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8def\u7531\u6982\u7387\u7684token\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u630195.5%\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1155%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9token\u5e8f\u5217\u8fc7\u957f\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u89c6\u89c9token\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97/\u5185\u5b58\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7fMLLM\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFastMMoE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7b56\u7565\uff1a(1)\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9token\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b(2)\u57fa\u4e8e\u8def\u7531\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u8def\u7531\u611f\u77e5token\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u79fb\u9664\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u89c6\u89c9token\u3002", "result": "\u5728DeepSeek-VL2\u548cInternVL3.5\u7b49\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MoE-MLLMs\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFastMMoE\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe55.0%\u7684FLOPs\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u7ea695.5%\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4fdd\u7559\u7387\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8eFastV\u548cSparseVLM\u7b49\u7a20\u5bc6\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "FastMMoE\u4e3aMoE-based MLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u52a0\u901f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8def\u7531\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89d2\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a20\u5bc6\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a powerful approach for building lightweight but competitive models, with strong evidence from both language and vision domains. However, its application to VLMs, particularly CLIP-style models, remains limited, often constrained to small-scale teachers and narrow evaluation tasks such as classification or retrieval. In this work, we present the first systematic study of distillation across a range of CLIP-style teacher models, ranging from standard baselines to large-scale state-of-the-art models. Contrary to trends observed in NLP and vision, we find that stronger teachers do not consistently yield better students; in fact, existing distillation frameworks often fail to scale, leading to degraded performance in downstream multimodal tasks such as visual question answering. Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions in KD and point toward new directions for designing parameter-efficient multimodal models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9CLIP\u98ce\u683c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5927\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728CLIP\u98ce\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u72ed\u7a84\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217CLIP\u98ce\u683c\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u84b8\u998f\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4ece\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u7ebf\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "result": "\u4e0eNLP\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Existing methods, such as DreamBooth, mitigate this issue through a class-specific prior-preservation loss, which requires increased computational cost during training and limits user control during inference time. To address these limitations, we propose Mask-Integrated Negative Attention Diffusion (MINDiff). MINDiff introduces a novel concept, negative attention, which suppresses the subject's influence in masked irrelevant regions. We achieve this by modifying the cross-attention mechanism during inference. This enables semantic control and improves text alignment by reducing subject dominance in irrelevant regions. Additionally, during the inference time, users can adjust a scale parameter lambda to balance subject fidelity and text alignment. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments on DreamBooth models demonstrate that MINDiff mitigates overfitting more effectively than class-specific prior-preservation loss. As our method operates entirely at inference time and does not alter the model architecture, it can be directly applied to existing DreamBooth models without re-training.

However, conventional Distribution Matching (DM) methods struggle to capture intrinsic cross-modal alignment. Subsequent studies have attempted to introduce cross-modal matching, but two major challenges remain: (i) independently and randomly initialized encoders lead to inconsistent modality mapping spaces, increasing training difficulty; and (ii) direct interactions between modalities tend to damage modality-specific (private) information, thereby degrading the quality of the distilled data. To address these challenges, we propose DAVDD, a pretraining-based decoupled audio-visual distillation framework. DAVDD leverages a diverse pretrained bank to obtain stable modality features and uses a lightweight decoupler bank to disentangle them into common and private representations. To effectively preserve cross-modal structure, we further introduce Common Intermodal Matching together with a Sample-Distribution Joint Alignment strategy, ensuring that shared representations are aligned both at the sample level and the global distribution level.

To bridge this gap, we present CUS-GS, a compact unified structured Gaussian Splatting representation, which connects multimodal semantic features with structured 3D geometry. Specifically, we design a voxelized anchor structure that constructs a spatial scaffold, while extracting multimodal semantic features from a set of foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, SEEM). Moreover, we introduce a multimodal latent feature allocation mechanism to unify appearance, geometry, and semantics across heterogeneous feature spaces, ensuring a consistent representation across multiple foundation models. Finally, we propose a feature-aware significance evaluation strategy to dynamically guide anchor growing and pruning, effectively removing redundant or invalid anchors while maintaining semantic integrity. Extensive experiments show that CUS-GS achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods using as few as 6M parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than the closest rival at 35M - highlighting the excellent trade off between performance and model efficiency of the proposed framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "CUS-GS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f53\u7d20\u5316\u951a\u70b9\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u63a5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u53163D\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5bfc\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f3D\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u800c\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f53\u7d20\u5316\u951a\u70b9\u7ed3\u6784\u6784\u5efa\u7a7a\u95f4\u652f\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u7edf\u4e00\u5916\u89c2\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u6307\u5bfc\u951a\u70b9\u751f\u957f\u548c\u4fee\u526a\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528600\u4e07\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6bd4\u6700\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\uff083500\u4e07\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "CUS-GS\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7d27\u51d1\u800c\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although existing works achieve impressive accomplishments in simultaneously harnessing image and text information, they lack the considerations of possible low-quality and missing modalities. In real-world applications, these issues might frequently occur, leading to urgent needs for models capable of predicting sentiment robustly. Therefore, we propose a Distribution-based feature Recovery and Fusion (DRF) method for robust multimodal sentiment analysis of image-text pairs. Specifically, we maintain a feature queue for each modality to approximate their feature distributions, through which we can simultaneously handle low-quality and missing modalities in a unified framework. For low-quality modalities, we reduce their contributions to the fusion by quantitatively estimating modality qualities based on the distributions. For missing modalities, we build inter-modal mapping relationships supervised by samples and distributions, thereby recovering the missing modalities from available ones.

However, existing research primarily focuses on balanced datasets and struggles to perform under real-world long-tailed distributions. In this work, we emphasize the critical role of soft labels in long-tailed dataset distillation and uncover the underlying mechanisms contributing to performance degradation. Specifically, we derive an imbalance-aware generalization bound for model trained on distilled dataset. We then identify two primary sources of soft-label bias, which originate from the distillation model and the distilled images, through systematic perturbation of the data imbalance levels. To address this, we propose ADSA, an Adaptive Soft-label Alignment module that calibrates the entangled biases. This lightweight module integrates seamlessly into existing distillation pipelines and consistently improves performance. On ImageNet-1k-LT with EDC and IPC=50, ADSA improves tail-class accuracy by up to 11.8% and raises overall accuracy to 41.4%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADSA provides a robust and generalizable solution under limited label budgets and across a range of distillation techniques.

We revisit 3DGS optimization from a machine learning perspective, framing novel view synthesis as a generalization problem to unseen viewpoints-an underexplored direction. We propose Frequency-Adaptive Sharpness Regularization (FASR), which reformulates the 3DGS training objective, thereby guiding 3DGS to converge toward a better generalization solution. Although Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) similarly reduces the sharpness of the loss landscape to improve generalization of classification models, directly employing it to 3DGS is suboptimal due to the discrepancy between the tasks. Specifically, it hinders reconstructing high-frequency details due to excessive regularization, while reducing its strength leads to under-penalizing sharpness. To address this, we reflect the local frequency of images to set the regularization weight and the neighborhood radius when estimating the local sharpness. It prevents floater artifacts in novel viewpoints and reconstructs fine details that SAM tends to oversmooth.

Graph-based RAG enhances structural reasoning by introducing explicit relational organization that enables information propagation across semantically connected text units. However, these methods typically rely on Euclidean embeddings that capture semantic similarity but lack a geometric notion of hierarchical depth, limiting their ability to represent abstraction relationships inherent in complex knowledge graphs. To capture both fine-grained semantics and global hierarchy, we propose HyperbolicRAG, a retrieval framework that integrates hyperbolic geometry into graph-based RAG. HyperbolicRAG introduces three key designs: (1) a depth-aware representation learner that embeds nodes within a shared Poincare manifold to align semantic similarity with hierarchical containment, (2) an unsupervised contrastive regularization that enforces geometric consistency across abstraction levels, and (3) a mutual-ranking fusion mechanism that jointly exploits retrieval signals from Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, emphasizing cross-space agreement during inference. Extensive experiments across multiple QA benchmarks demonstrate that HyperbolicRAG outperforms competitive baselines, including both standard RAG and graph-augmented baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "HyperbolicRAG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Poincare\u6d41\u5f62\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u8282\u70b9\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u83b7\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784RAG\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u6355\u83b7\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5c42\u6b21\u6df1\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u62bd\u8c61\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a1\uff09\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u5728Poincare\u6d41\u5f62\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u8282\u70b9\uff1b2\uff09\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u786e\u4fdd\u8de8\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u4e92\u6392\u540d\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHyperbolicRAG\u4f18\u4e8e\u5305\u62ec\u6807\u51c6RAG\u548c\u56fe\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u5185\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784RAG\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u83b7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

With large language models and reinforcement learning (RL), strategy-based training offers new opportunities to jointly model these aspects. However, multimodal reasoning is more complex than unimodal reasoning, requiring accurate feature representation and cross-modal verification while facing scarce, high-quality annotations, which makes direct application of RL sub-optimal. We identify two key limitations of supervised fine-tuning plus RL (SFT+RL) for multimodal FAS: (1) limited multimodal reasoning paths restrict the use of complementary modalities and shrink the exploration space after SFT, weakening the effect of RL; and (2) mismatched single-task supervision versus diverse reasoning paths causes reasoning confusion, where models may exploit shortcuts by mapping images directly to answers and ignoring the intended reasoning. To address this, we propose PA-FAS, which enhances reasoning paths by constructing high-quality extended reasoning sequences from limited annotations, enriching paths and relaxing exploration constraints. We further introduce an answer-shuffling mechanism during SFT to force comprehensive multimodal analysis instead of using superficial cues, thereby encouraging deeper reasoning and mitigating shortcut learning.

Recent Structured State-Space Models such as Mamba have demonstrated potential in TAD due to their long-range modeling capability and linear computational complexity. On the other hand, structured state-space models often face two key challenges in TAD, namely, decay of temporal context due to recursive processing and self-element conflict during global visual context modeling, which become more severe while handling long-span action instances. Additionally, traditional methods for TAD struggle with detecting long-span action instances due to a lack of global awareness and inefficient detection heads. This paper presents MambaTAD, a new state-space TAD model that introduces long-range modeling and global feature detection capabilities for accurate temporal action detection. MambaTAD comprises two novel designs that complement each other with superior TAD performance. First, it introduces a Diagonal-Masked Bidirectional State-Space (DMBSS) module which effectively facilitates global feature fusion and temporal action detection.

We present a rigorous, reproducible computational framework for applying neural topic modeling to focus group transcripts, addressing fundamental methodological challenges: hyperparameter sensitivity, model stability, and validation of interpretability. Using BERTopic applied to ten focus groups exploring HPV vaccine perceptions in Tunisia (1,076 utterances), we conducted systematic evaluation across 27 hyperparameter configurations, assessed stability through bootstrap resampling with 30 replicates per configuration, and validated interpretability through formal human evaluation by three domain experts. Our analysis demonstrates substantial sensitivity to hyperparameter choices and reveals that metric selection for stability assessment must align with analytical goals. A hierarchical merging strategy (extracting fine-grained topics for stability then consolidating for interpretability) effectively navigates the stability-coherence tradeoff, achieving coherence of 0.558 compared to 0.539 for direct extraction. Human validation confirmed topic quality with very good inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.79, weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.578).

Change detection tasks exist with different output granularities such as BCD, SCD, and BDA. However, existing methods require substantial expert knowledge to design specialized decoders that compensate for information loss during encoding across different tasks. This not only introduces uncertainty into the process of selecting optimal models for abrupt change scenarios (such as disaster outbreaks) but also limits the universality of these architectures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified, general change detection framework named UniRSCD. Building upon a state space model backbone, we introduce a frequency change prompt generator as a unified encoder. The encoder dynamically scans bitemporal global context information while integrating high-frequency details with low-frequency holistic information, thereby eliminating the need for specialized decoders for feature compensation. Subsequently, the unified decoder and prediction head establish a shared representation space through hierarchical feature interaction and task-adaptive output mapping. This integrating various tasks such as binary change detection and semantic change detection into a unified architecture, thereby accommodating the differing output granularity requirements of distinct change detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture can adapt to multiple change detection tasks and achieves leading performance on five datasets, including the binary change dataset LEVIR-CD, the semantic change dataset SECOND, and the building damage assessment dataset xBD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUniRSCD\u7edf\u4e00\u9065\u611f\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5c06BCD\u3001SCD\u3001BDA\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u51fa\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u7528\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6765\u8865\u507f\u7f16\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9891\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u626b\u63cf\u53cc\u65f6\u76f8\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u4f4e\u9891\u6574\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f93\u51fa\u6620\u5c04\u5efa\u7acb\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u53d8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6LEVIR-CD\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6SECOND\u548c\u5efa\u7b51\u635f\u4f24\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6xBD\u3002", "conclusion": "UniRSCD\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u51fa\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although this task has been extensively studied in English and other high-resource languages, Czech summarization, particularly in the context of historical documents, remains underexplored. This is largely due to the inherent linguistic complexity of Czech and the lack of high-quality annotated datasets.\n  In this work, we address this gap by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Mistral and mT5, which have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and multilingual settings. In addition, we also propose a translation-based approach that first translates Czech texts into English, summarizes them using an English-language model, and then translates the summaries back into Czech. Our study makes the following main contributions: We demonstrate that LLMs achieve new state-of-the-art results on the SumeCzech dataset, a benchmark for modern Czech text summarization, showing the effectiveness of multilingual LLMs even for morphologically rich, medium-resource languages like Czech.

Despite progress in deep learning, genetic programming, and, more recently, large language model (LLM)--based factor generation, existing approaches still explore only a narrow region of the vast alpha search space. Neural models tend to produce opaque and fragile patterns, while symbolic or formula-based methods often yield redundant or economically ungrounded expressions that generalize poorly. Although different in form, these paradigms share a key limitation: none can conduct broad, structured, and human-like exploration that balances logical consistency with creative leaps. To address this gap, we introduce the Cognitive Alpha Mining Framework (CogAlpha), which combines code-level alpha representation with LLM-driven reasoning and evolutionary search. Treating LLMs as adaptive cognitive agents, our framework iteratively refines, mutates, and recombines alpha candidates through multi-stage prompts and financial feedback. This synergistic design enables deeper thinking, richer structural diversity, and economically interpretable alpha discovery, while greatly expanding the effective search space. Experiments on A-share equities demonstrate that CogAlpha consistently discovers alphas with superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization over existing methods.

However, in dense traffic scenarios, frequent identity switching of targets hinders cross-view association and fusion. Meanwhile, multi-source information tends to generate redundant interactions during the encoding stage, and traditional vehicle-centric encoding leads to large amounts of repetitive historical trajectory feature encoding, degrading real-time inference performance. To address these challenges, we propose V2X-RECT, a trajectory prediction framework designed for high-density environments. It enhances data association consistency, reduces redundant interactions, and reuses historical information to enable more efficient and accurate prediction. Specifically, we design a multi-source identity matching and correction module that leverages multi-view spatiotemporal relationships to achieve stable and consistent target association, mitigating the adverse effects of mismatches on trajectory encoding and cross-view feature fusion. Then we introduce traffic signal-guided interaction module, encoding trend of traffic light changes as features and exploiting their role in constraining spatiotemporal passage rights to accurately filter key interacting vehicles, while capturing the dynamic impact of signal changes on interaction patterns. Furthermore, a local spatiotemporal coordinate encoding enables reusable features of historical trajectories and map, supporting parallel decoding and significantly improving inference efficiency.

Yet most existing filters focus narrowly on general safety and overlook cultural context. In this work, we introduce FanarGuard, a bilingual moderation filter that evaluates both safety and cultural alignment in Arabic and English. We construct a dataset of over 468K prompt and response pairs, drawn from synthetic and public datasets, scored by a panel of LLM judges on harmlessness and cultural awareness, and use it to train two filter variants. To rigorously evaluate cultural alignment, we further develop the first benchmark targeting Arabic cultural contexts, comprising over 1k norm-sensitive prompts with LLM-generated responses annotated by human raters. Results show that FanarGuard achieves stronger agreement with human annotations than inter-annotator reliability, while matching the performance of state-of-the-art filters on safety benchmarks.

Current solutions, such as rule-based sub-sampling, learned frame selector, or memory-based summarization, often introduce their own trade-offs: they compromise accuracy, necessitate additional training, or decrease inference speed. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Temporal Sampling (T3S), a training-free, plug-and-play inference wrapper that enables MLLMs to process long videos both efficiently and effectively. T3S exploits spatiotemporal redundancy by generating multiple short and diverse subsequences of video tokens at inference time, packing them within a single forward pass, and aggregating their predictions. This multi-subsequence formulation broadens visual coverage while reducing the computational cost of self-attention from $O(L^2)$ to $O(\\sum_{i=1}^m \u03b1_i^2L^2)$, where $\\sum_{i=1}^m \u03b1_i^2 < 1$. Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that T3S improves accuracy by up to 3.1% and reduces first token delay by $2.04\\times$, all with minimal integration effort. Our approach operates entirely at inference time, requires no model modifications or fine-tuning, and is compatible with a wide range of pretrained MLLMs. T3S turns video redundancy into a computational advantage, offering a scalable solution for long-video understanding.

However, their long chain-of-thought reasoning processes incur significant inference overhead. Pruning has emerged as a promising approach to reducing computational costs. However, existing efforts have primarily focused on large language models (LLMs), while pruning LRMs remains unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first empirical study on pruning LRMs and show that directly applying existing pruning techniques fails to yield satisfactory results. Our findings indicate that using self-generated reasoning data for calibration can substantially improve pruning performance. We further investigate how the difficulty and length of reasoning data affect pruning outcomes. Our analysis reveals that challenging and moderately long self-generated reasoning data serve as ideal calibration data. Based on these insights, we propose a Selective Self-Generated Reasoning (SSGR) data construction strategy to provide effective calibration data for pruning LRMs. Experimental results on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill model series validate that our strategy improves the reasoning ability of pruned LRMs by 10%-13% compared to general pruning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u7684\u526a\u679d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6821\u51c6\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u526a\u679d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\uff08SSGR\uff09\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u6602\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002\u526a\u679d\u662f\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\uff0cLRMs\u7684\u526a\u679d\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\uff08SSGR\uff09\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u5bf9\u526a\u679d\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4e14\u957f\u5ea6\u9002\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u662f\u6700\u4f73\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728DeepSeek-R1-Distill\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u901a\u7528\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u526a\u679d\u540eLRMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u4e8610%-13%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u662fLRMs\u526a\u679d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\uff0cSSGR\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u526a\u679d\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aLRMs\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are natural candidates, simply adding visual inputs yields surprisingly inconsistent gains on social tasks. Our quantitative analysis of cross-modal attention inside state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a core failure mode: in multi-speaker scenes, visual and textual tokens lack speaker-consistent alignment, exhibiting substantially weaker cross-modal attention than in object-centric images. To address this, we propose a multimodal multi-speaker attention alignment method that can be integrated into existing MLLMs. First, we introduce dynamic cross-modal head selection to identify attention heads most responsible for grounding. Then, an adaptive social-aware attention bias, computed from existing attention patterns and speaker locations, is injected into the attention mechanism. This bias reinforces alignment between a speaker's visual representation and their utterances without introducing trainable parameters or architectural changes. We integrate our method into three distinct MLLMs (LLaVA-NeXT-Video, Qwen2.5-VL, and InternVL3) and evaluate on three benchmarks (TVQA+, MMSI, OnlineMMSI). Across four social tasks, results demonstrate that our approach improves the ability of MLLMs and achieves state-of-the-art results. Attention visualizations confirm our method successfully focuses the model on speaker-relevant regions, enabling more robust multi-party social reasoning.

We replicate the core Bayesmark and HPOBench experiments under the original evaluation protocol, but replace GPT-3.5 with the open-weight Llama 3.1 70B model used for all text encoding components.\n  Our results broadly confirm the main claims of LLAMBO. Contextual warm starting via textual problem and hyperparameter descriptions substantially improves early regret behaviour and reduces variance across runs. LLAMBO's discriminative surrogate is weaker than GP or SMAC as a pure single task regressor, yet benefits from cross task semantic priors induced by the language model. Ablations that remove textual context markedly degrade predictive accuracy and calibration, while the LLAMBO candidate sampler consistently generates higher quality and more diverse proposals than TPE or random sampling. Experiments with smaller backbones (Gemma 27B, Llama 3.1 8B) yield unstable or invalid predictions, suggesting insufficient capacity for reliable surrogate behaviour.\n  Overall, our study shows that the LLAMBO architecture is robust to changing the language model backbone and remains effective when instantiated with Llama 3.1 70B.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u590d\u73b0\u4e86LLAMBO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u6e90\u7684Llama 3.1 70B\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u4ee3GPT-3.5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u65e9\u671f\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1LLAMBO\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u4ee3GPT-3.5\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u8ba4\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\u590d\u73b0\u6838\u5fc3\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Llama 3.1 70B\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u6362GPT-3.5\uff0c\u8fdb\u884cBayesmark\u548cHPOBench\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\uff08Gemma 27B\u3001Llama 3.1 8B\uff09\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "LLAMBO\u67b6\u6784\u5728Llama 3.1 70B\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u65e9\u671f\u9057\u61be\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5019\u9009\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLAMBO\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9aa8\u5e72\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Llama 3.1 70B\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8db3\u591f\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose a vision-encoder-centered generative pre-training pipeline and develop the VITAL-Series LMMs. (1) We adopt a machine-executed annotation-scrutiny paradigm, constructing over 4.5M vision-language (VL) pairs-the largest VQualA training dataset to date. (2) We employ a multi-task training workflow that simultaneously enhances the model's quantitative scoring precision and strengthens its capability for quality interpretation across both image and video modalities. (3) Building upon the vision encoder, we realize an efficient model zoo extension: the model zoo exhibits strong zero-shot performance, and each paired decoder requires only a swift warm-up using less than 1/1000 of the pre-training data to achieve performance comparable to the fully trained counterpart.

We introduce a benchmark evaluating both the necessity and effectiveness of web access across commercial models with no access to internal states or parameters. The dataset includes a static split of 783 temporally anchored questions answerable from pre-cutoff knowledge, aimed at testing whether models invoke search based on low internal confidence, and a dynamic split of 288 post-cutoff queries designed to test whether models recognise when search is required and retrieve updated information. Web access substantially improves static accuracy for GPT-5-mini and Claude Haiku 4.5, though confidence calibration worsens. On dynamic queries, both models frequently invoke search yet remain below 70 percent accuracy due to weak query formulation. Costs per accuracy-improving call remain low, but returns diminish once initial retrieval fails. Selective invocation helps, but models become overconfident and inconsistent after search. Overall, built-in web search meaningfully improves factual accuracy and can be invoked selectively, yet models remain overconfident, skip retrieval when it is essential, and falter once initial search queries underperform.

More modifications may be performed", "summary": "Large-scale vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have recently achieved remarkable performance in retrieval tasks, yet their potential for Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VVI-ReID) remains largely unexplored. The primary challenges are narrowing the modality gap and leveraging spatiotemporal information in video sequences. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel cross-modality feature learning framework named X-ReID for VVI-ReID. Specifically, we first propose a Cross-modality Prototype Collaboration (CPC) to align and integrate features from different modalities, guiding the network to reduce the modality discrepancy. Then, a Multi-granularity Information Interaction (MII) is designed, incorporating short-term interactions from adjacent frames, long-term cross-frame information fusion, and cross-modality feature alignment to enhance temporal modeling and further reduce modality gaps.

Existing methods mainly concentrate on the fusion of multi-modal features, yet neglecting the background interference. Besides, current multi-modal fusion methods often focus on aligning modality pairs but suffer from multi-modal consistency alignment. To address these issues, we propose a novel selective interaction and global-local alignment framework called Signal for multi-modal object ReID. Specifically, we first propose a Selective Interaction Module (SIM) to select important patch tokens with intra-modal and inter-modal information. These important patch tokens engage in the interaction with class tokens, thereby yielding more discriminative features. Then, we propose a Global Alignment Module (GAM) to simultaneously align multi-modal features by minimizing the volume of 3D polyhedra in the gramian space. Meanwhile, we propose a Local Alignment Module (LAM) to align local features in a shift-aware manner. With these modules, our proposed framework could extract more discriminative features for object ReID. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal object ReID benchmarks (i.e., RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) validate the effectiveness of our method.

However, existing RGBT trackers struggle to resolve modality discrepancies, which poses great challenges for robust feature representation. This limitation hinders effective cross-modal information propagation and fusion, which significantly reduces the tracking accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Contextual Aggregation with Deformable Alignment framework called CADTrack for RGBT Tracking. To be specific, we first deploy the Mamba-based Feature Interaction (MFI) that establishes efficient feature interaction via state space models. This interaction module can operate with linear complexity, reducing computational cost and improving feature discrimination. Then, we propose the Contextual Aggregation Module (CAM) that dynamically activates backbone layers through sparse gating based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). This module can encode complementary contextual information from cross-layer features. Finally, we propose the Deformable Alignment Module (DAM) to integrate deformable sampling and temporal propagation, mitigating spatial misalignment and localization drift.

In EFCIL, the plasticity-stability dilemma, learning new tasks versus catastrophic forgetting, is a significant challenge, primarily due to the unavailability of images from earlier tasks. In this paper, we introduce adversarial pseudo-replay (APR), a method that perturbs the images of the new task with adversarial attack, to synthesize the pseudo-replay images online without storing any replay samples. During the new task training, the adversarial attack is conducted on the new task images with augmented old class mean prototypes as targets, and the resulting images are used for knowledge distillation to prevent semantic drift. Moreover, we calibrate the covariance matrices to compensate for the semantic drift after each task, by learning a transfer matrix on the pseudo-replay samples.

We revisit the reconstruction behavior of diffusion models during denoising to unveil the underlying frequency energy mechanism governing this process. Building upon this observation, we propose FeRA, a frequency driven fine tuning framework that aligns parameter updates with the intrinsic frequency energy progression of diffusion. FeRA establishes a comprehensive frequency energy framework for effective diffusion adaptation fine tuning, comprising three synergistic components: (i) a compact frequency energy indicator that characterizes the latent bandwise energy distribution, (ii) a soft frequency router that adaptively fuses multiple frequency specific adapter experts, and (iii) a frequency energy consistency regularization that stabilizes diffusion optimization and ensures coherent adaptation across bands. Routing operates in both training and inference, with inference time routing dynamically determined by the latent frequency energy. It integrates seamlessly with adapter based tuning schemes and generalizes well across diffusion backbones and resolutions.

This limitation frequently leads to visual hallucinations and mis-alignments with user instructions, especially in scenarios involving complex scene understanding, human-object interactions, multi-stage actions, and in-context motion reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Plan-X, a framework that explicitly enforces high-level semantic planning to instruct video generation process. At its core lies a Semantic Planner, a learnable multimodal language model that reasons over the user's intent from both text prompts and visual context, and autoregressively generates a sequence of text-grounded spatio-temporal semantic tokens. These semantic tokens, complementary to high-level text prompt guidance, serve as structured \"semantic sketches\" over time for the video diffusion model, which has its strength at synthesizing high-fidelity visual details. Plan-X effectively integrates the strength of language models in multimodal in-context reasoning and planning, together with the strength of diffusion models in photorealistic video synthesis.

First, they operate as monolithic black boxes that provide undifferentiated reward signals, obscuring individual step contributions and hindering error diagnosis. Second, sequential decoding has O(n) time complexity. This makes real-time deployment impractical for complex reasoning tasks. We present DeCoRL (Decoupled Reasoning Chains via Coordinated Reinforcement Learning), a novel framework that transforms reasoning from sequential processing into collaborative modular orchestration. DeCoRL trains lightweight specialized models to generate reasoning sub-steps concurrently, eliminating sequential bottlenecks through parallel processing. To enable precise error attribution, the framework designs modular reward functions that score each sub-step independently. Cascaded DRPO optimization then coordinates these rewards while preserving inter-step dependencies.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), constrained by their local receptive fields, often struggle to capture complex global anatomical structures. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel hybrid architecture, HyM-UNet, designed to synergize the local feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the efficient global modeling capabilities of Mamba. Specifically, we design a Hierarchical Encoder that utilizes convolutional modules in the shallow stages to preserve high-frequency texture details, while introducing Visual Mamba modules in the deep stages to capture long-range semantic dependencies with linear complexity. To bridge the semantic gap between the encoder and the decoder, we propose a Mamba-Guided Fusion Skip Connection (MGF-Skip). This module leverages deep semantic features as gating signals to dynamically suppress background noise within shallow features, thereby enhancing the perception of ambiguous boundaries. We conduct extensive experiments on public benchmark dataset ISIC 2018. The results demonstrate that HyM-UNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice coefficient and IoU, while maintaining lower parameter counts and inference latency. This validates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in handling medical segmentation tasks characterized by complex shapes and scale variations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHyM-UNet\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CNN\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u548cMamba\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1", "motivation": "CNN\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5c42\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1a\u6d45\u5c42\u4f7f\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u6a21\u5757\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u9891\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u6df1\u5c42\u5f15\u5165Visual Mamba\u6a21\u5757\u6355\u83b7\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u63d0\u51faMamba\u5f15\u5bfc\u878d\u5408\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u95e8\u63a7\u4fe1\u53f7\u52a8\u6001\u6291\u5236\u6d45\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0", "result": "\u5728ISIC 2018\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cDice\u7cfb\u6570\u548cIoU\u6307\u6807\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf", "conclusion": "HyM-UNet\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5f62\u72b6\u590d\u6742\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027"}}

To address this challenge, a novel approach inspired by multi-stage image restoration is proposed, incorporating Point Spread Function (PSF) mechanisms to reveal the image degradation process while combining dynamic physical modeling with sequential feature fusion transfer, named SD-PSFNet. Specifically, SD-PSFNet employs a sequential restoration architecture with three cascaded stages, allowing multiple dynamic evaluations and refinements of the degradation process estimation. The network utilizes components with learned PSF mechanisms to dynamically simulate rain streak optics, enabling effective rain-background separation while progressively enhancing outputs through novel PSF components at each stage. Additionally, SD-PSFNet incorporates adaptive gated fusion for optimal cross-stage feature integration, enabling sequential refinement from coarse rain removal to fine detail restoration. Our model achieves state-of-the-art PSNR/SSIM metrics on Rain100H (33.12dB/0.9371), RealRain-1k-L (42.28dB/0.9872), and RealRain-1k-H (41.08dB/0.9838).

Prior work capitalizes on information theory to formalize these notions; however, these studies generally rely on two simplifications: (i) optimal listeners, and (ii) universal communicative need across languages. Here, we address these limitations by introducing an information-theoretic framework for discrete object naming systems, and we use it to prove that an optimal trade-off is achievable if and only if the listener's decoder is equivalent to the Bayesian decoder of the speaker. Adopting a referential game setup from emergent communication, and focusing on the semantic domain of kinship, we show that our notion of optimality is not only theoretically achievable but also emerges empirically in learned communication systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u547d\u540d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5f53\u542c\u8005\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u65f6\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a(i) \u5047\u8bbe\u6700\u4f18\u542c\u8005\uff0c(ii) \u5047\u8bbe\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u666e\u904d\u6c9f\u901a\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6d8c\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u6307\u79f0\u6e38\u620f\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4eb2\u5c5e\u5173\u7cfb\u8bed\u4e49\u57df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u79bb\u6563\u5bf9\u8c61\u547d\u540d\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e5f\u80fd\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u5730\u6d8c\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u547d\u540d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u662f\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u3002"}}

Leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs, our approach enables the model to produce emotional descriptions for each aspect category, thereby enriching sentiment representations with affective expressions. Furthermore, to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the generated emotions, we introduce an emotion refinement mechanism based on the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) dimensional framework. Specifically, emotions predicted by the LLM are projected onto a VAD space, and those inconsistent with their corresponding VAD coordinates are re-annotated using a structured LLM-based refinement strategy.

However, labeling these images is notably more costly and time-consuming than labeling other image types, as it requires labeling across various time points, where new lesions can be minor, and subtle changes are easily missed. Deep Active Learning (DAL) has shown promise in minimizing labeling costs by selectively querying the most informative samples, but existing studies have primarily focused on static tasks like classification and segmentation. Consequently, the conventional DAL approach cannot be directly applied to change detection tasks, which involve identifying subtle differences across multiple images. In this study, we propose a novel DAL framework, named Longitudinal Medical Imaging Active Learning (LMI-AL), tailored specifically for longitudinal medical imaging. By pairing and differencing all 2D slices from baseline and follow-up 3D images, LMI-AL iteratively selects the most informative pairs for labeling using DAL, training a deep learning model with minimal manual annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that, with less than 8% of the data labeled, LMI-AL can achieve performance comparable to models trained on fully labeled datasets.

While base LLMs, pre-trained on general text corpora, often struggle with reasoning due to a lack of specialized training, recent studies reveal their latent reason- ing potential tied to hidden states. However, existing hidden state manipulation methods, such as linear activation steering, suffer from limitations due to their rigid and unconstrained nature, often leading to distribution shifts and degraded text quality. In this work, we propose a novel approach for elic- iting CoT reasoning from base LLMs through hidden state manipulation grounded in probabilistic conditional generation. By reformulating the challenge as an optimization problem with a balanced likelihood and prior regularization framework, our method guides hidden states toward reasoning-oriented trajectories while preserving linguistic coherence. Extensive evaluations across mathematical, commonsense, and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach con- sistently outperforms existing steering methods, offering a theoretically principled and effective solution for enhancing reasoning capabilities in base LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u6fc0\u53d1\u57fa\u7840\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u8a00\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u7840\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u64cd\u7eb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u521a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6fc0\u53d1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6311\u6218\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u4f3c\u7136\u548c\u5148\u9a8c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6982\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5bfc\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u671d\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u5e38\u8bc6\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7840\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, their fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities in complex urban scenarios have not received significant attention in the fields of both research and industry. To fill this gap, we focus primarily on road markings as a typical example of fine-grained spatial elements under urban scenarios, given the essential role of the integrated road traffic network they form within cities. Around road markings and urban traffic systems, we propose RoadBench, a systematic benchmark that comprehensively evaluates MLLMs' fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities using BEV and FPV image inputs. This benchmark comprises six tasks consisting of 9,121 strictly manually verified test cases. These tasks form a systematic evaluation framework that bridges understanding at local spatial scopes to global reasoning. They not only test MLLMs' capabilities in recognition, joint understanding, and reasoning but also assess their ability to integrate image information with domain knowledge. After evaluating 14 mainstream MLLMs, we confirm that RoadBench is a challenging benchmark for MLLMs while revealing significant shortcomings in existing MLLMs' fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities within urban scenarios. In certain tasks, their performance even falls short of simple rule-based or random selection baselines.

However, it remains unclear how stably LLMs encode distinctions between true, false, and neither-true-nor-false content in their internal probabilistic representations. We introduce representational stability as the robustness of an LLM's veracity representations to perturbations in the operational definition of truth. We assess representational stability by (i) training a linear probe on an LLM's activations to separate true from not-true statements and (ii) measuring how its learned decision boundary shifts under controlled label changes. Using activations from sixteen open-source models and three factual domains, we compare two types of neither statements. The first are fact-like assertions about entities we believe to be absent from any training data. We call these unfamiliar neither statements. The second are nonfactual claims drawn from well-known fictional contexts. We call these familiar neither statements. The unfamiliar statements induce the largest boundary shifts, producing up to $40\\%$ flipped truth judgements in fragile domains (such as word definitions), while familiar fictional statements remain more coherently clustered and yield smaller changes ($\\leq 8.2\\%$). These results suggest that representational stability stems more from epistemic familiarity than from linguistic form. More broadly, our approach provides a diagnostic for auditing and training LLMs to preserve coherent truth assignments under semantic uncertainty, rather than optimizing for output accuracy alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u793a\u771f\u5047\u5185\u5bb9\u65f6\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u7684\u4e2d\u6027\u9648\u8ff0\u6700\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u719f\u6089\u865a\u6784\u5185\u5bb9\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u5728\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u6982\u7387\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u865a\u5047\u548c\u4e2d\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u771f\u503c\u5b9a\u4e49\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728LLM\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u6765\u5206\u79bb\u771f\u5047\u9648\u8ff0\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u6807\u7b7e\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e2d\u6027\u9648\u8ff0\uff1a\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u7684\u4e2d\u6027\u9648\u8ff0\u548c\u719f\u6089\u865a\u6784\u9648\u8ff0\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u7684\u4e2d\u6027\u9648\u8ff0\u5bfc\u81f4\u6700\u5927\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5728\u8106\u5f31\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u8bcd\u6c47\u5b9a\u4e49\uff09\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u8fbe40%\u7684\u771f\u503c\u5224\u65ad\u7ffb\u8f6c\uff0c\u800c\u719f\u6089\u865a\u6784\u9648\u8ff0\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u53d8\u5316\u8f83\u5c0f\uff08\u22648.2%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8868\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u591a\u6e90\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u719f\u6089\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3LLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u771f\u503c\u5206\u914d\u3002"}}

Despite recent progress, two critical challenges persist in this setting. First, existing semantic prototypes, even when enriched by LLMs, are static and limited, failing to capture the rich intra-class visual variations induced by different object states (e.g., a cat's pose). Second, the standard pseudo-box generation introduces a semantic mismatch between visual region proposals (which contain context) and object-centric text embeddings. To tackle these issues, we introduce two complementary prototype enhancement strategies. To capture intra-class variations in appearance and state, we propose the State-Enhanced Semantic Prototypes (SESP), which generates state-aware textual descriptions (e.g., \"a sleeping cat\") to capture diverse object appearances, yielding more discriminative prototypes. Building on this, we further introduce Scene-Augmented Pseudo Prototypes (SAPP) to address the semantic mismatch.

To explore this question, we evaluated the causal language model (phi-2) using a carefully curated corpus, with sentences that concluded plausibly or implausibly. Our analysis focused on the hidden states sampled at each model layer. To investigate how violations are encoded, we utilized two complementary probes. First, we conducted a per-layer detection using a linear probe. Our findings revealed that a simple linear decoder struggled to distinguish between plausible and implausible endings in the lowest third of the model's layers. However, its accuracy sharply increased in the middle blocks, reaching a peak just before the top layers. Second, we examined the effective dimensionality of the encoded violation. Initially, the violation widens the representational subspace, followed by a collapse after a mid-stack bottleneck. This might indicate an exploratory phase that transitions into rapid consolidation.

However, existing approaches mainly focus on directly enhancing the final resolution, often neglecting effective control over error propagation and accumulation during intermediate stages. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising approach that can represent the entire reconstruction process as a state sequence with multiple nodes, allowing for intermediate intervention. Nonetheless, its fixed linear mapper is limited by a narrow receptive field and restricted flexibility, which hampers its effectiveness in fine-grained images. To address this, we created a nonlinear state predictive control model \\textbf{MambaX} that maps consecutive spectral bands into a latent state space and generalizes the SR task by dynamically learning the nonlinear state parameters of control equations. Compared to existing sequence models, MambaX 1) employs dynamic state predictive control learning to approximate the nonlinear differential coefficients of state-space models; 2) introduces a novel state cross-control paradigm for multimodal SR fusion; and 3) utilizes progressive transitional learning to mitigate heterogeneity caused by domain and modality shifts. Our evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of the dynamic spectrum-state representation model in both single-image SR and multimodal fusion-based SR tasks, highlighting its substantial potential to advance spectrally generalized modeling across arbitrary dimensions and modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MambaX\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u9636\u6bb5\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u63a7\u5236\u3002Mamba\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5c06\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u5668\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578bMambaX\uff0c\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u5149\u8c31\u5e26\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u6cdb\u5316\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\u52a8\u6001\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u4ea4\u53c9\u63a7\u5236\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u8fc7\u6e21\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\u52a8\u6001\u9891\u8c31\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "MambaX\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6cdb\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this work, we present the first unified, statistics-based imaging noise model that jointly describes the noise behavior of APS and EVS pixels. Our formulation explicitly incorporates photon shot noise, dark current noise, fixed-pattern noise, and quantization noise, and links EVS noise to illumination level and dark current. Based on this formulation, we further develop a calibration pipeline to estimate noise parameters from real data and offer a detailed analysis of both APS and EVS noise behaviors.

Tackling any of these factors in isolation leaves substantial quality on the table. We therefore take a data-model co-design view and introduce UltraFlux, a Flux-based DiT trained natively at 4K on MultiAspect-4K-1M, a 1M-image 4K corpus with controlled multi-AR coverage, bilingual captions, and rich VLM/IQA metadata for resolution- and AR-aware sampling. On the model side, UltraFlux couples (i) Resonance 2D RoPE with YaRN for training-window-, frequency-, and AR-aware positional encoding at 4K; (ii) a simple, non-adversarial VAE post-training scheme that improves 4K reconstruction fidelity; (iii) an SNR-Aware Huber Wavelet objective that rebalances gradients across timesteps and frequency bands; and (iv) a Stage-wise Aesthetic Curriculum Learning strategy that concentrates high-aesthetic supervision on high-noise steps governed by the model prior. Together, these components yield a stable, detail-preserving 4K DiT that generalizes across wide, square, and tall ARs. On the Aesthetic-Eval at 4096 benchmark and multi-AR 4K settings, UltraFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source baselines across fidelity, aesthetic, and alignment metrics, and-with a LLM prompt refiner-matches or surpasses the proprietary Seedream 4.0.", "AI": {"tldr": "UltraFlux\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eFlux\u7684\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e-\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u751f\u652f\u63014K\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u3001VAE\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57284K\u591a\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd4\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u57281K\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u539f\u751f4K\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65f6\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u3001VAE\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5355\u72ec\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u4e00\u56e0\u7d20\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u7406\u60f3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e-\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u6784\u5efaMultiAspect-4K-1M\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u9762\u7ed3\u5408Resonance 2D RoPE\u4e0eYaRN\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u975e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027VAE\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001SNR-Aware Huber\u5c0f\u6ce2\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7f8e\u5b66\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u57284096\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684Aesthetic-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u591a\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd44K\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cUltraFlux\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u7f8e\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u914d\u5408LLM\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u53ef\u5339\u654c\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578bSeedream 4.0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89e3\u51b34K\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0cUltraFlux\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u76844K\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5bbd\u5c4f\u3001\u65b9\u5f62\u548c\u7ad6\u5c4f\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd4\u3002"}}

However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones. Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs. In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent. By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities. Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.

There are many ways to quantify discourse, one common way being to evaluate the informativeness of the discourse. That is, given the total number of words produced, how many of those are context-relevant and accurate. This type of analysis is called Correct Information Unit (CIU) analysis and is one of the most prevalent discourse analyses used by speech-language pathologists (SLPs). Despite this, CIU analysis in the clinic remains limited due to the manual labor needed by SLPs to code and analyze collected speech. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) seek to augment such labor by automating modeling of propositional, macrostructural, pragmatic, and multimodal dimensions of discourse. To that end, this study evaluated five ML models for reliable identification of Correct Information Units (CIUs, Nicholas & Brookshire, 1993), during a picture description task. The five supervised ML models were trained using randomly selected human-coded transcripts and accompanying words and CIUs from persons with aphasia. The baseline model training produced a high accuracy across transcripts for word vs non-word, with all models achieving near perfect performance (0.995) with high AUC range (0.914 min, 0.995 max).

However, collecting large-scale annotations is costly and time-consuming, while vast amounts of unlabeled imagery remain underutilized. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Semi-Supervised Active Learning (HSSAL) framework that integrates semi-supervised learning (SSL) and a novel hierarchical active learning (HAL) in a closed iterative loop. In each iteration, SSL refines the model using both labeled data through supervised learning and unlabeled data via weak-to-strong self-training, improving feature representation and uncertainty estimation. Guided by the refined representations and uncertainty cues of unlabeled samples, HAL then conducts sample querying through a progressive clustering strategy, selecting the most informative instances that jointly satisfy the criteria of scalability, diversity, and uncertainty. This hierarchical process ensures both efficiency and representativeness in sample selection. Extensive experiments on three benchmark RS scene classification datasets, including UCM, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45, demonstrate that HSSAL consistently outperforms SSL- or AL-only baselines. Remarkably, with only 8%, 4%, and 2% labeled training data on UCM, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45, respectively, HSSAL achieves over 95% of fully-supervised accuracy, highlighting its superior label efficiency through informativeness exploitation of unlabeled data.

We present insights from a preliminary benchmarking exercise with a chatbot for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) for an underserved community in India. We evaluated using HealthBench, a benchmark for conversational health models by OpenAI. We extracted 637 SRH queries from the dataset and evaluated on the 330 single-turn conversations. Responses were evaluated using HealthBench's rubric-based automated grader, which rated responses consistently low. However, qualitative analysis by trained annotators and public health experts revealed that many responses were actually culturally appropriate and medically accurate. We highlight recurring issues, particularly a Western bias, such as for legal framing and norms (e.g., breastfeeding in public), diet assumptions (e.g., fish safe to eat during pregnancy), and costs (e.g., insurance models).

However, evaluation methods lag behind: typical mean opinion score (MOS) estimators perform regression over entire utterances, while failures usually occur in a few problematic words. We observe that encoder-decoder ASR models (e.g., Whisper) surface word-level mismatches between speech and text via cross-attention, providing a fine-grained reward signal. Building on this, we introduce Word-level TTS Alignment by ASR-driven Attentive Reward (W3AR).

Unlike previous efficiency strategies that primarily emphasize vision-language correlations, ActDistill leverages action priors to guide knowledge transfer and model compression, achieving action-oriented efficiency for VLA models. Specifically, we employ a well-trained VLA model as the teacher and introduce a graph-structured encapsulation strategy to explicitly model the hierarchical evolution of action prediction. The student model, derived from the graph-encapsulated teacher, is further equipped with a dynamic router that adaptively selects computation paths based on action prediction demands, guided by hierarchical graph-informed supervision to ensure smooth and efficient evolution. During inference, graph-related auxiliary components are removed, allowing the student to execute only dynamically routed layers and predict high-precision actions with minimal computation and latency.

This study addresses whether complex neural networks are essential for the simple binary classification task of malaria. We introduce the Extracted Morphological Feature Engineered (EMFE) pipeline, a transparent, reproducible, and low compute machine learning approach tailored explicitly for simple cell morphology, designed to achieve deep learning performance levels on a simple CPU only setup with the practical aim of real world deployment.\n  Methods: The study used the NIH Malaria Cell Images dataset, with two features extracted from each cell image: the number of non background pixels and the number of holes within the cell. Logistic Regression and Random Forest were compared against ResNet18, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet across accuracy, model size, and CPU inference time. An ensemble model was created by combining Logistic Regression and Random Forests to achieve higher accuracy while retaining efficiency.\n  Results: The single variable Logistic Regression model achieved a test accuracy of 94.80 percent with a file size of 1.2 kB and negligible inference latency (2.3 ms). The two stage ensemble improved accuracy to 97.15 percent. In contrast, the deep learning methods require 13.6 MB to 44.7 MB of storage and show significantly higher inference times (68 ms).\n  Conclusion: This study shows that a compact feature engineering approach can produce clinically meaningful classification performance while offering gains in transparency, reproducibility, speed, and deployment feasibility.

This overemphasis on alignment leads to representation collapse and reduced diversity. In this work, we revisit multi-modal survival analysis via the dual lens of alignment and distinctiveness, positing that preserving modality-specific structure is as vital as achieving semantic coherence. In this paper, we introduce Together-Then-Apart (TTA), a unified min-max optimization framework that simultaneously models shared and modality-specific representations. The Together stage minimizes semantic discrepancies by aligning embeddings via shared prototypes, guided by an unbalanced optimal transport objective that adaptively highlights informative tokens. The Apart stage maximizes representational diversity through modality anchors and a contrastive regularizer that preserve unique modality information and prevent feature collapse. Extensive experiments on five TCGA benchmarks show that TTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Traditional coordination mechanisms, such as centralized oversight or adversarial adjudication, struggle to scale and often obscure how decisions emerge. We introduce a market-making framework for multi-agent large language model (LLM) coordination that organizes agent interactions as structured economic exchanges. In this setup, each agent acts as a market participant, updating and trading probabilistic beliefs, to converge toward shared, truthful outcomes. By aligning local incentives with collective epistemic goals, the framework promotes self-organizing, verifiable reasoning without requiring external enforcement. Empirically, we evaluate this approach across factual reasoning, ethical judgment, and commonsense inference tasks. Market-based coordination yields accuracy gains of up to 10% over single-shot baselines while preserving interpretability and transparency of intermediate reasoning steps.

In practice, those outputs are usually recompressed for storage and transmission. Ignoring recompression is suboptimal as the downstream codec might add additional artifacts to restored images. However, jointly optimizing SR and recompression is challenging, as the codecs are not differentiable and vary in configuration. In this paper, we present Versatile Recompression-Aware Perceptual Super-Resolution (VRPSR), which makes existing perceptual SR aware of versatile compression. First, we formulate compression as conditional text-to-image generation and utilize a pre-trained diffusion model to build a generalizable codec simulator. Next, we propose a set of training techniques tailored for perceptual SR, including optimizing the simulator using perceptual targets and adopting slightly compressed images as the training target. Empirically, our VRPSR saves more than 10\\% bitrate based on Real-ESRGAN and S3Diff under H.264/H.265/H.266 compression.

A simple encoder network is proposed to project the weights of LLMs into discrete latent vectors, which are then represented using a compact codebook. A lightweight decoder network is employed to map the codebook's representative vectors back to the original weight space. This method allows for significant compression of the large weights in LLMs, consisting solely of a small decoder, a concise codebook, and an index.

Nonetheless, errors still often occur, and are more nuanced and local compared to the previous generation of T2V models. While current evaluation paradigms assess video models across diverse dimensions, they typically evaluate videos holistically without identifying when specific errors occur or describing their nature. We address this gap by introducing Spotlight, a novel task aimed at localizing and explaining video-generation errors. We generate 600 videos using 200 diverse textual prompts and three state-of-the-art video generators (Veo 3, Seedance, and LTX-2), and annotate over 1600 fine-grained errors across six types, including motion, physics, and prompt adherence. We observe that adherence and physics errors are predominant and persist across longer segments, whereas appearance-disappearance and body pose errors manifest in shorter segments. We then evaluate current VLMs on Spotlight and find that VLMs lag significantly behind humans in error identification and localization in videos. We propose inference-time strategies to probe the limits of current VLMs on our task, improving performance by nearly 2x.

Existing methods primarily focus on image-level forgery detection, leaving generic video-level forgery detection largely underexplored. To advance video forensics, we propose a consolidated multimodal detection algorithm, named MM-Det++, specifically designed for detecting diffusion-generated videos. Our approach consists of two innovative branches and a Unified Multimodal Learning (UML) module. Specifically, the Spatio-Temporal (ST) branch employs a novel Frame-Centric Vision Transformer (FC-ViT) to aggregate spatio-temporal information for detecting diffusion-generated videos, where the FC-tokens enable the capture of holistic forgery traces from each video frame. In parallel, the Multimodal (MM) branch adopts a learnable reasoning paradigm to acquire Multimodal Forgery Representation (MFR) by harnessing the powerful comprehension and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which discerns the forgery traces from a flexible semantic perspective. To integrate multimodal representations into a coherent space, a UML module is introduced to consolidate the generalization ability of MM-Det++. In addition, we also establish a large-scale and comprehensive Diffusion Video Forensics (DVF) dataset to advance research in video forgery detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MM-Det++ and highlight the effectiveness of unified multimodal forgery learning in detecting diffusion-generated videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MM-Det++\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4f2a\u9020\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u652f\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u652f\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u578bDVF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\u5f15\u53d1\u4fe1\u606f\u5b89\u5168\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u7ea7\u901a\u7528\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u652f\u4f7f\u7528\u5e27\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u805a\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u652f\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u53d6\u4f2a\u9020\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u578bDVF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86MM-Det++\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f2a\u9020\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MM-Det++\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u53d6\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). At the core of SCL is Soft Symbolic Control, an adaptive governance mechanism that applies symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference, preserving neural flexibility while restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability. These results address critical gaps in existing frameworks such as ReAct, AutoGPT, and memory-augmented approaches. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we situate SCL within the taxonomy of hybrid intelligence, differentiating it from prompt-centric and memory-only approaches; (2) we formally define Soft Symbolic Control and contrast it with neuro-symbolic AI; and (3) we derive three design principles for trustworthy agents: modular decomposition, adaptive symbolic governance, and transparent state management. We provide a complete open-source implementation demonstrating the R-CCAM loop architecture, alongside a live GPT-4o-powered travel planning agent. By connecting expert system principles with modern LLM capabilities, this work offers a practical and theoretically grounded path toward reliable, explainable, and governable AI agents.

Real-world deployment often requires models to adapt to diverse hardware and latency constraints, yet most approaches to dynamic computation focus on a single axis -- such as reducing the number of tokens. We present a novel capability: AdaPerceiver, the first transformer architecture with unified adaptivity across depth, width, and tokens within a single model. We propose an architecture that supports adaptivity along these axes. We couple this with an efficient joint training regime that ensures the model maintains performance across its various configurations. We evaluate AdaPerceiver on image classification, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation tasks. On image classification, AdaPerceiver expands the accuracy-throughput Pareto front. It achieves 85.4% accuracy while yielding 36% higher throughput than FlexiViT-L. On dense prediction, AdaPerceiver matches ViT-H/14 while having $\\sim$26x fewer encoder FLOPs (floating-point operations) on semantic segmentation and depth estimation.

As large language models increasingly enable the creation of sophisticated fake news, understanding human detection capabilities becomes crucial, particularly across different cultural contexts. We conducted a survey where 89 participants (56 South Africans, 33 from other nationalities) evaluated 10 true South African news articles and 10 AI-generated fake versions. Results reveal an asymmetric pattern: South Africans demonstrated superior performance in detecting true news about their country (40% deviation from ideal rating) compared to other participants (52%), but performed worse at identifying fake news (62% vs. 55%). This difference may reflect South Africans' higher overall trust in news sources. Our analysis further shows that South Africans relied more on content knowledge and contextual understanding when judging credibility, while participants from other countries emphasised formal linguistic features such as grammar and structure. Overall, the deviation from ideal rating was similar between groups (51% vs. 53%), suggesting that cultural familiarity appears to aid verification of authentic information but may also introduce bias when evaluating fabricated content.

Accepted to AAAI 2026", "summary": "Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) aims to identify and localize anomalous regions in images of unseen object classes. While recent methods based on vision-language models like CLIP show promise, their performance is constrained by existing prompt engineering strategies. Current approaches, whether relying on single fixed, learnable, or dense dynamic prompts, suffer from a representational bottleneck and are prone to overfitting on auxiliary data, failing to generalize to the complexity and diversity of unseen anomalies. To overcome these limitations, we propose $\\mathtt{PromptMoE}$. Our core insight is that robust ZSAD requires a compositional approach to prompt learning. Instead of learning monolithic prompts, $\\mathtt{PromptMoE}$ learns a pool of expert prompts, which serve as a basis set of composable semantic primitives, and a visually-guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically combine them for each instance. Our framework materializes this concept through a Visually-Guided Mixture of Prompt (VGMoP) that employs an image-gated sparse MoE to aggregate diverse normal and abnormal expert state prompts, generating semantically rich textual representations with strong generalization. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets in industrial and medical domains demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of $\\mathtt{PromptMoE}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PromptMoE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u793a\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u793a\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6837\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u5f02\u5e38", "method": "\u5b66\u4e60\u4e13\u5bb6\u63d0\u793a\u6c60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u52a8\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a", "result": "\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u548c\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u768415\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "PromptMoE\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b"}}

At the same time, there is a growing demand for low-latency inference on resource-constrained devices that achieves high performance. In particular, stream data inference is typically performed over a sliding temporal window, leading to highly redundant computations. The recent Continual Transformers have addressed this issue, but they can only be effectively used in shallow models, which limits their scope and generalization power. In this paper, we propose the Deep Continual Transformer (DeepCoT), a redundancy-free encoder-only model that can be applied over existing deep encoder architectures with minimal changes. In our experiments over audio, video, and text streams, we show that DeepCoTs retain comparative performance to their non-continual baselines while offering a linear computational cost for all Transformer layers, which reduces up to two orders of magnitude in the running time compared to previous efficient models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DeepCoT\uff08\u6df1\u5ea6\u6301\u7eedTransformer\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u6ed1\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6301\u7eedTransformer\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6d45\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86DeepCoT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6539\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6d41\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDeepCoT\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u975e\u6301\u7eed\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6240\u6709Transformer\u5c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepCoT\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

However, their generalization remains sub-optimal due to fixed model parameters trained on limited training data distributions. In contrast, optimization-based methods enable scene-specific adaptation but lack scalability and require costly per-scene optimization. In this paper, we propose MVS-TTA, an efficient test-time adaptation (TTA) framework that enhances the adaptability of learning-based MVS methods by bridging these two paradigms. Specifically, MVS-TTA employs a self-supervised, cross-view consistency loss as an auxiliary task to guide inference-time adaptation. We introduce a meta-auxiliary learning strategy to train the model to benefit from auxiliary-task-based updates explicitly. Our framework is model-agnostic and can be applied to a wide range of MVS methods with minimal architectural changes. Extensive experiments on standard datasets (DTU, BlendedMVS) and a challenging cross-dataset generalization setting demonstrate that MVS-TTA consistently improves performance, even when applied to state-of-the-art MVS models. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate optimization-based test-time adaptation into learning-based MVS using meta-learning.

However, existing LLM serving frameworks exhibit non-deterministic behavior: identical inputs can yield different outputs when system configurations (e.g., tensor parallel (TP) size, batch size) vary, even under greedy decoding. This arises from the non-associativity of floating-point arithmetic and inconsistent reduction orders across GPUs. While prior work has addressed batch-size-related nondeterminism through batch-invariant kernels, determinism across different TP sizes remains an open problem, particularly in RL settings, where the training engine typically uses Fully Sharded Data Parallel (i.e., TP = 1) while the rollout engine relies on multi-GPU TP to maximize the inference throughput, creating a natural mismatch between the two. This precision mismatch problem may lead to suboptimal performance or even collapse for RL training. We identify and analyze the root causes of TP-induced inconsistency and propose Tree-Based Invariant Kernels (TBIK), a set of TP-invariant matrix multiplication and reduction primitives that guarantee bit-wise identical results regardless of TP size. Our key insight is to align intra- and inter-GPU reduction orders through a unified hierarchical binary tree structure. We implement these kernels in Triton and integrate them into vLLM and FSDP. Experiments confirm zero probability divergence and bit-wise reproducibility for deterministic inference across different TP sizes. Also, we achieve bit-wise identical results between vLLM and FSDP in RL training pipelines with different parallel strategy.

Unlike humans who naturally bridge details and high-level concepts, models tend to treat these elements in isolation. Prevailing evaluation protocols often decouple low-level perception from high-level reasoning, overlooking their semantic and causal dependencies, which yields non-diagnostic results and obscures performance bottlenecks. We present VCU-Bridge, a framework that operationalizes a human-like hierarchy of visual connotation understanding: multi-level reasoning that advances from foundational perception through semantic bridging to abstract connotation, with an explicit evidence-to-inference trace from concrete cues to abstract conclusions. Building on this framework, we construct HVCU-Bench, a benchmark for hierarchical visual connotation understanding with explicit, level-wise diagnostics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate a consistent decline in performance as reasoning progresses to higher levels. We further develop a data generation pipeline for instruction tuning guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and show that strengthening low-level capabilities yields measurable gains at higher levels.

Such behavior undermines fairness and distorts the intended alignment between vision and language. Recent post-hoc approaches attempt to mitigate bias by replacing the most attribute-correlated embedding coordinates with neutral values. However, our systematic analysis reveals three critical failures of this coordinate-wise approach: feature entanglement, poor cross-dataset generalization, and incomplete bias removal. We find that bias is not localized to a few coordinates but is instead distributed across a few linear subspaces. To address these limitations, we propose $\\textbf{S}$ubspace $\\textbf{P}$rojection $\\textbf{D}$ebiasing ($\\textbf{SPD}$), a geometrically principled framework that identifies and removes the entire subspace of linearly decodable bias while reinserting a neutral mean component to preserve semantic fidelity.

To address this critical gap, we introduce a novel and comprehensive benchmark, the first of its kind, designed to catalyze progress in automated scientific visualization.

Furthermore, to establish a strong baseline on this new benchmark, we propose Paper2SysArch, an end-to-end system that leverages multi-agent collaboration to convert papers into structured, editable diagrams. To validate its performance on complex cases, the system was evaluated on a manually curated and more challenging subset of these papers, where it achieves a composite score of 69.0.

However, existing methods are ill-suited for these scenarios, as they typically require offline access to accumulated video sequences and cannot incorporate language guidance that conveys task intent. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SFHand, the first streaming framework for language-guided 3D hand forecasting. SFHand autoregressively predicts a comprehensive set of future 3D hand states, including hand type, 2D bounding box, 3D pose, and trajectory, from a continuous stream of video and language instructions. Our framework combines a streaming autoregressive architecture with an ROI-enhanced memory layer, capturing temporal context while focusing on salient hand-centric regions. To enable this research, we also introduce EgoHaFL, the first large-scale dataset featuring synchronized 3D hand poses and language instructions. We demonstrate that SFHand achieves new state-of-the-art results in 3D hand forecasting, outperforming prior work by a significant margin of up to 35.8%. Furthermore, we show the practical utility of our learned representations by transferring them to downstream embodied manipulation tasks, improving task success rates by up to 13.4% on multiple benchmarks.

We revisit this challenge through the lens of temporal modeling: if video can be regarded as a full temporal process, then image editing can be seen as a degenerate temporal process. This perspective allows us to transfer single-frame evolution priors from video pre-training, enabling a highly data-efficient fine-tuning regime. Empirically, our approach matches the performance of leading open-source baselines while using only about one percent of the supervision demanded by mainstream editing models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4ec5\u97001%\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e3b\u6d41\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684{\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u56fe\u50cf}\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u4e14\u7f16\u8f91\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u89c6\u4e3a\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8fc1\u79fb\u5355\u5e27\u6f14\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7cbe\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u6d41\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u7ea61%\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c31\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u9886\u5148\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5148\u9a8c\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

A central challenge is to compare two LMCs, for example to assess the accuracy of an abstraction or to quantify the effect of model perturbations. In this work, we study the recently introduced Cantor-Kantorovich (or CK) distance. In particular we show that the latter can be framed as a discounted sum of finite-horizon Total Variation distances, making it an instance of discounted linear distance, but arising from the natural Cantor topology. Building on the latter observation, we analyze the properties of the CK distance along three dimensions: computational complexity, continuity properties and approximation. More precisely, we show that the exact computation of the CK distance is #P-hard. We also provide an upper bound on the CK distance as a function of the approximation relation between the two LMCs, and show that a bounded CK distance implies a bounded error between probabilities of finite-horizon traces. Finally, we provide a computable approximation scheme, and show that the latter is also #P-hard.

This study investigates two key questions: (1) Can consistency constraints and SAM-based supervision be jointly integrated to better exploit complementary information and enhance the segmenter? and (2) beyond that, can the segmenter in turn guide SAM through reciprocal supervision, enabling mutual improvement? To answer these questions, we present SCALER, a unified collaborative framework toward LDCOS that jointly optimizes a mean-teacher segmenter and a learnable SAM. SCALER operates in two alternating phases. In \\textbf{Phase \\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral1}}, the segmenter is optimized under fixed SAM supervision using entropy-based image-level and uncertainty-based pixel-level weighting to select reliable pseudo-label regions and emphasize harder examples. In \\textbf{Phase \\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral2}}, SAM is updated via augmentation invariance and noise resistance losses, leveraging its inherent robustness to perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that SCALER yields consistent performance gains across eight semi- and weakly-supervised COS tasks.

While these systems democratize software creation through natural language requirements, they introduce significant security risks that remain largely unexplored. We identify two risky scenarios: Malicious User with Benign Agents (MU-BA) and Benign User with Malicious Agents (BU-MA). We introduce the Implicit Malicious Behavior Injection Attack (IMBIA), demonstrating how multi-agent systems can be manipulated to generate software with concealed malicious capabilities beneath seemingly benign applications, and propose Adv-IMBIA as a defense mechanism. Evaluations across ChatDev, MetaGPT, and AgentVerse frameworks reveal varying vulnerability patterns, with IMBIA achieving attack success rates of 93%, 45%, and 71% in MU-BA scenarios, and 71%, 84%, and 45% in BU-MA scenarios. Our defense mechanism reduced attack success rates significantly, particularly in the MU-BA scenario. Further analysis reveals that compromised agents in the coding and testing phases pose significantly greater security risks, while also identifying critical agents that require protection against malicious user exploitation.

Existing DUNs suffer from: (1) \\textbf{Degradation-specific dependency}, as their optimization frameworks are tied to a known degradation model, making them unsuitable for BIR tasks; and (2) \\textbf{Over-smoothing bias}, resulting from the direct feeding of gradient descent outputs, dominated by low-frequency content, into the proximal term, suppressing fine textures. To overcome these issues, we propose UnfoldLDM to integrate DUNs with latent diffusion model (LDM) for BIR. In each stage, UnfoldLDM employs a multi-granularity degradation-aware (MGDA) module as the gradient descent step. MGDA models BIR as an unknown degradation estimation problem and estimates both the holistic degradation matrix and its decomposed forms, enabling robust degradation removal. For the proximal step, we design a degradation-resistant LDM (DR-LDM) to extract compact degradation-invariant priors from the MGDA output. Guided by this prior, an over-smoothing correction transformer (OCFormer) explicitly recovers high-frequency components and enhances texture details. This unique combination ensures the final result is degradation-free and visually rich. Experiments show that our UnfoldLDM achieves a leading place on various BIR tasks and benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, our design is compatible with existing DUN-based methods, serving as a plug-and-play framework.

TTS systems usually depend on reference audio for timbre, offer only limited text-level attribute control, and rarely support dialogue generation. TTM systems are constrained by input conditioning requirements that depend on expert knowledge annotations. The high heterogeneity of these input control conditions makes them difficult to joint modeling with speech synthesis. Despite sharing common acoustic modeling characteristics, these two tasks have long been developed independently, leaving open the challenge of achieving unified modeling through natural language instructions. We introduce InstructAudio, a unified framework that enables instruction-based (natural language descriptions) control of acoustic attributes including timbre (gender, age), paralinguistic (emotion, style, accent), and musical (genre, instrument, rhythm, atmosphere). It supports expressive speech, music, and dialogue generation in English and Chinese. The model employs joint and single diffusion transformer layers with a standardized instruction-phoneme input format, trained on 50K hours of speech and 20K hours of music data, enabling multi-task learning and cross-modal alignment. Fig. 1 visualizes performance comparisons with mainstream TTS and TTM models, demonstrating that InstructAudio achieves optimal results on most metrics. To our best knowledge, InstructAudio represents the first instruction-controlled framework unifying speech and music generation.

While explainable AI has advanced significantly in standard computer vision tasks, interpretability in FSS remains virtually unexplored despite its critical importance for understanding model behavior and guiding support set selection in data-scarce scenarios. This paper introduces the first dedicated method for interpreting matching-based FSS models by leveraging their inherent structural properties. Our Affinity Explainer approach extracts attribution maps that highlight which pixels in support images contribute most to query segmentation predictions, using matching scores computed between support and query features at multiple feature levels. We extend standard interpretability evaluation metrics to the FSS domain and propose additional metrics to better capture the practical utility of explanations in few-shot scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on FSS benchmark datasets, using different models, demonstrate that our Affinity Explainer significantly outperforms adapted standard attribution methods.

However, existing DUN-based methods (RUN) inherently couple background estimation with image restoration, leading to conflicting objectives and requiring pre-defined degradation types, which are unrealistic in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose the nested unfolding network (NUN), a unified framework for real-world COS. NUN adopts a DUN-in-DUN design, embedding a degradation-resistant unfolding network (DeRUN) within each stage of a segmentation-oriented unfolding network (SODUN). This design decouples restoration from segmentation while allowing mutual refinement. Guided by a vision-language model (VLM), DeRUN dynamically infers degradation semantics and restores high-quality images without explicit priors, whereas SODUN performs reversible estimation to refine foreground and background. Leveraging the multi-stage nature of unfolding, NUN employs image-quality assessment to select the best DeRUN outputs for subsequent stages, naturally introducing a self-consistency loss that enhances robustness. Extensive experiments show that NUN achieves a leading place on both clean and degraded benchmarks.

Best-of-N (BoN) selects the output with the highest reward, and with perfect rewards, it often achieves near-perfect accuracy. With imperfect rewards from reward models, however, BoN fails to reliably find the correct answer and its performance degrades drastically. We consider the distribution of BoN's outputs and highlight that, although the correct answer does not usually have a probability close to one under imperfect rewards, it is often the most likely outcome. This suggests that the mode of this distribution can be more reliably correct than a sample from it. Based on this idea, we propose Majority-of-the-Bests (MoB), a novel selection mechanism that estimates the output distribution of BoN via bootstrapping and selects its mode. Experimental results across five benchmarks, three different base LLMs, and two reward models demonstrate consistent improvements over BoN in 25 out of 30 setups.

To achieve precise motion control, we introduce a novel pose representation that captures both global camera dynamics and articulated body movements, and integrate it through a dedicated control mechanism within the diffusion process.

Most models of this process posit that children learn early object labels from co-occurrences of words and their referents that occur when someone around them talks about an object in the immediate physical environment. But how aligned in time are children's visual and linguistic experiences during everyday learning? To date, answers to this question have been limited by the need for labor-intensive manual annotations of vision-language co-occurrences. Here, we evaluate the use of contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) models to automatically characterize vision-language alignment in egocentric videos taken from the infant perspective in home environments. After validating CLIP alignment scores using human alignment judgments, we apply this metric to a large corpus of infant-perspective videos. We show that idealized aligned moments for learning (e.g., \"look at the ball\" with a ball present in the child's view) are relatively rare in children's everyday experiences compared to modern machine learning datasets, and highlight variability in alignment both within and across children.

Frequency-domain spherical CNNs partially address this mismatch but require costly spherical harmonic transforms that constrain resolution and efficiency. We introduce the Unified Spherical Frontend (USF), a lens-agnostic framework that transforms images from any calibrated camera into a unit-sphere representation via ray-direction correspondences, and performs spherical resampling, convolution, and pooling directly in the spatial domain. USF is modular: projection, location sampling, interpolation, and resolution control are fully decoupled. Its distance-only spherical kernels offer configurable rotation-equivariance (mirroring translation-equivariance in planar CNNs) while avoiding harmonic transforms entirely. We compare standard planar backbones with their spherical counterparts across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks on synthetic (Spherical MNIST) and real-world datasets (PANDORA, Stanford 2D-3D-S), and stress-test robustness to extreme lens distortions, varying FoV, and arbitrary rotations.

A natural approach to better leverage high-quality data is curriculum-based pretraining, where the model is trained on data sorted in ascending order of quality as determined by a quality metric. However, prior studies have reported limited improvements from such curriculum-based pretraining strategies. This work identifies a critical factor constraining these methods: the incompatibility between the ascending data quality order and the decaying learning rate (LR) schedule. We find that while curriculum-based training substantially outperforms random shuffling when using a constant LR, its advantage diminishes under standard LR decay schedules. Our experiments show this incompatibility can be mitigated by two simple strategies: (1) employing a more moderate LR decay schedule, where the final LR is only moderately smaller than the peak LR, and (2) replacing LR decay with model averaging, i.e., computing a weighted average of the final few checkpoints. By combining these strategies, we improve the average score on a suite of standard benchmarks by 1.64% over random shuffling, without additional data refinement. Validated on 1.5B-parameter models trained over 30B tokens with various data-quality metrics, our findings call for a re-evaluation of curriculum-based LLM pretraining and underscore the potential of co-designing data curricula with optimization methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f0f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8870\u51cf\u8ba1\u5212\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0cLLM\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f0f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u6309\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5e94\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8870\u51cf\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a(1)\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u6e29\u548c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8870\u51cf\u8ba1\u5212\uff1b(2)\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u66ff\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8870\u51cf\u3002\u57281.5B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec330B tokens\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5f97\u5206\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u6d17\u724c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e861.64%\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u7cbe\u70bc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u547c\u5401\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f0fLLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, achieving an early diagnosis remains challenging, particularly in distinguishing subtle early signals of malignancy from those of benign conditions. In clinical practice, a patient with a high risk may need to undergo an initial baseline and several annual follow-up examinations (e.g., CT scans) before receiving a definitive diagnosis, which can result in missing the optimal treatment. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have been increasingly used for early diagnosis of lung cancer, but most existing algorithms focus on radiomic features extraction from single early-stage CT scans. Inspired by recent advances in diffusion models for image generation, this paper proposes a generative method, named CorrFlowNet, which creates a virtual, one-year follow-up CT scan after the initial baseline scan. This virtual follow-up would allow for an early detection of malignant/benign nodules, reducing the need to wait for clinical follow-ups. During training, our approach employs a correlational autoencoder to encode both early baseline and follow-up CT images into a latent space that captures the dynamics of nodule progression as well as the correlations between them, followed by a flow matching algorithm on the latent space with a neural ordinary differential equation. An auxiliary classifier is used to further enhance the diagnostic accuracy. Evaluations on a real clinical dataset show our method can significantly improve downstream lung nodule risk assessment compared with existing baseline models. Moreover, its diagnostic accuracy is comparable with real clinical CT follow-ups, highlighting its potential to improve cancer diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCorrFlowNet\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u865a\u62df\u4e00\u5e74\u968f\u8bbfCT\u626b\u63cf\u6765\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u80ba\u7ed3\u8282\u6076\u6027/\u826f\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7b49\u5f85\u4e34\u5e8a\u968f\u8bbf\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u80ba\u764c\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6b21\u65e9\u671fCT\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u800c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b21\u968f\u8bbf\u624d\u80fd\u786e\u8bca\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9519\u8fc7\u6700\u4f73\u6cbb\u7597\u65f6\u673a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u65e9\u671f\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u968f\u8bbfCT\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7ed3\u8282\u8fdb\u5c55\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8aCT\u968f\u8bbf\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "CorrFlowNet\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6539\u5584\u764c\u75c7\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u865a\u62df\u968f\u8bbf\u626b\u63cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u6076\u6027/\u826f\u6027\u7ed3\u8282\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Existing compression techniques like token eviction, quantization, or other low-rank methods often risk information loss, have fixed limits, or introduce significant computational overhead from explicit decompression steps. In this work, we introduce SWAN, a novel, fine-tuning-free framework that eliminates this overhead. Our method uses an offline orthogonal matrix to rotate and prune the KV-cache, which is then used directly in the attention computation without any reconstruction. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAN, augmented with a small dense buffer, offers a robust trade-off, maintaining performance close to the uncompressed baseline even at aggressive 50-60% memory savings per-token on KV-cache. A key advantage is its runtime-tunable compression level, allowing operators to dynamically adjust the memory footprint, a flexibility absent in methods requiring fixed offline configurations.

For continuous data, Gaussian models are often used and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is particularly suitable for estimating parameters from which clustering is inferred. If these models are particularly popular in various domains including image clustering, they however suffer from the dimensionality and also from the slowness of convergence of the EM algorithm. However, the Classification EM (CEM) algorithm, a classifying version, offers a fast convergence solution while dimensionality reduction still remains a challenge.

Existing benchmarks offer limited customizability over the scene complexity and are incapable of isolating and analyzing specific VLM failure modes under distinct spatial conditions. To address this gap, instead of individually presenting benchmarks for different scene complexities, in this paper we present InfiniBench, a fully automated, customizable and user-friendly benchmark generator that can synthesize a theoretically infinite variety of 3D scenes with parameterized control on scene complexity. InfiniBench uniquely translates scene descriptions in natural language into photo-realistic videos with complex and physically plausible 3D layouts. This is achieved through three key innovations: 1) a LLM-based agentic framework that iteratively refines procedural scene constraints from scene descriptions; 2) a flexible cluster-based layout optimizer that generates dense and cluttered scenes previously intractable for procedural methods; and 3) a task-aware camera trajectory optimization method that renders scenes into videos with full object coverage as VLM input. Experiments demonstrate that InfiniBench outperforms state-of-the-art procedural and LLM-based 3D generation methods in prompt fidelity and physical plausibility, especially in high-complexity scenarios.

To enhance LLM safety, various jailbreak defense methods have been proposed to guard against harmful outputs.

In this paper, we first analyze the causes of over-refusal from a representation perspective, revealing that over-refusal samples reside at the boundary between benign and malicious samples. Based on this, we propose MOSR, designed to mitigate over-refusal by intervening the safety representation of LLMs. MOSR incorporates two novel components: (1) Overlap-Aware Loss Weighting, which determines the erasure weight for malicious samples by quantifying their similarity to pseudo-malicious samples in the representation space, and (2) Context-Aware Augmentation, which supplements the necessary context for rejection decisions by adding harmful prefixes before rejection responses.

The supplemental material includes 23 pages with fourteen figures and four tables", "summary": "The success of in vitro fertilization (IVF) at many clinics relies on the accurate morphological assessment of day 5 blastocysts, a process that is often subjective and inconsistent. While artificial intelligence can help standardize this evaluation, models require large, diverse, and balanced datasets, which are often unavailable due to data scarcity, natural class imbalance, and privacy constraints. Existing generative embryo models can mitigate these issues but face several limitations, such as poor image quality, small training datasets, non-robust evaluation, and lack of clinically relevant image generation for effective data augmentation. Here, we present the Diffusion Based Imaging Model for Artificial Blastocysts (DIA) framework, a set of latent diffusion models trained to generate high-fidelity, novel day 5 blastocyst images. Our models provide granular control by conditioning on Gardner-based morphological categories and z-axis focal depth. We rigorously evaluated the models using FID, a memorization metric, an embryologist Turing test, and three downstream classification tasks. Our results show that DIA models generate realistic images that embryologists could not reliably distinguish from real images. Most importantly, we demonstrated clear clinical value. Augmenting an imbalanced dataset with synthetic images significantly improved classification accuracy (p < 0.05). Also, adding synthetic images to an already large, balanced dataset yielded statistically significant performance gains, and synthetic data could replace up to 40% of real data in some cases without a statistically significant loss in accuracy. DIA provides a robust solution for mitigating data scarcity and class imbalance in embryo datasets. By generating novel, high-fidelity, and controllable synthetic images, our models can improve the performance, fairness, and standardization of AI embryo assessment tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DIA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7b2c5\u5929\u56ca\u80da\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u80da\u80ce\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u80da\u80ce\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f53\u5916\u53d7\u7cbe(IVF)\u4e2d\u7b2c5\u5929\u56ca\u80da\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0cAI\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1DIA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u56ca\u80da\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u53ef\u57fa\u4e8eGardner\u5f62\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u548cz\u8f74\u7126\u8ddd\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "DIA\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u80da\u80ce\u5b66\u5bb6\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u5206\uff1b\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387(p<0.05)\uff1b\u5728\u5927\u578b\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e5f\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee340%\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "DIA\u4e3a\u80da\u80ce\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u9896\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347AI\u80da\u80ce\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The system aims to produce visually grounded, descriptive, and stylistically interesting text for fashion imagery, overcoming the limitations of end-to-end captioners that have problems with attribute fidelity and domain generalization. The pipeline combines a YOLO-based detector for multi-garment localization, k-means clustering for dominant color extraction, and a CLIP-FAISS retrieval module for fabric and gender attribute inference based on a structured product index. These attributes, together with retrieved style examples, create a factual evidence pack that is used to guide an LLM to generate human-like captions and contextually rich hashtags. A fine-tuned BLIP model is used as a supervised baseline model for comparison. Experimental results show that the YOLO detector is able to obtain a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.71 for nine categories of garments. The RAG-LLM pipeline generates expressive attribute-aligned captions and achieves mean attribute coverage of 0.80 with full coverage at the 50% threshold in hashtag generation, whereas BLIP gives higher lexical overlap and lower generalization.

While histopathology represents the gold standard, its invasiveness limits feasibility. Conventional supervised deep learning approaches are constrained by scarce biopsy-confirmed training data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) overcomes this by leveraging the growing availability of large-scale unlabeled brain metastases imaging datasets. Methods: In a two-phase deep learning strategy inspired by the foundation model paradigm, a Vision Transformer (ViT) was pre-trained via SSL on 10,167 unlabeled multi-source T1CE MRI sub-volumes. The pre-trained ViT was then fine-tuned for RN classification using a two-channel input (T1CE MRI and segmentation masks) on the public MOLAB dataset (n=109) using 20% of datasets as same-center held-out test set. External validation was performed on a second-center test cohort (n=28). Results: The self-supervised model achieved an AUC of 0.916 on the same-center test set and 0.764 on the second center test set, surpassing the fully supervised ViT (AUC 0.624/0.496; p=0.001/0.008) and radiomics (AUC 0.807/0.691; p=0.005/0.014). Multimodal integration further improved performance (AUC 0.947/0.821; p=0.073/0.001). Attention map visualizations enabled interpretability showing the model focused on clinically relevant lesion subregions. Conclusion: Large-scale pre-training on increasingly available unlabeled brain metastases datasets substantially improves AI model performance. A two-phase multimodal deep learning strategy achieved high accuracy in differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor progression using only routine T1CE MRI and standard clinical data, providing an interpretable, clinically accessible solution that warrants further validation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u8111\u8f6c\u79fb\u7624\u653e\u7597\u540e\u7684\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u574f\u6b7b\u4e0e\u80bf\u7624\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u6d3b\u68c0\u786e\u8ba4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8111\u8f6c\u79fb\u7624\u7acb\u4f53\u5b9a\u5411\u653e\u7597\u540e\u533a\u5206\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u574f\u6b7b\u4e0e\u80bf\u7624\u8fdb\u5c55\u662f\u4e34\u5e8a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6d3b\u68c0\u786e\u8ba4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u8111\u8f6c\u79fb\u7624\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u572810,167\u4e2a\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u591a\u6e90T1CE MRI\u5b50\u4f53\u79ef\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Vision Transformer\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728MOLAB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08n=109\uff09\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u8f93\u5165\uff08T1CE MRI\u548c\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0aAUC\u4e3a0.916\uff0c\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0aAUC\u4e3a0.764\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u76d1\u7763ViT\uff08AUC 0.624/0.496\uff09\u548c\u5f71\u50cf\u7ec4\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08AUC 0.807/0.691\uff09\u3002\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff08AUC 0.947/0.821\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u8111\u8f6c\u79fb\u7624\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5e38\u89c4T1CE MRI\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u533a\u5206\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u574f\u6b7b\u4e0e\u80bf\u7624\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u53ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Its main operation, SConvOp, lowers Linalg convolutions into tiled and packed generic operations through a fully declarative transformation pipeline. The process is guided by a Convolution Slicing Analysis that determines tile sizes and data layout strategies based on input and filter shapes, as well as target architecture parameters. SConvOp handles edge cases by splitting irregular regions and adjusting affine maps where needed. All packing and tiling operations are derived from a parametric set of affine equations, enabling reusable and analyzable transformations. Although functional correctness was the primary goal of this work, the experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of SConvTransform, achieving good enough performance across different target architectures. Future work will focus on optimizing performance and porting to other target devices.

Accelerated parallel MRI techniques reduce acquisition time by undersampling k-space data, but require robust reconstruction methods to recover high-quality images. Traditional approaches like SENSE require both undersampled k-space data and pre-computed coil sensitivity maps. We propose an end-to-end deep learning framework that jointly estimates coil sensitivity maps and reconstructs images from only undersampled k-space measurements at 4x acceleration. Our two-module architecture consists of a Coil Sensitivity Map (CSM) estimation module and a U-Net-based MRI reconstruction module. We evaluate our method on multi-coil brain MRI data from 10 subjects with 8 echoes each, using 2x SENSE reconstructions as ground truth. Our approach produces visually smoother reconstructions compared to conventional SENSE output, achieving comparable visual quality despite lower PSNR/SSIM metrics.

Unlike third-person (exocentric) videos that capture scenes from an outside observer, egocentric videos reflect the actor's continuously changing viewpoint, introducing partial observability, limited field of view, and self-referenced motion. We introduce $\\textbf{EgoVITA}$, a reinforcement learning framework that enables MLLMs to reason through structured planning and verification. Built on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EgoVITA alternates between two stages: (1) an $\\textbf{egocentric planning phase}$, where the model reasons from a first-person viewpoint to predict a step-by-step plan of future actions, and (2) an $\\textbf{exocentric verification phase}$, where it switches to a third-person perspective to check the visual and logical consistency of that plan. Through GRPO, the model learns to make plans that are causally predictive of upcoming visual observations, leading to more coherent and visually grounded reasoning. EgoVITA achieves significant gains on egocentric reasoning tasks, outperforming the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by $\\mathbf{+7.7}$ on EgoBlind and $\\mathbf{+4.4}$ on EgoOrient, while maintaining strong generalization on exocentric video tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "EgoVITA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u3001\u6709\u9650\u89c6\u91ce\u548c\u81ea\u53c2\u8003\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eGRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c4\u5212\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u52a8\u4f5c\u6b65\u9aa4\uff09\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u68c0\u67e5\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0cEgoBlind\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4Qwen2.5-VL-7B\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347+7.7\uff0cEgoOrient\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347+4.4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "EgoVITA\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MLLMs\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we introduce MapFormers, new architectures based on Transformer models, which can learn cognitive maps from observational data and perform path integration in parallel, in a self-supervised manner. Cognitive maps are learned in the model by disentangling structural relationships in the inputs from their specific content, a property that can be achieved naturally by updating the positional encoding in Transformers with input-dependent matrices. We developed two variants of MapFormers that unify absolute and relative positional encoding to model episodic (EM) and working memory (WM), respectively. We tested MapFormers on several tasks, including a classic 2D navigation task, showing that our models can learn a cognitive map of the underlying space and generalize OOD (e.g., to longer sequences) with near-perfect performance, unlike current architectures. Together, these results demonstrate the superiority of models designed to learn a cognitive map, and the importance of introducing a structural bias for structure-content disentanglement, which can be achieved in Transformers with input-dependent positional encoding.

Recent methods achieve centimeter-level accuracy on popular autonomous vehicle (AV) datasets, but are typically only trained and evaluated on a single sensor. In this paper, we aim to learn general motion priors that transfer to diverse and unseen LiDAR sensors. However, prior work in LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection demonstrate that naively training on multiple datasets yields worse performance than single dataset models. Interestingly, we find that this conventional wisdom does not hold for motion estimation, and that state-of-the-art scene flow methods greatly benefit from cross-dataset training. We posit that low-level tasks such as motion estimation may be less sensitive to sensor configuration; indeed, our analysis shows that models trained on fast-moving objects (e.g., from highway datasets) perform well on fast-moving objects, even across different datasets. Informed by our analysis, we propose UniFlow, a family of feedforward models that unifies and trains on multiple large-scale LiDAR scene flow datasets with diverse sensor placements and point cloud densities. Our frustratingly simple solution establishes a new state-of-the-art on Waymo and nuScenes, improving over prior work by 5.1% and 35.2% respectively.

In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands. These results highlight both the necessity and the current limitations of agent learning for scalable cross-environment generalization, and position AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 as a testbed for studying cross-environment agent learning.

In this context, the models observe continuously new training samples, and we aim to leverage this to improve their predictions. We thus propose an approach that continuously adapts a pre-trained diffusion model to a video stream. Since fine-tuning the parameters of a large diffusion model is too expensive, we refine the diffusion noise during inference while keeping the model parameters frozen, allowing the model to adaptively determine suitable sampling noise. We term the approach Sequence Adaptive Video Prediction with Diffusion Noise Optimization (SAVi-DNO). To validate our approach, we introduce a new evaluation setting on the Ego4D dataset, focusing on simultaneous adaptation and evaluation on long continuous videos.

However, such multi-step information-seeking tasks remain challenging for agents backed by language models. While process reward models (PRMs) can guide agents by ranking candidate steps at test-time, existing PRMs, designed for short reasoning with binary judgment, cannot capture richer dimensions of information-seeking steps, such as tool interactions and reasoning over tool outputs, nor handle the rapidly growing context in long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce PRInTS, a generative PRM trained with dual capabilities: (1) dense scoring based on the PRM's reasoning across multiple step quality dimensions (e.g., interpretation of tool outputs, tool call informativeness) and (2) trajectory summarization that compresses the growing context while preserving essential information for step evaluation. Extensive evaluations across FRAMES, GAIA (levels 1-3), and WebWalkerQA (easy-hard) benchmarks on multiple models, along with ablations, reveal that best-of-n sampling with PRInTS enhances information-seeking abilities of open-source models as well as specialized agents, matching or surpassing the performance of frontier models with a much smaller backbone agent and outperforming other strong reward modeling baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRInTS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6458\u8981\u6765\u63d0\u5347AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u957f\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fe1\u606f\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b(PRMs)\u662f\u4e3a\u77ed\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u8f93\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u957f\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPRInTS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u53cc\u91cd\u80fd\u529b\uff1a(1)\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b(2)\u8f68\u8ff9\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u589e\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6b65\u9aa4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728FRAMES\u3001GAIA\u548cWebWalkerQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528PRInTS\u7684\u6700\u4f73n\u91c7\u6837\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u641c\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PRInTS\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6458\u8981\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f7f\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

We present MammothModa2 (Mammoth2), a unified autoregressive-diffusion (AR-Diffusion) framework designed to effectively couple autoregressive semantic planning with diffusion-based generation. Mammoth2 adopts a serial design: an AR path equipped with generation experts performs global semantic modeling over discrete tokens, while a single-stream Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder handles high-fidelity image synthesis. A carefully designed AR-Diffusion feature alignment module combines multi-layer feature aggregation, unified condition encoding, and in-context conditioning to stably align AR's representations with the diffusion decoder's continuous latents. Mammoth2 is trained end-to-end with joint Next-Token Prediction and Flow Matching objectives, followed by supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning over both generation and editing. With roughly 60M supervised generation samples and no reliance on pre-trained generators, Mammoth2 delivers strong text-to-image and instruction-based editing performance on public benchmarks, achieving 0.87 on GenEval, 87.2 on DPGBench, and 4.06 on ImgEdit, while remaining competitive with understanding-only backbones (e.g., Qwen3-VL-8B) on multimodal understanding tasks.

This work systematically evaluates four intervention types, namely document translation, multilingual dense retrieval with pretrained encoders, contrastive learning at word, phrase, and query-document levels, and cross-encoder re-ranking, across three benchmark datasets. We find that dense retrieval models trained specifically for CLIR consistently outperform lexical matching methods and derive little benefit from document translation. Contrastive learning mitigates language biases and yields substantial improvements for encoders with weak initial alignment, and re-ranking can be effective, but depends on the quality of the cross-encoder training data. Although high-resource languages still dominate overall performance, gains over lexical and document-translated baselines are most pronounced for low-resource and cross-script pairs. These findings indicate that cross-lingual search systems should prioritise semantic multilingual embeddings and targeted learning-based alignment over translation-based pipelines, particularly for cross-script and under-resourced languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u56db\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u8bcd\u6c47\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u9762\u4e34\u8d44\u6e90\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u6587\u5b57\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u540c\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f31\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u5355\u8bed\u68c0\u7d22\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u7c7b\u578b\uff1a\u6587\u6863\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u5728\u8bcd/\u77ed\u8bed/\u67e5\u8be2-\u6587\u6863\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3aCLIR\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u8bcd\u6c47\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u6587\u6863\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\u751a\u5fae\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f31\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8de8\u6587\u5b57\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose SatSAM2, a zero-shot satellite video tracker built on SAM2, designed to adapt foundation models to the remote sensing domain. SatSAM2 introduces two core modules: a Kalman Filter-based Constrained Motion Module (KFCMM) to exploit temporal motion cues and suppress drift, and a Motion-Constrained State Machine (MCSM) to regulate tracking states based on motion dynamics and reliability. To support large-scale evaluation, we propose MatrixCity Video Object Tracking (MVOT), a synthetic benchmark containing 1,500+ sequences and 157K annotated frames with diverse viewpoints, illumination, and occlusion conditions. Extensive experiments on two satellite tracking benchmarks and MVOT show that SatSAM2 outperforms both traditional and foundation model-based trackers, including SAM2 and its variants.

Recently, multilingual large language models (mLLMs) have shifted query expansion from semantic augmentation with synonyms and related words to pseudo-document generation. Pseudo-documents both introduce additional relevant terms and bridge the gap between short queries and long documents, which is particularly beneficial in dense retrieval. This study evaluates recent mLLMs and fine-tuned variants across several generative expansion strategies to identify factors that drive cross-lingual retrieval performance. Results show that query length largely determines which prompting technique is effective, and that more elaborate prompts often do not yield further gains. Substantial linguistic disparities persist: cross-lingual query expansion can produce the largest improvements for languages with the weakest baselines, yet retrieval is especially poor between languages written in different scripts. Fine-tuning is found to lead to performance gains only when the training and test data are of similar format.

Existing evaluation protocols either emphasize compositional alignment or rely on single-round VQA-based scoring, leaving critical dimensions such as knowledge grounding, multi-physics interactions, and auditable evidence-substantially undertested. To address these limitations, we introduce PicWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark that assesses the grasp of implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning of T2I models. This benchmark consists of 1,100 prompts across three core categories. To facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we propose PW-Agent, an evidence-grounded multi-agent evaluator to hierarchically assess images on their physical realism and logical consistency by decomposing prompts into verifiable visual evidence.

We introduce a scalable spectral method that estimates the number of clusters directly from the structure of the Laplacian eigenspectrum, constructed using cosine similarities and guided by an adaptive sampling strategy. This sampling approach enables our estimator to efficiently scale to large datasets without sacrificing reliability. To support intrinsic evaluation of cluster quality without ground-truth labels, we propose the Cohesion Ratio, a simple and interpretable evaluation metric that quantifies how much intra-cluster similarity exceeds the global similarity background.

Extensive experiments on six short-text datasets and four modern embedding models show that standard algorithms like K-Means and HAC, when guided by our estimator, significantly outperform popular parameter-light methods such as HDBSCAN, OPTICS, and Leiden.

This work presents the first systematic evaluation of inference-time vision token masking as a privacy-preserving mechanism for medical document OCR using DeepSeek-OCR. We introduce seven masking strategies (V3-V9) targeting different architectural layers (SAM encoder blocks, compression layers, dual vision encoders, projector fusion) and evaluate PHI reduction across HIPAA-defined categories using 100 synthetic medical billing statements (drawn from a corpus of 38,517 annotated documents) with perfect ground-truth annotations. All masking strategies converge to 42.9% PHI reduction, successfully suppressing long-form spatially-distributed identifiers (patient names, dates of birth, physical addresses at 100% effectiveness) while failing to prevent short structured identifiers (medical record numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, account numbers at 0% effectiveness). Ablation studies varying mask expansion radius (r=1,2,3) demonstrate that increased spatial coverage does not improve reduction beyond this ceiling, indicating that language model contextual inference - not insufficient visual masking - drives structured identifier leakage. A simulated hybrid architecture combining vision masking with NLP post-processing achieves 88.6% total PHI reduction (assuming 80% NLP accuracy on remaining identifiers). This negative result establishes boundaries for vision-only privacy interventions in VLMs, provides guidance distinguishing PHI types amenable to vision-level versus language-level redaction, and redirects future research toward decoder-level fine-tuning and hybrid defense-in-depth architectures for HIPAA-compliant medical document processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u63a9\u7801\u5728\u533b\u7597\u6587\u6863OCR\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u53ea\u80fd\u51cf\u5c1142.9%\u7684PHI\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u7ed3\u5408NLP\u540e\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597OCR\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u5065\u5eb7\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528DeepSeek-OCR\uff0c\u5f15\u51657\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528100\u4efd\u5408\u6210\u533b\u7597\u8d26\u5355\u8bc4\u4f30PHI\u51cf\u5c11\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u90fd\u53ea\u80fd\u8fbe\u523042.9%\u7684PHI\u51cf\u5c11\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9\u957f\u683c\u5f0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u6709\u6548(100%)\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u77ed\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u65e0\u6548(0%)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u9690\u79c1\u5e72\u9884\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408NLP\u540e\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0HIPAA\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u533b\u7597\u6587\u6863\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

Distilled DMs are faster but typically remain confined within their teacher's domain. Thus, fast and high-quality generation for novel domains relies on two-stage training pipelines: Adapt-then-Distill or Distill-then-Adapt. However, both add design complexity and suffer from degraded quality or diversity. We introduce Uni-DAD, a single-stage pipeline that unifies distillation and adaptation of DMs. It couples two signals during training: (i) a dual-domain distribution-matching distillation objective that guides the student toward the distributions of the source teacher and a target teacher, and (ii) a multi-head generative adversarial network (GAN) loss that encourages target realism across multiple feature scales. The source domain distillation preserves diverse source knowledge, while the multi-head GAN stabilizes training and reduces overfitting, especially in few-shot regimes.

To bridge this gap, we introduce RoadSceneVQA, a large-scale and richly annotated visual question answering (VQA) dataset specifically tailored for roadside scenarios. The dataset comprises 34,736 diverse QA pairs collected under varying weather, illumination, and traffic conditions, targeting not only object attributes but also the intent, legality, and interaction patterns of traffic participants. RoadSceneVQA challenges models to perform both explicit recognition and implicit commonsense reasoning, grounded in real-world traffic rules and contextual dependencies. To fully exploit the reasoning potential of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we further propose CogniAnchor Fusion (CAF), a vision-language fusion module inspired by human-like scene anchoring mechanisms. Moreover, we propose the Assisted Decoupled Chain-of-Thought (AD-CoT) to enhance the reasoned thinking via CoT prompting and multi-task learning. Based on the above, we propose the baseline model RoadMind.

In this paper, we propose SwiftVGGT, a training-free method that significantly reduce inference time while preserving high-quality dense 3D reconstruction. To maintain global consistency in large-scale scenes, SwiftVGGT performs loop closure without relying on the external Visual Place Recognition (VPR) model. This removes redundant computation and enables accurate reconstruction over kilometer-scale environments. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective point sampling method to align neighboring chunks using a single Sim(3)-based Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) step. This eliminates the need for the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) optimization commonly used in prior work, leading to substantial speed-ups.

Existing fine-tuning methods using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with exact-match reward signals are often brittle, encourage memorization of training categories, and fail to elicit differential reasoning needed for generalization to unseen classes. To address this, we propose $\\textbf{DiVE-k}$, $\\textbf{Di}$fferential $\\textbf{V}$isual r$\\textbf{E}$asoning using top-$\\textbf{k}$ generations, framework that leverages model's own top-k predictions as a training signal. For each training image, DiVE-k creates a multiple-choice question from the model's top-k outputs and uses RL to train the model to select the correct answer. This approach requires the model to perform fine-grained differential reasoning among plausible options and provides a simple, verifiable reward signal that mitigates memorization and improves generalization.

While recent approaches involving GAN, transformer and diffusion-based models have made progress, they often struggle to capture the full spectrum of writer-specific attributes, particularly global stylistic patterns that span long-range spatial dependencies. As a result, capturing subtle writer-specific traits such as consistent slant, curvature or stroke pressure, while keeping the generated text accurate is still an open problem. In this work, we present a unified framework designed to address these limitations. We introduce a Vision Transformer-based style encoder that learns global stylistic patterns from multiple reference images, allowing the model to better represent long-range structural characteristics of handwriting. We then integrate these style cues with the target text using a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the system to produce handwritten images that more faithfully reflect the intended style. To make the process more interpretable, we utilize Salient Stroke Attention Analysis (SSAA), which reveals the stroke-level features the model focuses on during style transfer.

However, current stereo calibration methods lack intuitive optimal pose guidance, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal accuracy in deformation measurements. The aim of this study is to develop an interactive calibration framework that automatically generates the next optimal pose, enabling high-accuracy stereo calibration for 3D deformation measurement. We propose a pose optimization method that introduces joint optimization of relative and absolute extrinsic parameters, with the minimization of the covariance matrix trace adopted as the loss function to solve for the next optimal pose. Integrated with this method is a user-friendly graphical interface, which guides even non-expert users to capture qualified calibration images. Our proposed method demonstrates superior efficiency (requiring fewer images) and accuracy (demonstrating lower measurement errors) compared to random pose, while maintaining robustness across varying FOVs. In the thermal deformation measurement tests on an S-shaped specimen, the results exhibit high agreement with finite element analysis (FEA) simulations in both deformation magnitude and evolutionary trends. We present a pose guidance method for high-precision stereo calibration in 3D deformation measurement. The simulation experiments, real-world experiments, and thermal deformation measurement applications all demonstrate the significant application potential of our proposed method in the field of 3D deformation measurement.\n  Keywords: Stereo calibration, Optimal pose guidance, 3D deformation measurement, Digital image correlation", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e3D\u53d8\u5f62\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u7acb\u4f53\u6807\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u59ff\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u5bf9\u548c\u7edd\u5bf9\u5916\u53c2\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6700\u4f18\u6807\u5b9a\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6807\u5b9a\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7acb\u4f53\u6807\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u59ff\u6001\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53d8\u5f62\u6d4b\u91cf\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6700\u4f18\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6807\u5b9a\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u59ff\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u76f8\u5bf9\u548c\u7edd\u5bf9\u5916\u53c2\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u8ff9\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6c42\u89e3\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u4f18\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u754c\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\uff08\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5c11\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u66f4\u4f4e\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u573a\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u70ed\u53d8\u5f62\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u5143\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57283D\u53d8\u5f62\u6d4b\u91cf\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u70ed\u53d8\u5f62\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e94\u7528\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

In this study, we systematically evaluate three pretrained CNN architectures for brain tumor classification: RadImageNet DenseNet121 with medical-domain pretraining, EfficientNetV2S, and ConvNeXt-Tiny, which are modern general-purpose CNNs. All models were trained and fine-tuned under identical conditions using a limited-size brain MRI dataset to ensure a fair comparison. Our results reveal that ConvNeXt-Tiny achieved the highest accuracy, followed by EfficientNetV2S, while RadImageNet DenseNet121, despite being pretrained on domain-specific medical data, exhibited poor generalization with lower accuracy and higher loss. These findings suggest that domain-specific pretraining may not generalize well under small-data conditions. In contrast, modern, deeper general-purpose CNNs pretrained on large-scale datasets can offer superior transfer learning performance in specialized medical imaging tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CNN\u5728\u8111\u80bf\u7624MRI\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ConvNeXt-Tiny\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684RadImageNet DenseNet121\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5dee", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02", "method": "\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CNN\u67b6\u6784\uff1aRadImageNet DenseNet121\uff08\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u3001EfficientNetV2S\u548cConvNeXt-Tiny\uff08\u901a\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u8111MRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03", "result": "ConvNeXt-Tiny\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662fEfficientNetV2S\uff0c\u800cRadImageNet DenseNet121\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7ecf\u8fc7\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5dee\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u4e14\u635f\u5931\u8f83\u9ad8", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u901a\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CNN\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd"}}

Analyzing reading order and parent-child relations of posters is essential for building structure-aware interfaces that facilitate clear and accurate understanding of research content. Despite their prevalence in academic communication, posters remain underexplored in structural analysis research, which has primarily focused on papers. To address this gap, we constructed SciPostLayoutTree, a dataset of approximately 8,000 posters annotated with reading order and parent-child relations. Compared to an existing structural analysis dataset, SciPostLayoutTree contains more instances of spatially challenging relations, including upward, horizontal, and long-distance relations. As a solution to these challenges, we develop Layout Tree Decoder, which incorporates visual features as well as bounding box features including position and category information. The model also uses beam search to predict relations while capturing sequence-level plausibility. Experimental results demonstrate that our model improves the prediction accuracy for spatially challenging relations and establishes a solid baseline for poster structure analysis.

However, tracking UAVs using a single visual modality often fails in challenging scenarios, such as low illumination, cluttered backgrounds, and rapid motion. Although multi-modal multi-object UAV tracking is more resilient, the development of effective solutions has been hindered by the absence of dedicated public datasets. To bridge this gap, we release MM-UAV, the first large-scale benchmark for Multi-Modal UAV Tracking, integrating three key sensing modalities, e.g. RGB, infrared (IR), and event signals. The dataset spans over 30 challenging scenarios, with 1,321 synchronised multi-modal sequences, and more than 2.8 million annotated frames. Accompanying the dataset, we provide a novel multi-modal multi-UAV tracking framework, designed specifically for UAV tracking applications and serving as a baseline for future research. Our framework incorporates two key technical innovations, e.g. an offset-guided adaptive alignment module to resolve spatio mismatches across sensors, and an adaptive dynamic fusion module to balance complementary information conveyed by different modalities.

To address these issues, we introduce FlowPortal, a novel training-free flow-based video relighting framework. Our core innovation is a Residual-Corrected Flow mechanism that transforms a standard flow-based model into an editing model, guaranteeing perfect reconstruction when input conditions are identical and enabling faithful relighting when they differ, resulting in high structural consistency. This is further enhanced by a Decoupled Condition Design for precise lighting control and a High-Frequency Transfer mechanism for detail preservation.

To address this, we derive a maximum sampling frequency formulation for 4D Gaussian Splatting and introduce a 4D scale-adaptive filter and scale loss, which flexibly regulates the sampling frequency of 4D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach eliminates high-frequency artifacts under increased rendering frequencies while effectively reducing redundant Gaussians in multi-view video reconstruction. We validate the proposed method through monocular and multi-view video reconstruction experiments.Ours project page: https://4d-alias-free.github.io/4D-Alias-free/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd4D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u56e0\u76f8\u673a\u7126\u8ddd\u6216\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8c03\u6574\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8c03\u6574\u76f8\u673a\u7126\u8ddd\u6216\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u4e0e\u76f8\u673a\u8ddd\u79bb\u4ee5\u4fee\u6539\u6e32\u67d3\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u56e04D\u9ad8\u65af\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u548c2D\u81a8\u80c0\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e864D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u7684\u6700\u5927\u91c7\u6837\u9891\u7387\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e864D\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u82824D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u9891\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u6e32\u67d3\u9891\u7387\u65f6\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u9ad8\u9891\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u76ee\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u76844D\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

Existing methods are largely restricted to characters with similar structures and fail to generalize to category-free settings (e.g., transferring a humanoid's pose to a quadruped). The key challenge lies in the structural and transformation diversity inherent in distinct character types, which often leads to mismatched regions and poor transfer quality. To address these issues, we first construct a million-scale pose dataset across hundreds of distinct characters. We further propose MimiCAT, a cascade-transformer model designed for category-free 3D pose transfer. Instead of relying on strict one-to-one correspondence mappings, MimiCAT leverages semantic keypoint labels to learn a novel soft correspondence that enables flexible many-to-many matching across characters. The pose transfer is then formulated as a conditional generation process, in which the source transformations are first projected onto the target through soft correspondence matching and subsequently refined using shape-conditioned representations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that MimiCAT transfers plausible poses across different characters, significantly outperforming prior methods that are limited to narrow category transfer (e.g., humanoid-to-humanoid).", "AI": {"tldr": "MimiCAT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u51733D\u59ff\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u7ea7\u8054\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u5bf9\u5e94\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u5f62\u5230\u56db\u8db3\u52a8\u7269\uff09\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u95f4\u8fc1\u79fb\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u59ff\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u5173\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u5f62\u5230\u56db\u8db3\u52a8\u7269\uff09\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u53d8\u6362\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u533a\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u767e\u4e07\u7ea7\u8de8\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u63d0\u51faMimiCAT\u7ea7\u8054\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6f\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8de8\u89d2\u8272\u591a\u5bf9\u591a\u5339\u914d\uff1b\u5c06\u59ff\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u5bf9\u5e94\u5339\u914d\u5c06\u6e90\u53d8\u6362\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u5f62\u72b6\u6761\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMimiCAT\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\u95f4\u8fc1\u79fb\u5408\u7406\u7684\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u72ed\u7a84\u7c7b\u522b\u8fc1\u79fb\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u5f62\u5230\u4eba\u5f62\uff09\u7684\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MimiCAT\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u5bf9\u5e94\u5339\u914d\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u5173\u76843D\u59ff\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8de8\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

This task requires accurate rendering of complex scenes containing multiple objects that exhibit diverse attributes as well as intricate spatial and semantic relationships, demanding both precise object placement and coherent inter-object interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel compositional curriculum reinforcement learning framework named CompGen that addresses compositional weakness in existing T2I models. Specifically, we leverage scene graphs to establish a novel difficulty criterion for compositional ability and develop a corresponding adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo graph sampling algorithm. This difficulty-aware approach enables the synthesis of training curriculum data that progressively optimize T2I models through reinforcement learning.

However, its underlying mechanism in visual domains remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate Mamba's representational properties and make three primary contributions. First, we theoretically analyze Mamba's relationship to Softmax and Linear Attention, confirming that it can be viewed as a low-rank approximation of Softmax Attention and thereby bridging the representational gap between Softmax and Linear forms. Second, we introduce a novel binary segmentation metric for activation map evaluation, extending qualitative assessments to a quantitative measure that demonstrates Mamba's capacity to model long-range dependencies. Third, by leveraging DINO for self-supervised pretraining, we obtain clearer activation maps than those produced by standard supervised approaches, highlighting Mamba's potential for interpretability.

Traditional methods rely on visual modality, often struggling with complex threats. While recent studies incorporate language to guide single-view images, human inspectors typically use dual-view images in practice. This raises the question: can the second view provide constraints similar to a language modality? In this work, we introduce DualXrayBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for X-ray inspection that includes multiple views and modalities. It supports eight tasks designed to test cross-view reasoning. In DualXrayBench, we introduce a caption corpus consisting of 45,613 dual-view image pairs across 12 categories with corresponding captions. Building upon these data, we propose the Geometric (cross-view)-Semantic (cross-modality) Reasoner (GSR), a multimodal model that jointly learns correspondences between cross-view geometry and cross-modal semantics, treating the second-view images as a \"language-like modality\". To enable this, we construct the GSXray dataset, with structured Chain-of-Thought sequences: <top>, <side>, <conclusion>.

Current methods rely on human supervision but become impractical as model complexity increases. When models surpass human knowledge, providing accurate feedback becomes challenging and inefficient. A novel solution proposed recently is using a weaker model to supervise a stronger model. This concept leverages the ability of weaker models to perform evaluations, thereby reducing the workload on human supervisors. Previous work has shown the effectiveness of weak-to-strong generalization in the context of language-only models. Extending this concept to vision-language models leverages these insights, adapting the proven benefits to a multi-modal context. In our study, we explore weak-to-strong generalization for CLIP-based classification. We propose a method, class prototype learning (CPL), which aims to enhance the classification capabilities of the CLIP model, by learning more representative prototypes for each category. Our findings indicate that, despite using a simple loss function under weak supervision, CPL yields robust improvements in targeted scenarios, particularly when pretraining is limited.

The model was trained and validated on a curated dataset of T1CE scans from 137 brain tumor biopsy patients, annotated by a board-certified functional neurosurgeon. NeuroVascU-Net achieved a Dice score of 0.8609 and precision of 0.8841, accurately segmenting both major and fine vascular structures.

However, current methods that leverage 2D data often result in large, slow-to-train models, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy in resource-constrained environments. The architecture design of such models is therefore critical, determining their performance, memory footprint, and compute efficiency. The Joint-embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) has gained wide popularity in self-supervised learning for its simplicity and efficiency, but has been under-explored in cross-modal settings, partly due to the misconception that masking is intrinsic to JEPA. In this light, we propose CrossJEPA, a simple Cross-modal Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that harnesses the knowledge of an image foundation model and trains a predictor to infer embeddings of specific rendered 2D views from corresponding 3D point clouds, thereby introducing a JEPA-style pretraining strategy beyond masking. By conditioning the predictor on cross-domain projection information, CrossJEPA purifies the supervision signal from semantics exclusive to the target domain. We further exploit the frozen teacher design with a one-time target embedding caching mechanism, yielding amortized efficiency. CrossJEPA achieves a new state-of-the-art in linear probing on the synthetic ModelNet40 (94.2%) and the real-world ScanObjectNN (88.3%) benchmarks, using only 14.1M pretraining parameters (8.5M in the point encoder), and about 6 pretraining hours on a standard single GPU.

Incremental forgery detection aims to gradually update existing models with new forgery data, yet current sample replay-based methods are limited by low diversity and privacy concerns. Generative replay offers a potential solution by synthesizing past data, but its feasibility for forgery detection remains unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate generative replay and identify two scenarios: when the replay generator closely resembles the new forgery model, generated real samples blur the domain boundary, creating domain-risky samples; when the replay generator differs significantly, generated samples can be safely supervised, forming domain-safe samples. To exploit generative replay effectively, we propose a novel Domain-Aware Relative Weighting (DARW) strategy. DARW directly supervises domain-safe samples while applying a Relative Separation Loss to balance supervision and potential confusion for domain-risky samples. A Domain Confusion Score dynamically adjusts this tradeoff according to sample reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARW consistently improves incremental learning performance for forgery detection under different generative replay settings and alleviates the adverse impact of domain overlap.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u91cf\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u5bf9\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u56de\u653e\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u98ce\u9669\u6837\u672c\u548c\u9886\u57df\u5b89\u5168\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u76d1\u7763\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u56de\u653e\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4f4e\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u56de\u653e\u867d\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u5bf9\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u9886\u57df\u5b89\u5168\u6837\u672c\u76f4\u63a5\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5bf9\u9886\u57df\u98ce\u9669\u6837\u672c\u5e94\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u5206\u79bb\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u6df7\u6dc6\u5206\u6570\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u76d1\u7763\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u56de\u653e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u4e0d\u5229\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u56de\u653e\u5728\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u5bf9\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u56de\u653e\u63d0\u5347\u589e\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, vanilla RLVR for VLMs verifies only the final textual output, critically neglecting the foundational step of visual perception. This oversight leads to visual hallucinations and reward hacking, as reasoning built upon flawed perception is inherently unreliable. To address this, we propose PEARL (Perceptual-Evidence Anchored Reinforced Learning), a dual-branch, perception-reasoning synergistic that strengthens multimodal reasoning by explicitly anchoring it to verified visual evidence. For each reasoning-oriented QA instance, PEARL first derive a perception checklist -- a set of perception-oriented sub-questions with verifiable answers that probe the model's understanding of key visual evidence. During training, auxiliary rollouts on this checklist yield a perceptual reward that both directly reinforces the model's perception ability and acts as a fidelity gate for reasoning.

Existing upsampling approaches face a fundamental trade-off: classical filters are fast and broadly applicable but rely on fixed forms, while modern upsamplers achieve superior accuracy through learnable, VFM-specific forms at the cost of retraining for each VFM. We introduce Neighborhood Attention Filtering (NAF), which bridges this gap by learning adaptive spatial-and-content weights through Cross-Scale Neighborhood Attention and Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), guided solely by the high-resolution input image. NAF operates zero-shot: it upsamples features from any VFM without retraining, making it the first VFM-agnostic architecture to outperform VFM-specific upsamplers and achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks.

Nevertheless, existing Video Reasoning LLMs suffer from perception shortcuts, relying on a flawed single-step perception paradigm. This paradigm describes the video and then conducts reasoning, which runs the risk of insufficient evidence and emergent hallucinations. To address these issues, we introduce a new framework that integrates a loop-based paradigm with an anti-hallucination reward. First, to address the insufficient evidence, we introduce the Perception Loop Reasoning (PLR) paradigm. Instead of describing the video at once, each loop requires the model to describe a video segment with precise timestamps, analyze this segment, and decide the next action. Second, for the risk of hallucinations, the Factual-Aware Evaluator (FAE) evaluates each perception result as a reliable anti-hallucination reward. This reward encourages the model to provide sufficient and precise video evidence. Our FAE, which performs comparably to GPT-4o, is tuned on our AnetHallu-117K, a large-scale hallucination judgment preference dataset.

We address the challenge of egocentric 3D visual span forecasting, predicting where a person's visual perception will focus next within their three-dimensional environment. To this end, we propose EgoSpanLift, a novel method that transforms egocentric visual span forecasting from 2D image planes to 3D scenes. EgoSpanLift converts SLAM-derived keypoints into gaze-compatible geometry and extracts volumetric visual span regions. We further combine EgoSpanLift with 3D U-Net and unidirectional transformers, enabling spatio-temporal fusion to efficiently predict future visual span in the 3D grid. In addition, we curate a comprehensive benchmark from raw egocentric multisensory data, creating a testbed with 364.6K samples for 3D visual span forecasting.

A central challenge in this setting lies in balancing the contribution of the prior with the data fidelity term: overly aggressive likelihood updates may introduce artifacts, while conservative updates can slow convergence or yield suboptimal reconstructions. In this work, we propose an adaptive likelihood step-size strategy to guide the diffusion process for inverse-problem formulations. Specifically, we develop an observation-dependent weighting scheme based on the agreement between two different approximations of the intractable intermediate likelihood gradients, that adapts naturally to the diffusion schedule, time re-spacing, and injected stochasticity.

Current data-driven methods suffer from hallucination due to the lack of spectral diversity in existing hyperspectral image datasets, particularly when they are evaluated for the metamerism phenomenon. In this work, we formulate hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction as a Bayesian inference problem and propose a framework, HSDiff, that utilizes an unconditionally trained, pixel-level diffusion prior and posterior diffusion sampling to generate diverse HSI samples consistent with the measurements of various hyperspectral image formation models. We propose an enhanced metameric augmentation technique using region-based metameric black and partition-of-union spectral upsampling to expand training with physically valid metameric spectra, strengthening the prior diversity and improving uncertainty calibration. We utilize HSDiff to investigate how the studied forward models shape the posterior distribution and demonstrate that guiding with effective spectral encoding provides calibrated informative uncertainty compared to non-encoded models.

Existing DUNs are derived from full-HSI imaging models, where each stage operates directly on the high-dimensional HSI, refining the entire data cube based on the single 2D coded measurement. However, this paradigm leads to computational redundancy and suffers from the ill-posed nature of mapping 2D residuals back to 3D space of HSI. In this paper, we propose two novel imaging models corresponding to the spectral basis and subspace image by explicitly integrating low-rank (LR) decomposition with the sensing model. Compared to recovering the full HSI, estimating these compact low-dimensional components significantly mitigates the ill-posedness.

These are checked against various parameters such as power output, sinusoidal wave (I-V component of solar cell), voltage across each solar cell and others. Firstly, we filter and preprocess the obtained images using gamma removal and Gaussian filtering methods alongside some predefined processes like normalization. The first application is to detect whether a solar cell is dusty or not based on various pre-determined metrics like shadowing, leaf, droppings, air pollution and from other human activities to extent of fine-granular solar modules. The other one is detecting faults and other such occurrences on solar panels like faults, cracks, cell malfunction using thermal imaging application. This centralized platform can be vital since solar panels have different efficiency across different geography (air and heat affect) and can also be utilized for small-scale house requirements to large-scale solar farm sustentation effectively. It incorporates CNN, ResNet models that with self-attention mechanisms-KerNet model which are used for classification and results in a fine-tuned system that detects dust or any fault occurring.

In contrast, little attention has been paid to the training cost explosion that inevitably arises as the number of novel classes increases, a consequence of relying on gradient learning even under extreme data scarcity. More critically, since FSCIL typically provides only a few samples for each new class, gradient-based updates not only induce severe catastrophic forgetting on base classes but also hinder adaptation to novel ones. This paper seeks to break this long-standing limitation by asking: Can we design a training-free FSCIL paradigm that entirely removes gradient optimization? We provide an affirmative answer by uncovering an intriguing connection between gradient-based optimization and the Conditional Diffusion process. Building on this observation, we propose a Conditional Diffusion-driven FSCIL (CD-FSCIL) framework that substitutes the conventional gradient update process with a diffusion-based generative transition, enabling training-free incremental adaptation while effectively mitigating forgetting. Furthermore, to enhance representation under few-shot constraints, we introduce a multimodal learning strategy that integrates visual features with natural language descriptions automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). This synergy substantially alleviates the sample scarcity issue and improves generalization across novel classes. Extensive experiments on mainstream FSCIL benchmarks demonstrate that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also drastically reduces computational and memory overhead, marking a paradigm shift toward training-free continual adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FSCIL\uff09\u6846\u67b6CD-FSCIL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfFSCIL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u7206\u70b8\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6781\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9020\u6210\u57fa\u7840\u7c7b\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u8fd8\u963b\u788d\u65b0\u7c7b\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCD-FSCIL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u8f6c\u6362\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41FSCIL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5411\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4e3aFSCIL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Furthermore, recent works in fine-tuning diffusion models have shown promising results, but the fine-tuning tends to weaken the generative prior, limiting generalization to unseen cases. In this paper, we introduce the first zero-shot video deraining method for complex dynamic scenes that does not require synthetic data nor model fine-tuning, by leveraging a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model that demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. By inverting an input video into the latent space of diffusion models, its reconstruction process can be intervened and pushed away from the model's concept of rain using negative prompting. At the core of our approach is an attention switching mechanism that we found is crucial for maintaining dynamic backgrounds as well as structural consistency between the input and the derained video, mitigating artifacts introduced by naive negative prompting. Our approach is validated through extensive experiments on real-world rain datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods and showcasing robust generalization without the need for supervised training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u9891\u53bb\u96e8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5207\u6362\u673a\u5236\u53bb\u9664\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u96e8\u6ef4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u53bb\u96e8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6216\u9759\u6001\u76f8\u673a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u9891\u53cd\u8f6c\u5230\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u5e72\u9884\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53bb\u9664\u96e8\u6ef4\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5207\u6362\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u96e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u9891\u53bb\u96e8\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, they fail when the inputs are from vastly different viewpoints (e.g., aerial vs. ground) or modalities (e.g., photos vs. abstract drawings) compared to what was observed during training. This paper addresses a challenging version of this problem: predicting correspondences between ground-level photos and floor plans. Current datasets for joint photo--floor plan reasoning are limited, either lacking in varying modalities (VIGOR) or lacking in correspondences (WAFFLE). To address these limitations, we introduce a new dataset, C3, created by first reconstructing a number of scenes in 3D from Internet photo collections via structure-from-motion, then manually registering the reconstructions to floor plans gathered from the Internet, from which we can derive correspondence between images and floor plans. C3 contains 90K paired floor plans and photos across 597 scenes with 153M pixel-level correspondences and 85K camera poses. We find that state-of-the-art correspondence models struggle on this task. By training on our new data, we can improve on the best performing method by 34% in RMSE.

However, existing 3D reconstruction methods focus on geometry and appearance and cannot infer these underlying physical properties. We present PhysGS, a Bayesian-inferred extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting that estimates dense, per-point physical properties from visual cues and vision--language priors. We formulate property estimation as Bayesian inference over Gaussian splats, where material and property beliefs are iteratively refined as new observations arrive. PhysGS also models aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, enabling uncertainty-aware object and scene interpretation. Across object-scale (ABO-500), indoor, and outdoor real-world datasets, PhysGS improves accuracy of the mass estimation by up to 22.8%, reduces Shore hardness error by up to 61.2%, and lowers kinetic friction error by up to 18.1% compared to deterministic baselines.

Existing methods often rely on paired data or fail to model dynamic illumination and blur characteristics, leading to poor generalization. To tackle this, we propose a generative framework based on visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, guided by perceptual priors from the vision-language model (VLM). Specifically, to supply informative conditioning cues for VAR models, we deploy an adaptive curve estimation scheme to modulate the diverse illumination based on VLM-derived visibility scores. In addition, we integrate dynamic and spatial-frequency-aware Rotary Positional Encodings (SF-RoPE) into VAR to enhance its ability to model structures degraded by blur. Furthermore, we propose a recursive phase-domain modulation strategy that mitigates blur-induced artifacts in the phase domain via bounded iterative refinement guided by VLM-assessed blur scores.

We present the first stage-specific, cross-sectional benchmarking of deep learning models for follow-up MRI using the Burdenko GBM Progression cohort (n = 180). We analyze different post-RT scans independently to test whether architecture performance depends on time-point. Eleven representative DL families (CNNs, LSTMs, hybrids, transformers, and selective state-space models) were trained under a unified, QC-driven pipeline with patient-level cross-validation. Across both stages, accuracies were comparable (~0.70-0.74), but discrimination improved at the second follow-up, with F1 and AUC increasing for several models, indicating richer separability later in the care pathway. A Mamba+CNN hybrid consistently offered the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, while transformer variants delivered competitive AUCs at substantially higher computational cost and lightweight CNNs were efficient but less reliable. Performance also showed sensitivity to batch size, underscoring the need for standardized training protocols. Notably, absolute discrimination remained modest overall, reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of TP vs. PsP and the dataset's size imbalance.

However, the potential of jointly designing the asset representation and renderer remains largely unexplored. We argue that coupling them can unlock an end-to-end learnable graphics stack with benefits in fidelity, consistency, and efficiency. In this paper, we explore this possibility with NeAR: a Coupled Neural Asset-Renderer Stack. On the asset side, we build on Trellis-style Structured 3D Latents and introduce a lighting-homogenized neural asset: from a casually lit input, a rectified-flow backbone predicts a Lighting-Homogenized SLAT that encodes geometry and intrinsic material cues in a compact, view-agnostic latent. On the renderer side, we design a lighting-aware neural renderer that uses this neural asset, along with explicit view embeddings and HDR environment maps, to achieve real-time, relightable rendering. We validate NeAR on four tasks: (1) G-buffer-based forward rendering, (2) random-lit single-image reconstruction, (3) unknown-lit single-image relighting, and (4) novel-view relighting.

RAF deforms a static neutral facial mesh into industry-standard FACS poses to form an expressive blendshape rig. Deformations are predicted by a triangulation-agnostic surface learning network augmented with our tailored architecture design to condition on FACS parameters and efficiently process disconnected components. For training, we curated a dataset of facial meshes, with a subset meticulously rigged by professional artists to serve as accurate 3D ground truth for deformation supervision. Due to the high cost of manual rigging, this subset is limited in size, constraining the generalization ability of models trained exclusively on it. To address this, we design a 2D supervision strategy for unlabeled neutral meshes without rigs. This strategy increases data diversity and allows for scaled training, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of models trained on this augmented data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAF is able to rig meshes of diverse topologies on not only our artist-crafted assets but also in-the-wild samples, outperforming previous works in accuracy and generalizability. Moreover, our method advances beyond prior work by supporting multiple disconnected components, such as eyeballs, for more detailed expression animation.

In this study, we systematically evaluated a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier under multiple augmentation and enhancement strategies across several heterogeneous public datasets, as well as the AEyeDB dataset, a high-quality fundus dataset created in-house and made available for the research community. The ViT demonstrated consistently strong performance, with accuracies ranging from 0.789 to 0.843 across datasets and diseases. Diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration were detected reliably, whereas glaucoma remained the most frequently misclassified disease. Geometric and color augmentations provided the most stable improvements, while histogram equalization benefited datasets dominated by structural subtlety. Laplacian enhancement reduced performance across different settings.\n  On the Papila dataset, the ViT with geometric augmentation achieved an AUC of 0.91, outperforming previously reported convolutional ensemble baselines (AUC of 0.87), underscoring the advantages of transformer architectures and multi-dataset training. To complement the classifier, we developed a GANomaly-based anomaly detector, achieving an AUC of 0.76 while providing inherent reconstruction-based explainability and robust generalization to unseen data.

Neuroimaging, in particular, is underrepresented in the public domain due to identifiable facial features within MRI and CT scans, fundamentally restricting model performance in clinical medicine. Here, we show that frontier models underperform on neuroimaging tasks and that learning directly from uncurated data generated during routine clinical care at health systems, a paradigm we call health system learning, yields high-performance, generalist neuroimaging models. We introduce NeuroVFM, a visual foundation model trained on 5.24 million clinical MRI and CT volumes using a scalable volumetric joint-embedding predictive architecture. NeuroVFM learns comprehensive representations of brain anatomy and pathology, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple clinical tasks, including radiologic diagnosis and report generation. The model exhibits emergent neuroanatomic understanding and interpretable visual grounding of diagnostic findings. When paired with open-source language models through lightweight visual instruction tuning, NeuroVFM generates radiology reports that surpass frontier models in accuracy, clinical triage, and expert preference. Through clinically grounded visual understanding, NeuroVFM reduces hallucinated findings and critical errors, offering safer clinical decision support.

While existing data synthesis methods offer promising solutions, they often suffer from key limitations: manual modeling is labor intensive and requires expert knowledge. Deep generative models may be used to augment data and annotation, but they typically demand large amounts of training pairs in the first place, which is impractical in data limited clinical settings. In this work, we propose Tumor Fabrication (TF), a novel two-stage framework for unpaired 3D brain tumor synthesis. The framework comprises a coarse tumor synthesis process followed by a refinement process powered by a generative model. TF is fully automated and leverages only healthy image scans along with a limited amount of real annotated data to synthesize large volumes of paired synthetic data for enriching downstream supervised segmentation training.

Training such patches typically requires regularization that improves physical realizability (e.g., printability, smoothness) and/or robustness to real-world variability (e.g. deformations, viewing angle, noise). One type of variability that has received little attention is scale variability. When a patch is rescaled, either digitally through downsampling/upsampling or physically through changing imaging distances, interpolation-induced color mixing occurs. This smooths out pixel values, resulting in a loss of high-frequency patterns and degrading the adversarial signal. To address this, we present a novel superpixel-based regularization method that guides patch optimization to scale-resilient structures. Our ap proach employs the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm to dynamically cluster pixels in an adversarial patch during optimization. The Implicit Function Theorem is used to backpropagate gradients through SLIC to update the superpixel boundaries and color. This produces patches that maintain their structure over scale and are less susceptible to interpolation losses. Our method achieves greater performance in the digital domain, and when realized physically, these performance gains are preserved, leading to improved physical performance. Real-world performance was objectively assessed using a novel physical evaluation protocol that utilizes screens and cardboard cut-outs to systematically vary real-world conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SLIC\u7b97\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u4e2d\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9690\u51fd\u6570\u5b9a\u7406\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u66f4\u65b0\u8d85\u50cf\u7d20\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u989c\u8272\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ee4\u4eba\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f88\u5c11\u5173\u6ce8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5f53\u8865\u4e01\u88ab\u7f29\u653e\u65f6\uff0c\u63d2\u503c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u989c\u8272\u6df7\u5408\u4f1a\u5e73\u6ed1\u50cf\u7d20\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u9891\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u4fe1\u53f7\u9000\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SLIC\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u7c7b\u50cf\u7d20\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u9690\u51fd\u6570\u5b9a\u7406\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u66f4\u65b0\u8d85\u50cf\u7d20\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u989c\u8272\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5f53\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u5f97\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8d85\u50cf\u7d20\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u548c\u7269\u7406\u57df\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Diffusion-based NVS can generate high-quality, temporally consistent images, however, remains computationally prohibitive. Conversely, regression-based NVS offers suboptimal generation quality despite requiring significantly lower compute; leaving the design objective of a high-quality, inference-efficient NVS framework an open challenge. To close this critical gap, we present Sphinx, a training-free hybrid inference framework that achieves diffusion-level fidelity at a significantly lower compute. Sphinx proposes to use regression-based fast initialization to guide and reduce the denoising workload for the diffusion model.

This enables Sphinx to provide flexible navigation of the performance-quality trade-off, allowing adaptation to latency and fidelity requirements for dynamically changing inference scenarios.

Existing methods often rely on neural overfitting, where a coarse mesh is stored and progressively refined through multiple decoder networks. While this can restore high-quality surfaces, it is computationally expensive due to successive decoding passes and the irregular structure of mesh data. In contrast, images have a regular structure that enables powerful super-resolution and restoration frameworks, but applying these advantages to meshes is difficult because their irregular connectivity demands complex encoder-decoder architectures. Our key insight is that a geometry image-based representation transforms irregular meshes into a regular image grid, making efficient image-based neural processing directly applicable. Building on this idea, we introduce our neural geometry image-based representation, which is decoder-free, storage-efficient, and naturally suited for neural processing. It stores a low-resolution geometry-image mipmap of the surface, from which high-quality meshes are restored in a single forward pass. To construct geometry images, we leverage Optimal Transport (OT), which resolves oversampling in flat regions and undersampling in feature-rich regions, and enables continuous levels of detail (LoD) through geometry-image mipmapping. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art storage efficiency and restoration accuracy, measured by compression ratio (CR), Chamfer distance (CD), and Hausdorff distance (HD).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u7f51\u683c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u89c4\u5219\u56fe\u50cf\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u7f51\u683c\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u795e\u7ecf\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u800c\u56fe\u50cf\u5177\u6709\u89c4\u5219\u7ed3\u6784\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u3002\u5173\u952e\u6d1e\u5bdf\u662f\u5c06\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u7f51\u683c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u89c4\u5219\u56fe\u50cf\u7f51\u683c\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u5c06\u7f51\u683c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u89c4\u5219\u56fe\u50cf\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93(OT)\u89e3\u51b3\u5e73\u5766\u533a\u57df\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u533a\u57df\u6b20\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u50cfmipmapping\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u7ec6\u8282\u5c42\u6b21(LoD)\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4(CR)\u3001Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb(CD)\u548cHausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb(HD)\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u662f\u65e0\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u5929\u7136\u9002\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u4ece\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u50cfmipmap\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7f51\u683c\u3002"}}

Structured-light scanning with phase-shifting techniques is preferred for its use of low-intensity visible light and high accuracy, making it well suited for capturing 4D facial dynamics. A key step is phase unwrapping, which recovers continuous phase values from measurements wrapped modulo 2pi. The goal is to estimate the unwrapped phase count k in the equation Phi = phi + 2pi k, where phi is the wrapped phase and Phi is the true phase. Noise, occlusions, and complex 3D geometry make recovering the true phase challenging because phase unwrapping is ill-posed: measurements only provide modulo 2pi values, and estimating k requires assumptions about surface continuity. Existing methods trade speed for accuracy: fast approaches lack precision, while accurate algorithms are too slow for real-time use. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a phase unwrapping framework that reformulates GraphCut-based unwrapping as a pixel-labeling problem. This framework improves the estimation of the unwrapped phase count k through the invariance property of diffeomorphisms applied in image space via conformal and optimal transport (OT) maps. An odd number of diffeomorphisms are precomputed from the input phase data, and a hierarchical GraphCut algorithm is applied in each domain. The resulting label maps are fused via majority voting to robustly estimate k at each pixel.

We introduce Instant Concept Erasure (ICE), a training-free, modality-agnostic, one-shot weight modification approach that achieves precise, persistent unlearning with zero overhead. ICE defines erase and preserve subspaces using anisotropic energy-weighted scaling, then explicitly regularises against their intersection using a unique, closed-form overlap projector. We pose a convex and Lipschitz-bounded Spectral Unlearning Objective, balancing erasure fidelity and intersection preservation, that admits a stable and unique analytical solution. This solution defines a dissociation operator that is translated to the model's text-conditioning layers, making the edit permanent and runtime-free.

However, existing benchmarks often prioritize high-level planning or spatial reasoning, leaving the fine-grained action intelligence required for embodied physical interaction underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce CFG-Bench, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate this crucial capability. CFG-Bench consists of 1,368 curated videos paired with 19,562 three-modalities question-answer pairs targeting four cognitive abilities: 1) Physical Interaction, 2) Temporal-Causal Relation, 3) Intentional Understanding, and 4) Evaluative Judgment. Together, these dimensions provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to translate visual observations into actionable knowledge, moving beyond mere surface-level recognition. Our comprehensive evaluation on CFG-Bench reveals that leading MLLMs struggle to produce detailed instructions for physical interactions and exhibit profound limitations in the higher-order reasoning of intention and evaluation. Moreover, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our data demonstrates that teaching an MLLMs to articulate fine-grained actions directly translates to significant performance gains on established embodied benchmarks. Our analysis highlights these limitations and offers insights for developing more capable and grounded embodied agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "CFG-Bench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u52a8\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u542b1,368\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u548c19,562\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u56db\u79cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u9ad8\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\u6216\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5177\u8eab\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u52a8\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaCFG-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u610f\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u6d41MLLMs\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u6307\u4ee4\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5728\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u5728CFG-Bench\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u5177\u8eab\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CFG-Bench\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dMLLMs\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u548c\u63a5\u5730\u6c14\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

To mitigate this, we then develop two methods that incorporate the unique geometry of fisheye images into mainstream detection frameworks: one based on the bird's-eye-view (BEV) paradigm, named FisheyeBEVDet, and the other on the query-based paradigm, named FisheyePETR.

Existing works primarily focus on methods such as adjusting networks or training strategies to address noisy image recognition, and the anti-noise performance has reached a bottleneck. However, little is known about the exploration of anti-interference solutions from a neuronal perspective.This paper proposes an anti-noise neuronal convolution. This convolution mimics the dendritic structure of neurons, integrates the neighborhood interaction computation logic of dendrites into the underlying design of convolutional operations, and simulates the XOR logic preprocessing function of biological dendrites through nonlinear interactions between input features, thereby fundamentally reconstructing the mathematical paradigm of feature extraction. Unlike traditional convolution where noise directly interferes with feature extraction and exerts a significant impact, DDC mitigates the influence of noise by focusing on the interaction of neighborhood information. Experimental results demonstrate that in image classification tasks (using YOLOv11-cls, VGG16, and EfficientNet-B0) and object detection tasks (using YOLOv11, YOLOv8, and YOLOv5), after replacing traditional convolution with the dendritic convolution, the accuracy of the EfficientNet-B0 model on noisy datasets is relatively improved by 11.23%, and the mean Average Precision (mAP) of YOLOv8 is increased by 19.80%.

To address these issues, we introduce ObjectAlign, a novel framework that seamlessly blends perceptual metrics with symbolic reasoning to detect, verify, and correct object-level and temporal inconsistencies in edited video sequences. The novel contributions of ObjectAlign are as follows: First, we propose learnable thresholds for metrics characterizing object consistency (i.e. CLIP-based semantic similarity, LPIPS perceptual distance, histogram correlation, and SAM-derived object-mask IoU). Second, we introduce a neuro-symbolic verifier that combines two components: (a) a formal, SMT-based check that operates on masked object embeddings to provably guarantee that object identity does not drift, and (b) a temporal fidelity check that uses a probabilistic model checker to verify the video's formal representation against a temporal logic specification. A frame transition is subsequently deemed \"consistent\" based on a single logical assertion that requires satisfying both the learned metric thresholds and this unified neuro-symbolic constraint, ensuring both low-level stability and high-level temporal correctness. Finally, for each contiguous block of flagged frames, we propose a neural network based interpolation for adaptive frame repair, dynamically choosing the interpolation depth based on the number of frames to be corrected. This enables reconstruction of the corrupted frames from the last valid and next valid keyframes.

The multimodal nature of videos introduces unique challenges, necessitating the simultaneous consideration of both domain alignment and modality collaboration in a few-shot scenario, which is ignored in previous literature. We observe that, under the influence of domain shift, the generalization performance on the target domain of each individual modality, as well as that of fused multimodal features, is constrained. Because each modality is comprised of coupled features with multiple components that exhibit different domain shifts. This variability increases the complexity of domain adaptation, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multimodal feature integration. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework of Modality-Collaborative LowRank Decomposers (MC-LRD) to decompose modality-unique and modality-shared features with different domain shift levels from each modality that are more friendly for domain alignment. The MC-LRD comprises multiple decomposers for each modality and Multimodal Decomposition Routers (MDR). Each decomposer has progressively shared parameters across different modalities. The MDR is leveraged to selectively activate the decomposers to produce modality-unique and modality-shared features. To ensure efficient decomposition, we apply orthogonal decorrelation constraints separately to decomposers and subrouters, enhancing their diversity.

However, due to high annotation costs and diverse outdoor scenes, training data often fails to cover all possible test scenarios, known as the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue. Training-free image editing offers a promising solution for improving model robustness by training data enhancement without any modifications to pre-trained diffusion models. Nevertheless, inversion-based methods often suffer from limited effectiveness and inherent inaccuracies, while recent rectified-flow-based approaches struggle to preserve objects with accurate 3D geometry. In this paper, we propose DriveFlow, a Rectified Flow Adaptation method for training data enhancement in autonomous driving based on pre-trained Text-to-Image flow models. Based on frequency decomposition, DriveFlow introduces two strategies to adapt noise-free editing paths derived from text-conditioned velocities. 1) High-Frequency Foreground Preservation: DriveFlow incorporates a high-frequency alignment loss for foreground to maintain precise 3D object geometry. 2) Dual-Frequency Background Optimization: DriveFlow also conducts dual-frequency optimization for background, balancing editing flexibility and semantic consistency. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of DriveFlow, demonstrating comprehensive performance improvements on all categories across OOD scenarios.

This coarse supervision hinders the correction of localized artifacts and the modeling of fine-grained perceptual cues. We introduce Visual Preference Policy Optimization (ViPO), a GRPO variant that lifts scalar feedback into structured, pixel-level advantages. ViPO employs a Perceptual Structuring Module that uses pretrained vision backbones to construct spatially and temporally aware advantage maps, redistributing optimization pressure toward perceptually important regions while preserving the stability of standard GRPO. Across both image and video benchmarks, ViPO consistently outperforms vanilla GRPO, improving in-domain alignment with human-preference rewards and enhancing generalization on out-of-domain evaluations.

However, prevailing Imitative E2E Planners often suffer from multimodal trajectory mode collapse, failing to produce diverse trajectory proposals. Meanwhile, Generative E2E Planners struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization stage to refine their outputs. In this paper, we propose \\textit{\\textbf{GuideFlow}}, a novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely, \\textit{\\textbf{GuideFlow}} explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning signals. Our core contribution lies in directly enforcing explicit constraints within the flow matching generation process, rather than relying on implicit constraint encoding. Crucially, \\textit{\\textbf{GuideFlow}} unifies the training of the flow matching with the Energy-Based Model (EBM) to enhance the model's autonomous optimization capability to robustly satisfy physical constraints. Secondly, \\textit{\\textbf{GuideFlow}} parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style.

However, most existing methods rely on training a single diffusion model, which limits their ability to generate personalized and boundless city-scale scenes. In this paper, we present Yo'City, a novel agentic framework that enables user-customized and infinitely expandable 3D city generation by leveraging the reasoning and compositional capabilities of off-the-shelf large models. Specifically, Yo'City first conceptualize the city through a top-down planning strategy that defines a hierarchical \"City-District-Grid\" structure. The Global Planner determines the overall layout and potential functional districts, while the Local Designer further refines each district with detailed grid-level descriptions. Subsequently, the grid-level 3D generation is achieved through a \"produce-refine-evaluate\" isometric image synthesis loop, followed by image-to-3D generation. To simulate continuous city evolution, Yo'City further introduces a user-interactive, relationship-guided expansion mechanism, which performs scene graph-based distance- and semantics-aware layout optimization, ensuring spatially coherent city growth. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a diverse benchmark dataset and design six multi-dimensional metrics that assess generation quality from the perspectives of semantics, geometry, texture, and layout.

Beyond serving as a benchmark, FSU-QA also enables the assessment of world models by measuring the semantic coherence of their generated predictions, quantified through performance gains when VLMs are augmented with such outputs. Our experiments further demonstrate that FSU-QA can effectively enhance foresight reasoning: even small VLMs fine-tuned on FSU-QA surpass much larger, advanced models by a substantial margin.

The vast majority of samplers, however, rely on forward discretization of the reverse diffusion process and use score functions that are learned from data. Such forward and explicit discretizations can be slow and unstable, requiring a large number of sampling steps to produce good-quality samples. In this work we develop a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model based on backward discretizations, dubbed ProxT2I, relying on learned and conditional proximal operators instead of score functions. We further leverage recent advances in reinforcement learning and policy optimization to optimize our samplers for task-specific rewards. Additionally, we develop a new large-scale and open-source dataset comprising 15 million high-quality human images with fine-grained captions, called LAION-Face-T2I-15M, for training and evaluation.

Instead of sharing large feature maps or query embeddings, vehicles exchange compact reference points, e.g., objects' positions, velocities, and size information. This approach shifts the focus from \"what is seen\" to \"where to see\", creating a sensor- and model-independent interface that works well across vehicles with heterogeneous perception models while greatly reducing communication bandwidth. To enhance the richness of shared information, we further develop a selective Top-K query fusion that selectively adds high-confidence queries from the sender. It thus achieves a strong balance between accuracy and communication cost. Experiments on the M3CAD dataset show that RefPtsFusion maintains stable perception performance while reducing communication overhead by five orders of magnitude, dropping from hundreds of MB/s to only a few KB/s at 5 FPS (frame per second), compared to traditional feature-level fusion methods.

Unpaired enhancement pipelines are typically GAN-based, however, they can distort clinically critical vasculature, altering vessel topology and endpoint integrity. Motivated by these structural alterations, we propose Vessel-Aware Optimal Transport (\\textbf{VAOT}), a framework that combines an optimal-transport objective with two structure-preserving regularizers: (i) a skeleton-based loss to maintain global vascular connectivity and (ii) an endpoint-aware loss to stabilize local termini.

To acquire more realistic textures, generative methods are often used to extract Physically-based Rendering (PBR) textures and materials from large collections of wild images and project them back onto garment meshes. However, most image-conditioned texture generation approaches require strict topological consistency between the input image and the input 3D mesh, or rely on accurate mesh deformation to match to the image poses, which significantly constrains the texture generation quality and flexibility. To address the challenging problem of non-isometric image-based garment texture generation, we construct 3D Garment Videos, a physically simulated, garment-centric dataset that provides consistent geometry and material supervision across diverse deformations, enabling robust cross-pose texture learning. We further employ Nano Banana for high-quality non-isometric image editing, achieving reliable cross-topology texture generation between non-isometric image-geometry pairs. Finally, we propose an iterative baking method via uncertainty-guided view selection and reweighting that fuses multi-view predictions into seamless, production-ready PBR textures.

Existing methods, often designed for single-view inputs, treat multiple views as a disconnected set of images, leading to inconsistent feature representations and a high false-positive rate. To address this, we introduce ViewSense-AD (VSAD), a novel framework that learns viewpoint-invariant representations by explicitly modeling geometric consistency across views. At its core is our Multi-View Alignment Module (MVAM), which leverages homography to project and align corresponding feature regions between neighboring views. We integrate MVAM into a View-Align Latent Diffusion Model (VALDM), enabling progressive and multi-stage alignment during the denoising process. This allows the model to build a coherent and holistic understanding of the object's surface from coarse to fine scales. Furthermore, a lightweight Fusion Refiner Module (FRM) enhances the global consistency of the aligned features, suppressing noise and improving discriminative power. Anomaly detection is performed by comparing multi-level features from the diffusion model against a learned memory bank of normal prototypes.

While these systems offer enhanced controllability, they also introduce new safety risks, as harmful content can emerge from individual modalities or their interaction. Existing safety methods are often text-only, require prior knowledge of the risk category, or operate as post-generation auditors, struggling to proactively mitigate such compositional, multimodal risks. To address this challenge, we present ConceptGuard, a unified safeguard framework for proactively detecting and mitigating unsafe semantics in multimodal video generation. ConceptGuard operates in two stages: First, a contrastive detection module identifies latent safety risks by projecting fused image-text inputs into a structured concept space; Second, a semantic suppression mechanism steers the generative process away from unsafe concepts by intervening in the prompt's multimodal conditioning. To support the development and rigorous evaluation of this framework, we introduce two novel benchmarks: ConceptRisk, a large-scale dataset for training on multimodal risks, and T2VSafetyBench-TI2V, the first benchmark adapted from T2VSafetyBench for the Text-and-Image-to-Video (TI2V) safety setting. Comprehensive experiments on both benchmarks show that ConceptGuard consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in both risk detection and safe video generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "ConceptGuard\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6291\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u878d\u5408\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdc\u79bb\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4ec5\u6587\u672c\u7684\u3001\u9700\u8981\u9884\u5148\u4e86\u89e3\u98ce\u9669\u7c7b\u522b\u6216\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540e\u751f\u6210\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4e3b\u52a8\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u521b\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "ConceptGuard\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5bf9\u6bd4\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u878d\u5408\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff1b2\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u6291\u5236\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdc\u79bb\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cConceptGuard\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ConceptGuard\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3b\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we first develop a motion-aware VAE reconstruction method that performs segment-wise reconstruction, with each segment clip exhibiting uniform motion characteristic, thereby effectively handling videos with complex camera motions. Moreover, we observe that the first-frame latent extracted by the VAE encoder in each clip, termed the anchor-frame latent, remains unaffected by temporal compression and retains richer spatial structural information than subsequent frame latents. We further develop an anchor-frame guidance approach that leverages structural information from anchor frames to constrain the generation process and improve structural fidelity of video features.

To quantify these effects, we introduce Perfection Gap Factor (PGF), a metric that captures both the breadth and magnitude of transfer. Using three open-weight VLMs evaluated across 13 perception tasks, we construct a task-transfer graph that reveals previously unobserved relationships among perception tasks. Our analysis uncovers patterns of positive and negative transfer, identifies groups of tasks that mutually influence each other, organizes tasks into personas based on their transfer behavior and demonstrates how PGF can guide data selection for more efficient training. These findings highlight both opportunities for positive transfer and risks of negative interference, offering actionable guidance for advancing VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Perfection Gap Factor (PGF)\u6307\u6807\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u6b63\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u8ba1\u6570\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u52a1\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165PGF\u6307\u6807\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u5e7f\u5ea6\u548c\u5e45\u5ea6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6743\u91cdVLM\u572813\u4e2a\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u56fe\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6b63\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7ec4\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u8fc1\u79fb\u884c\u4e3a\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86PGF\u5982\u4f55\u6307\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u65e2\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u6b63\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4e5f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d1f\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdbVLM\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

The state-of-the-art stereo 3D detection method achieves twice the accuracy of monocular approaches, yet its inference speed is only half as fast. In this paper, we propose StereoDETR, an efficient stereo 3D object detection framework based on DETR. StereoDETR consists of two branches: a monocular DETR branch and a stereo branch. The DETR branch is built upon 2D DETR with additional channels for predicting object scale, orientation, and sampling points. The stereo branch leverages low-cost multi-scale disparity features to predict object-level depth maps. These two branches are coupled solely through a differentiable depth sampling strategy. To handle occlusion, we introduce a constrained supervision strategy for sampling points without requiring extra annotations.

Models trained in one setup fail to generalize to new environments, hardware, or users, a critical \"domain shift\" problem exacerbated by modest, fragmented public datasets. We shift from this limited paradigm and apply a foundation model approach, leveraging Masked Autoencoding (MAE) style pretraining on the largest and most heterogeneous Wi-Fi CSI datasets collection assembled to date. Our study pretrains and evaluates models on over 1.3 million samples extracted from 14 datasets, collected using 4 distinct devices across the 2.4/5/6 GHz bands and bandwidths from 20 to 160 MHz. Our large-scale evaluation is the first to systematically disentangle the impacts of data diversity versus model capacity on cross-domain performance. The results establish scaling trends on Wi-Fi CSI sensing. First, our experiments show log-linear improvements in unseen domain performance as the amount of pretraining data increases, suggesting that data scale and diversity are key to domain generalization. Second, based on the current data volume, larger model can only provide marginal gains for cross-domain performance, indicating that data, rather than model capacity, is the current bottleneck for Wi-Fi sensing generalization. Finally, we conduct a series of cross-domain evaluations on human activity recognition, human gesture recognition and user identification tasks. The results show that the large-scale pretraining improves cross-domain accuracy ranging from 2.2% to 15.7%, compared to the supervised learning baseline. Overall, our findings provide insightful direction for designing future Wi-Fi sensing systems that can eventually be robust enough for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MAE\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u572814\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001130\u4e07\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9Wi-Fi\u611f\u77e5\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u5bf9\u8de8\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Wi-Fi\u611f\u77e5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u56e0\u73af\u5883\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u3001\u7528\u6237\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(MAE)\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u572814\u4e2aWi-Fi CSI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f7f\u75284\u79cd\u8bbe\u5907\u3001\u591a\u4e2a\u9891\u6bb5(2.4/5/6 GHz)\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd(20-160 MHz)\u6536\u96c6\u7684130\u4e07\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff1a1) \u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u5e26\u6765\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff1b2) \u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0b\uff0c\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u8fb9\u9645\u6536\u76ca\uff1b3) \u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7528\u6237\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53472.2%-15.7%\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u662f\u5f53\u524dWi-Fi\u611f\u77e5\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u9c81\u68d2Wi-Fi\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Building on this capability, existing implicit 3D reconstruction methods have adapted the NeRF model and its variants for internal CT reconstruction. However, these approaches often neglect the significance of objects' anatomical priors for implicit learning, limiting both reconstruction precision and learning efficiency, particularly in ultra-sparse view scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 3D CT reconstruction framework that employs a 'target prior' derived from the object's projection data to enhance implicit learning. Our approach integrates positional and structural encoding to facilitate voxel-wise implicit reconstruction, utilizing the target prior to guide voxel sampling and enrich structural encoding. This dual strategy significantly boosts both learning efficiency and reconstruction quality. Additionally, we introduce a CUDA-based algorithm for rapid estimation of high-quality 3D target priors from sparse-view projections.

Progress in this area has been hindered by the lack of large-scale datasets that capture continuous reliable 3D bounding box (b-box) annotations. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce DA4D, a large-scale 4D detection dataset containing over 280k sequences with high-quality b-box annotations collected under diverse conditions.

DetAny4D fuses multi-modal features from pre-trained foundational models and designs a geometry-aware spatiotemporal decoder to effectively capture both spatial and temporal dynamics. Furthermore, it adopts a multi-task learning architecture coupled with a dedicated training strategy to maintain global consistency across sequences of varying lengths.

Recent literature has successfully explored the adaptation of commonly used image-level OOD methods--primarily based on classifier-derived confidence scores (e.g., energy or entropy)--for this pixel-precise task. However, these methods inherit a set of limitations, including vulnerability to overconfidence. In this work, we introduce SupLID, a novel framework that effectively guides classifier-derived OOD scores by exploiting the geometrical structure of the underlying semantic space, particularly using Linear Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID). While LID effectively characterizes the local structure of high-dimensional data by analyzing distance distributions, its direct application at the pixel level remains challenging. To overcome this, SupLID constructs a geometrical coreset that captures the intrinsic structure of the in-distribution (ID) subspace. It then computes OOD scores at the superpixel level, enabling both efficient real-time inference and improved spatial smoothness. We demonstrate that geometrical cues derived from SupLID serve as a complementary signal to traditional classifier confidence, enhancing the model's ability to detect diverse OOD scenarios. Designed as a post-hoc scoring method, SupLID can be seamlessly integrated with any semantic segmentation classifier at deployment time. Our results demonstrate that SupLID significantly enhances existing classifier-based OOD scores, achieving state-of-the-art performance across key evaluation metrics, including AUR, FPR, and AUP.

The pipeline comprises four stages: (1) meta-annotation collection harvesting object-, frame-, and scene-level captions, (2) scene graph construction with relation correction to capture proximal object relations, (3) discriminative object referring that generates exclusive and compact descriptions, and (4) multi-task data generation synthesizing diverse dialogues. Our pipeline systematically mitigates inherent flaws in source datasets and produces the final Disc3D dataset, over 2 million samples in 25K hybrid 3D scenes, spanning scene, view, and object captioning, visual grounding, and five object-centric QA tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training with Disc3D yields consistent, significant improvements on both public benchmarks and our multifaceted Disc3D-QA tasks.

Experimental results on ImageNet-100 demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline knowledge distillation methods, with ResNet-18 achieving 83.84\\% top-1 accuracy and MobileNetV2 achieving 81.46\\% top-1 accuracy, representing improvements of 2.04\\% and 0.92\\% respectively over traditional single-student distillation approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53cc\u5b66\u751f\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6559\u5e08\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u5b66\u751f\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u6559\u5e08\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u89c6\u540c\u4ec1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6559\u5e08\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53cc\u5b66\u751f\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ResNet-18\u548cMobileNetV2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u5b66\u751f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u4f34\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u76f8\u4e92\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet-100\u4e0a\uff0cResNet-18\u8fbe\u523083.84% top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0cMobileNetV2\u8fbe\u523081.46% top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u5b66\u751f\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53472.04%\u548c0.92%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53cc\u5b66\u751f\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5f02\u6784\u5b66\u751f\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

These conventional methods often require significant time and may vary depending on the evaluator. However, the emergence of advanced artificial intelligence techniques has created new opportunities for detecting anxiety in a more consistent and automated manner. To address the limitations of traditional approaches, this study introduces a comprehensive model that integrates deep learning architectures with optimization strategies inspired by swarm intelligence. Using multimodal and wearable-sensor datasets, the framework analyzes physiological, emotional, and behavioral signals. Swarm intelligence techniques including genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization are incorporated to refine the feature space and optimize hyperparameters. Meanwhile, deep learning components are tasked with deriving layered and discriminative representations from sequential, multi-source inputs. Our evaluation shows that the fusion of these two computational paradigms significantly enhances detection performance compared with using deep networks alone. The hybrid model achieves notable improvements in accuracy and demonstrates stronger generalization across various individuals.

While data synthesis has improved data efficiency in the image domain, its extension to video remains challenging due to pervasive temporal redundancy and complex spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we uncover a critical insight: the primary source of inefficiency in video datasets is not inter-sample redundancy, but intra-sample frame-level redundancy. To leverage this insight, we introduce VideoCompressa, a novel framework for video data synthesis that reframes the problem as dynamic latent compression. Specifically, VideoCompressa jointly optimizes a differentiable keyframe selector-implemented as a lightweight ConvNet with Gumbel-Softmax sampling-to identify the most informative frames, and a pretrained, frozen Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress these frames into compact, semantically rich latent codes. These latent representations are then fed into a compression network, enabling end-to-end backpropagation. Crucially, the keyframe selector and synthetic latent codes are co-optimized to maximize retention of task-relevant information. Experiments show that our method achieves unprecedented data efficiency: on UCF101 with ConvNets, VideoCompressa surpasses full-data training by 2.34\\% points using only 0.13\\% of the original data, with over 5800x speedup compared to traditional synthesis method.

Among flow models' accelerating methods, ReFlow has been somehow overlooked although it has theoretical consistency with flow matching. This is primarily due to its suboptimal performance in practical scenarios compared to consistency distillation and score distillation. In this work, we investigate this issue within the ReFlow framework and propose FlowSteer, a method unlocks the potential of ReFlow-based distillation by guiding the student along teacher's authentic generation trajectories. We first identify that Piecewised ReFlow's performance is hampered by a critical distribution mismatch during the training and propose Online Trajectory Alignment(OTA) to resolve it.

To tackle this issue, we present \\textbf{FVAR}, which reframes the paradigm from \\emph{next-scale prediction} to \\emph{next-focus prediction}, mimicking the natural process of camera focusing from blur to clarity. Our approach introduces three key innovations: \\textbf{1) Next-Focus Prediction Paradigm} that transforms multi-scale autoregression by progressively reducing blur rather than simply downsampling; \\textbf{2) Progressive Refocusing Pyramid Construction} that uses physics-consistent defocus kernels to build clean, alias-free multi-scale representations; and \\textbf{3) High-Frequency Residual Learning} that employs a specialized residual teacher network to effectively incorporate alias information during training while maintaining deployment simplicity. Specifically, we construct optical low-pass views using defocus point spread function (PSF) kernels with decreasing radius, creating smooth blur-to-clarity transitions that eliminate aliasing at its source. To further enhance detail generation, we introduce a High-Frequency Residual Teacher that learns from both clean structure and alias residuals, distilling this knowledge to a vanilla VAR deployment network for seamless inference.

Its advantages have led to widespread adoption in domains such as medical image segmentation. However, the existing approaches mostly overlook the potential benefits of leveraging shared features across clients, where each client contains segmentation data of different organs. In this work, we introduce a novel personalized federated approach for organ agnostic tumor segmentation (FedOAP), that utilizes cross-attention to model long-range dependencies among the shared features of different clients and a boundary-aware loss to improve segmentation consistency. FedOAP employs a decoupled cross-attention (DCA), which enables each client to retain local queries while attending to globally shared key-value pairs aggregated from all clients, thereby capturing long-range inter-organ feature dependencies. Additionally, we introduce perturbed boundary loss (PBL) which focuses on the inconsistencies of the predicted mask's boundary for each client, forcing the model to localize the margins more precisely.

However, online adaptation for 3D human pose estimation suffers from error accumulation when relying on self-supervision with imperfect predictions, leading to degraded performance over time. To mitigate this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel solution that highlights the use of motion discretization. Specifically, we employ unsupervised clustering in the latent motion representation space to derive a set of anchor motions, whose regularity aids in supervising the human pose estimator and enables efficient self-replay. Additionally, we introduce an effective and efficient soft-reset mechanism by reverting the pose estimator to its exponential moving average during continuous adaptation. We examine long-term online adaptation by continuously adapting to out-of-domain streaming test videos of the same individual, which allows for the capture of consistent personal shape and motion traits throughout the streaming observation. By mitigating error accumulation, our solution enables robust exploitation of these personal traits for enhanced accuracy.

While existing dataset distillation methods perform well on balanced datasets, they struggle under long-tailed distributions, where imbalanced class frequencies induce biased model representations and corrupt statistical estimates such as Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. In this paper, we rethink long-tailed dataset distillation by revisiting the limitations of trajectory-based methods, and instead adopt the statistical alignment perspective to jointly mitigate model bias and restore fair supervision. To this end, we introduce three dedicated components that enable unbiased recovery of distilled images and soft relabeling: (1) enhancing expert models (an observer model for recovery and a teacher model for relabeling) to enable reliable statistics estimation and soft-label generation; (2) recalibrating BN statistics via a full forward pass with dynamically adjusted momentum to reduce representation skew; (3) initializing synthetic images by incrementally selecting high-confidence and diverse augmentations via a multi-round mechanism that promotes coverage and diversity. Extensive experiments on four long-tailed benchmarks show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across varying degrees of class imbalance.Notably, our approach improves top-1 accuracy by 15.6% on CIFAR-100-LT and 11.8% on Tiny-ImageNet-LT under IPC=10 and IF=10.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u957f\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u89d2\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u548cBN\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u957f\u5c3e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u504f\u5dee\u548cBN\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f30\u8ba1\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u589e\u5f3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6BN\u7edf\u8ba1\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8868\u793a\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u673a\u5236\u589e\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6765\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u957f\u5c3e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728CIFAR-100-LT\u548cTiny-ImageNet-LT\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534715.6%\u548c11.8%\u7684top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u84b8\u998f\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In pursuit of continuous gains, these approaches have evolved toward increasingly sophisticated architectures with multi-stage pipelines, specialized fusion modules, edge-guided learning, and elaborate attention mechanisms. However, this complexity paradoxically introduces feature redundancy and cross-component interference that obscure salient cues, ultimately reaching performance bottlenecks. In contrast, human vision achieves efficient salient object identification without such architectural complexity. This contrast raises a fundamental question: can we design a biologically grounded yet architecturally simple SOD framework that dispenses with most of this engineering complexity, while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability? In this work, we answer this question affirmatively by introducing DualGazeNet, a biologically inspired pure Transformer framework that models the dual biological principles of robust representation learning and magnocellular-parvocellular dual-pathway processing with cortical attention modulation in the human visual system. Extensive experiments on five RGB SOD benchmarks show that DualGazeNet consistently surpasses 25 state-of-the-art CNN- and Transformer-based methods.

Despite its success, the representational capacity of 3DGS remains limited by the use of 3D Gaussian kernels to model local variations. Recent works have proposed to augment 3DGS with additional per-primitive capacity, such as per-splat textures, to enhance its expressiveness. However, these per-splat texture approaches primarily target dense novel view synthesis with a reduced number of Gaussian primitives, and their effectiveness tends to diminish when applied to more general reconstruction scenarios. In this paper, we aim to achieve concrete performance improvement over state-of-the-art 3DGS variants across a wide range of reconstruction tasks, including novel view synthesis, geometry and dynamic reconstruction, under both sparse and dense input settings. To this end, we introduce Neural Texture Splatting (NTS). At the core of our approach is a global neural field (represented as a hybrid of a tri-plane and a neural decoder) that predicts local appearance and geometric fields for each primitive. By leveraging this shared global representation that models local texture fields across primitives, we significantly reduce model size and facilitate efficient global information exchange, demonstrating strong generalization across tasks. Furthermore, our neural modeling of local texture fields introduces expressive view- and time-dependent effects, a critical aspect that existing methods fail to account for. Extensive experiments show that Neural Texture Splatting consistently improves models and achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Neural Texture Splatting (NTS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a3D\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u9884\u6d4b\u5c40\u90e8\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u573a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u867d\u7136\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4f7f\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af\u6838\u5efa\u6a21\u5c40\u90e8\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6bcf\u4e2a\u57fa\u5143\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\uff08\u4e09\u5e73\u9762\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff09\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u57fa\u5143\u9884\u6d4b\u5c40\u90e8\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u573a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cNeural Texture Splatting\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u8f93\u5165\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u5efa\u6a21\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u573a\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Naively pruning less-informative visual tokens reduces this burden, yet indiscriminate removal can strip away contextual cues essential for background or fine-grained questions, undermining accuracy. In this paper, we present ParVTS (Parallel Vision Token Scheduling), a training-free scheduling framework that partitions visual tokens into subject and non-subject groups, processes them in parallel to transfer their semantics into question tokens, and discards the non-subject path mid-inference to reduce computation. This scheduling reduces computational complexity, requires no heuristics or additional modules, and is compatible with diverse existing MLLM architectures. Experiments across multiple MLLM backbones show that ParVTS prunes up to 88.9% of visual tokens with minimal performance drop, achieving 1.77x speedup and 70% FLOPs reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "ParVTS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9token\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u4e3b\u4f53\u548c\u975e\u4e3b\u4f53\u7ec4\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u671f\u4e22\u5f03\u975e\u4e3b\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9token\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u526a\u679d\u89c6\u89c9token\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faParVTS\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9token\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u4e3b\u4f53\u548c\u975e\u4e3b\u4f53\u7ec4\uff1b2\uff09\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u4e24\u7ec4token\u4ee5\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u95ee\u9898token\u4e2d\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u671f\u4e22\u5f03\u975e\u4e3b\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMLLM\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cParVTS\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u526a\u679d88.9%\u7684\u89c6\u89c9token\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u6781\u5c0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b01.77\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u548c70%\u7684FLOPs\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "ParVTS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u6709MLLM\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

Although machine learning-based approaches to support photovoltaic (PV) planning on rooftops are well researched, automated approaches for facades still remain scarce and oversimplified. This paper therefore presents a pipeline that integrates detailed information on the architectural composition of the facade to automatically identify suitable surfaces for PV application and estimate the solar energy potential. The pipeline fine-tunes SegFormer-B5 on the CMP Facades dataset and converts semantic predictions into facade-level PV suitability masks and PV panel layouts considering module sizes and clearances. Applied to a dataset of 373 facades with known dimensions from ten cities, the results show that installable BIPV potential is significantly lower than theoretical potential, thus providing valuable insights for reliable urban energy planning. With the growing availability of facade imagery, the proposed pipeline can be scaled to support BIPV planning in cities worldwide.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5efa\u7b51\u7acb\u9762\u8be6\u7ec6\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5149\u4f0f\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8868\u9762\u5e76\u4f30\u7b97\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SegFormer-B5\u5728CMP Facades\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7acb\u9762\u7ea7\u5149\u4f0f\u9002\u7528\u6027\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u5149\u4f0f\u9762\u677f\u5e03\u5c40\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7b51\u96c6\u6210\u5149\u4f0f\u7acb\u9762\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u57ce\u5e02\u8131\u78b3\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c4b\u9876\u9762\u79ef\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u5730\u9762\u5b89\u88c5\u9635\u5217\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c4b\u9876\u5149\u4f0f\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u6709\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u9488\u5bf9\u7acb\u9762\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u7136\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5728CMP Facades\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03SegFormer-B5\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8003\u8651\u6a21\u5757\u5c3a\u5bf8\u548c\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u7acb\u9762\u7ea7\u5149\u4f0f\u9002\u7528\u6027\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u5149\u4f0f\u9762\u677f\u5e03\u5c40\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6765\u81ea10\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u7684373\u4e2a\u5df2\u77e5\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7acb\u9762\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u53ef\u5b89\u88c5BIPV\u6f5c\u529b\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u80fd\u6e90\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9d\u8d35\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u7740\u7acb\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65e5\u76ca\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u652f\u6301\u5168\u7403\u57ce\u5e02\u7684BIPV\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

Although they achieve impressive results, two key limitations remain. First, they fail to fully exploit the correspondence between instruction-driven scene motion and the underlying 3D geometry, which results in structural instability under viewpoint changes. Second, they easily forget historical information during multi-step interaction, resulting in error accumulation and progressive drift in scene semantics and structure. To address these issues, we propose MagicWorld, an interactive video world model that integrates 3D geometric priors and historical retrieval. MagicWorld starts from a single scene image, employs user actions to drive dynamic scene evolution, and autoregressively synthesizes continuous scenes. We introduce the Action-Guided 3D Geometry Module (AG3D), which constructs a point cloud from the first frame of each interaction and the corresponding action, providing explicit geometric constraints for viewpoint transitions and thereby improving structural consistency. We further propose History Cache Retrieval (HCR) mechanism, which retrieves relevant historical frames during generation and injects them as conditioning signals, helping the model utilize past scene information and mitigate error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that MagicWorld achieves notable improvements in scene stability and continuity across interaction iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "MagicWorld\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u54083D\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c423D\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u6b65\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u9057\u5fd8\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u573a\u666f\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMagicWorld\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1\uff09\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f15\u5bfc3D\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u5757\uff08AG3D\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u6bcf\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u9996\u5e27\u6784\u5efa\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u6362\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b2\uff09\u5386\u53f2\u7f13\u5b58\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff08HCR\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u5386\u53f2\u5e27\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u8fc7\u53bb\u573a\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMagicWorld\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u573a\u666f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MagicWorld\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u54083D\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u6301\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper has been accepted for publication in AAAI-2026", "summary": "Remote sensing images are becoming increasingly widespread in military, earth resource exploration. Because of the limitation of a single sensor, we can obtain high spatial resolution grayscale panchromatic (PAN) images and low spatial resolution color multispectral (MS) images. Therefore, an important issue is to obtain a color image with high spatial resolution when there is only a PAN image at the input. The existing methods improve spatial resolution using super-resolution (SR) technology and spectral recovery using colorization technology. However, the SR technique cannot improve the spectral resolution, and the colorization technique cannot improve the spatial resolution. Moreover, the pansharpening method needs two registered inputs and can not achieve SR. As a result, an integrated approach is expected. To solve the above problems, we designed a novel multi-function model (MFmamba) to realize the tasks of SR, spectral recovery, joint SR and spectral recovery through three different inputs.

Existing methods typically rely on global noise assumptions or confidence-based sample selection, which inadequately mitigate the performance degradation caused by annotation noise, especially in challenging boundary regions. To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy ground-truth labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries. This strategy enables more precise handling of structural boundaries, which are often overlooked by existing methods, and significantly enhances segmentation performance.

However, its performance is fundamentally limited by the ambiguity of textual visual correspondence: a single prompt may validly describe diverse visual outputs, and a single image or video may support multiple equally correct interpretations. This many to many relationship leads reward models to generate uncertain and weakly discriminative signals, causing GRPO to underutilize reliable feedback and overfit noisy ones. We introduce Bayesian Prior-Guided Optimization (BPGO), a novel extension of GRPO that explicitly models reward uncertainty through a semantic prior anchor. BPGO adaptively modulates optimization trust at two levels: inter-group Bayesian trust allocation emphasizes updates from groups consistent with the prior while down-weighting ambiguous ones, and intra-group prior-anchored renormalization sharpens sample distinctions by expanding confident deviations and compressing uncertain scores.

Inspired by event-based vision, we propose an event-guided, training-free framework for efficient spatio-temporal understanding, named EventSTU. In the temporal domain, we design a coarse-to-fine keyframe sampling algorithm that exploits the change-triggered property of event cameras to eliminate redundant frames. In the spatial domain, we design an adaptive token pruning algorithm that leverages the visual saliency of events as a zero-cost prior to guide spatial reduction. From a holistic spatio-temporal perspective, we further integrate question relevance from keyframe sampling to adaptively allocate token pruning budgets.

While such threats have been extensively studied in unimodal settings, their impact on multimodal foundation models, particularly vision-language models (VLMs), remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{BackdoorVLM}, the first comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating backdoor attacks on VLMs across a broad range of settings. It adopts a unified perspective that injects and analyzes backdoors across core vision-language tasks, including image captioning and visual question answering. BackdoorVLM organizes multimodal backdoor threats into 5 representative categories: targeted refusal, malicious injection, jailbreak, concept substitution, and perceptual hijack. Each category captures a distinct pathway through which an adversary can manipulate a model's behavior. We evaluate these threats using 12 representative attack methods spanning text, image, and bimodal triggers, tested on 2 open-source VLMs and 3 multimodal datasets. Our analysis reveals that VLMs exhibit strong sensitivity to textual instructions, and in bimodal backdoors the text trigger typically overwhelms the image trigger when forming the backdoor mapping. Notably, backdoors involving the textual modality remain highly potent, with poisoning rates as low as 1\\% yielding over 90\\% success across most tasks. These findings highlight significant, previously underexplored vulnerabilities in current VLMs. We hope that BackdoorVLM can serve as a useful benchmark for analyzing and mitigating multimodal backdoor threats.

By consistently handling varying sparsities of conditioning frames through a Unified Masked Conditioning (UMC) mechanism, One4D can seamlessly transition between 4D generation from a single image, 4D reconstruction from a full video, and mixed generation and reconstruction from sparse frames. Our framework adapts a powerful video generation model for joint RGB and pointmap generation, with carefully designed network architectures. The commonly used diffusion finetuning strategies for depthmap or pointmap reconstruction often fail on joint RGB and pointmap generation, quickly degrading the base video model. To address this challenge, we introduce Decoupled LoRA Control (DLC), which employs two modality-specific LoRA adapters to form decoupled computation branches for RGB frames and pointmaps, connected by lightweight, zero-initialized control links that gradually learn mutual pixel-level consistency. Trained on a mixture of synthetic and real 4D datasets under modest computational budgets, One4D produces high-quality RGB frames and accurate pointmaps across both generation and reconstruction tasks. This work represents a step toward general, high-quality geometry-based 4D world modeling using video diffusion models.

We demonstrate that attention entropy minimization improves robustness across diverse corruption types while not hurting performance on clean data on a single sample stream of images at test time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316CLS\u4ee4\u724c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u71b5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff0c\u800ctransformer\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u6700\u5c0f\u5316CLS\u4ee4\u724c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u71b5\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u66f4\u81ea\u4fe1\u5730\u5173\u6ce8\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5355\u5f20\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0b\u4e5f\u6709\u6548\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u635f\u574f\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u90fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4e0d\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u5355\u6837\u672c\u6d41\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528transformer\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In support of this framework, we design a hierarchical contrastive learning module that encourages the text encoder to produce more discriminative embeddings for our novel control signals, thereby improving motion controllability.

Standard FM encourages the learned velocity field to follow a target direction; however, it may accumulate errors along the trajectory and drive samples off the data manifold, leading to perceptual degradation, especially in lightweight or low-step configurations.\n  To enhance stability and generalization, we extend FM into a balanced attract-repel scheme that provides explicit guidance on both \"where to go\" and \"where not to go.\" To be formal, we propose \\textbf{Velocity Contrastive Regularization (VeCoR)}, a complementary training scheme for flow-based generative modeling that augments the standard FM objective with contrastive, two-sided supervision. VeCoR not only aligns the predicted velocity with a stable reference direction (positive supervision) but also pushes it away from inconsistent, off-manifold directions (negative supervision).

However, this is a costly and labor-intensive technique, for which virtual staining, as an image-to-image translation task, offers a promising alternative. Although recent, this is an emerging field of research with 64% of published studies just in 2024. Most studies use publicly available datasets of H&E-IHC pairs from consecutive tissue sections. Recognizing the training challenges, many authors develop complex virtual staining models based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, but ignore the impact of adversarial loss on the quality of virtual staining. Furthermore, overlooking the issues of model evaluation, they claim improved performance based on metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, which are not sufficiently robust to evaluate the quality of virtually stained images. In this paper, we developed CSSP2P GAN, which we demonstrate to achieve heightened pathological fidelity through a blind pathological expert evaluation. Furthermore, while iteratively developing our model, we study the impact of the adversarial loss and demonstrate its crucial role in the quality of virtually stained images. Finally, while comparing our model with reference works in the field, we underscore the limitations of the currently used evaluation metrics and demonstrate the superior performance of CSSP2P GAN.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86CSSP2P GAN\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u865a\u62df\u67d3\u8272\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f2\u6cd5\u75c5\u7406\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u865a\u62df\u67d3\u8272\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u514d\u75ab\u7ec4\u5316\u67d3\u8272\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u865a\u62df\u67d3\u8272\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u865a\u62df\u67d3\u8272\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u591f\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86CSSP2P GAN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76f2\u6cd5\u75c5\u7406\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "CSSP2P GAN\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u635f\u5931\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u865a\u62df\u67d3\u8272\u8d28\u91cf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u865a\u62df\u67d3\u8272\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u5174\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cCSSP2P GAN\u5728\u75c5\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u635f\u5931\u5728\u865a\u62df\u67d3\u8272\u4e2d\u8d77\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

However, its practical adoption is hindered by two critical limitations. First, the reliance on a single garment image as input in current virtual try-on datasets limits the accurate capture of realistic texture details. Second, most existing methods focus solely on generating full-shot virtual try-on videos, neglecting the business's demand for videos that also provide detailed close-ups. To address these challenges, we introduce a high-resolution dataset for video-based virtual try-on. This dataset offers two key features. First, it provides more detailed information on the garments, which includes high-fidelity images with detailed close-ups and textual descriptions; Second, it uniquely includes full-shot and close-up try-on videos of real human models. Furthermore, accurately assessing consistency becomes significantly more critical for the close-up videos, which demand high-fidelity preservation of garment details. To facilitate such fine-grained evaluation, we propose a new garment consistency metric VGID (Video Garment Inception Distance) that quantifies the preservation of both texture and structure. Our experiments validate these contributions. We demonstrate that by utilizing the detailed images from our dataset, existing video generation models can extract and incorporate texture features, significantly enhancing the realism and detail fidelity of virtual try-on results. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of recent models. The benchmark effectively identifies the texture and structural preservation problems among current methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8be6\u7ec6\u670d\u88c5\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5168\u8eab\u548c\u7279\u5199\u8bd5\u7a7f\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VGID\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u670d\u88c5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\u6355\u6349\u548c\u7279\u5199\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a1) \u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u670d\u88c5\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b2) \u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u5168\u8eab\u8bd5\u7a7f\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5546\u4e1a\u5bf9\u7279\u5199\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8be6\u7ec6\u670d\u88c5\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u7279\u5199\u955c\u5934\u3001\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u8eab\u53ca\u7279\u5199\u8bd5\u7a7f\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u63d0\u51faVGID\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u670d\u88c5\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u878d\u5165\u7eb9\u7406\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cVGID\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\u6355\u6349\u548c\u7279\u5199\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5728\u7535\u5546\u8425\u9500\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Automated detection of such events could enable early warning systems and objective training feedback. In this work, we propose CataractCompDetect, a complication detection framework that combines phase-aware localization, SAM 2-based tracking, complication-specific risk scoring, and vision-language reasoning for final classification. To validate CataractCompDetect, we curate CataComp, the first cataract surgery video dataset annotated for intraoperative complications, comprising 53 surgeries, including 23 with clinical complications.

These advances enable efficient, end-to-end FHE inference across diverse CNN architectures. Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and MS COCO demonstrate that the FHE-friendly CNNs obtained via our SFT strategy achieve accuracy comparable to baselines using ReLU or SiLU activations.

Vision-language foundation models (VLMs), pre-trained on paired image-text corpora, learn joint representations that bridge visual features and diagnostic terminology, enabling zero-shot localization and classification of tissue regions without pixel-level labels. However, most existing VLM applications in histopathology remain limited to slide-level tasks or rely on coarse interactive prompts, and they struggle to produce fine-grained segmentations across gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs). In this work, we introduce a zero-shot visual-language segmentation pipeline for whole-slide images (ZEUS), a fully automated, zero-shot segmentation framework that leverages class-specific textual prompt ensembles and frozen VLM encoders to generate high-resolution tumor masks in WSIs. By partitioning each WSI into overlapping patches, extracting visual embeddings, and computing cosine similarities against text prompts, we generate a final segmentation mask. We demonstrate competitive performance on two in-house datasets, primary spindle cell neoplasms and cutaneous metastases, highlighting the influence of prompt design, domain shifts, and institutional variability in VLMs for histopathology.

Although existing methods have progressed from single-modal to multimodal approaches, they face critical limitations: single-modal methods struggle with feature degradation under data compression in social media streaming, while multimodal approaches require expensive data collection and labeling and suffer from inconsistent modal quality or accessibility in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Unimodal-generated Multimodal Contrastive Learning (UMCL) framework for robust cross-compression-rate (CCR) deepfake detection. In the training stage, our approach transforms a single visual modality into three complementary features: compression-robust rPPG signals, temporal landmark dynamics, and semantic embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models. These features are explicitly aligned through an affinity-driven semantic alignment (ASA) strategy, which models inter-modal relationships through affinity matrices and optimizes their consistency through contrastive learning. Subsequently, our cross-quality similarity learning (CQSL) strategy enhances feature robustness across compression rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across various compression rates and manipulation types, establishing a new benchmark for robust deepfake detection.

Much of the existing research in this field has relied on the PlantVillage dataset, which consists of well-centered plant images captured against uniform, uncluttered backgrounds. Although models trained on this dataset achieve high accuracy, they often fail to generalize to real-world field images, such as those submitted by farmers to plant diagnostic systems. This has created a significant gap between published studies and practical application requirements, highlighting the necessity of investigating and addressing this issue. In this study, we investigate whether attention-based architectures and zero-shot learning approaches can bridge the gap between curated academic datasets and real-world agricultural conditions in plant disease classification. We evaluate three model categories: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers, and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based zero-shot models. While CNNs exhibit limited robustness under domain shift, Vision Transformers demonstrate stronger generalization by capturing global contextual features. Most notably, CLIP models classify diseases directly from natural language descriptions without any task-specific training, offering strong adaptability and interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of zero-shot learning as a practical and scalable domain adaptation strategy for plant health diagnosis in diverse field environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5426\u5f25\u5408\u690d\u7269\u75c5\u5bb3\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5b66\u672f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u519c\u4e1a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CLIP\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u76f4\u63a5\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u5206\u7c7b\u75c5\u5bb3\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8ePlantVillage\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u867d\u7136\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7530\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5728\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(CNNs)\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668(Vision Transformers)\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bed\u8a00-\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3(CLIP)\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "CNNs\u5728\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800cCLIP\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u5206\u7c7b\u75c5\u5bb3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u690d\u7269\u5065\u5eb7\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7530\u95f4\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

Motivated by recent findings on representation alignment for diffusion models, we hypothesize that improving the multi-view consistency of video diffusion representations will yield more 3D-consistent video generation. Through detailed analysis on multiple recent camera-controlled video diffusion models we reveal strong correlations between 3D-consistent representations and videos.

We evaluate ViCoDR on camera controlled image-to-video, text-to-video, and multi-view generation models, demonstrating significant improvements in the 3D consistency of the generated videos.

However, the scarcity of Text-LiDAR pairs often causes insufficient training priors, generating overly smooth 3D scenes. Moreover, low-quality text descriptions may degrade generation quality and controllability. In this paper, we propose a Text-to-LiDAR Diffusion Model for scene generation, named T2LDM, with a Self-Conditioned Representation Guidance (SCRG). Specifically, SCRG, by aligning to the real representations, provides the soft supervision with reconstruction details for the Denoising Network (DN) in training, while decoupled in inference. In this way, T2LDM can perceive rich geometric structures from data distribution, generating detailed objects in scenes. Meanwhile, we construct a content-composable Text-LiDAR benchmark, T2nuScenes, along with a controllability metric. Based on this, we analyze the effects of different text prompts for LiDAR generation quality and controllability, providing practical prompt paradigms and insights. Furthermore, a directional position prior is designed to mitigate street distortion, further improving scene fidelity. Additionally, by learning a conditional encoder via frozen DN, T2LDM can support multiple conditional tasks, including Sparse-to-Dense, Dense-to-Sparse, and Semantic-to-LiDAR generation. Extensive experiments in unconditional and conditional generation demonstrate that T2LDM outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art scene generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faT2LDM\u6587\u672c\u5230LiDAR\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6761\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc(SCRG)\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c-LiDAR\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u672c\u5230LiDAR\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e30\u5bcc\u76843D\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u6587\u672c-LiDAR\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u7a00\u7f3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u4e14\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faT2LDM\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u6761\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc(SCRG)\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f6f\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u89e3\u8026\uff1b\u6784\u5efaT2nuScenes\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u5411\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5148\u9a8c\u51cf\u5c11\u8857\u9053\u626d\u66f2\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3\u53bb\u566a\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cT2LDM\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "T2LDM\u901a\u8fc7SCRG\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u611f\u77e5\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec6\u573a\u666f\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230LiDAR\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Existing evaluation paradigms exhibit two major limitations: 1) the dominance of low-discriminative samples in current datasets masks the real robustness gap between models; and 2) conventional accuracy-based metric fail to capture the degradation of the underlying prediction structure. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Bench-C, a comprehensive benchmark emphasizing discriminative samples for assessing corruption robustness, where a selection strategy is proposed to jointly consider the prediction inconsistency under corruption and the semantic diversity. Furthermore, we propose the Robustness Alignment Score (RAS), a unified metric that measures degradation in logit-level prediction structure by considering the shifts in prediction uncertainty and calibration alignment. Comprehensive experiments and analysis reveal several interesting findings: 1) model behaviors exhibit distinguish patterns under corruptions, such as erroneous confidence and hesitation; 2) despite subtle corruption may lead to a slight accuracy gain, the overall prediction structure still degrades; 3) by decomposing corruption robustness into destructive and corrective components, the distinct failure and recovery patterns across models can be revealed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Bench-C\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cRAS\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u635f\u574f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5224\u522b\u6027\u6837\u672c\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u6784\u9000\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\uff1a1) \u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u4f4e\u5224\u522b\u6027\u6837\u672c\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b2) \u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5e95\u5c42\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9000\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Bench-C\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u635f\u574f\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5f3a\u8c03\u5224\u522b\u6027\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u63d0\u51faRAS\u7edf\u4e00\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u6d4b\u91cflogit\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9000\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u635f\u574f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5982\u9519\u8bef\u7f6e\u4fe1\u548c\u72b9\u8c6b\uff1b2) \u8f7b\u5fae\u635f\u574f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7565\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u6784\u4ecd\u4f1a\u9000\u5316\uff1b3) \u5c06\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7834\u574f\u6027\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u6027\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u53ef\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u548c\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "Bench-C\u548cRAS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u6784\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While recent attempts leverage MLLMs for exploration due to their strong perceptual and reasoning abilities, we find that MLLM-based embodied agents remain suboptimal in exploring new environments: (i) they rely on profound but stale pre-trained knowledge, (ii) training-based approaches such as imitation learning or reinforcement learning are expensive for long-horizon tasks with sparse outcome rewards, and (iii) frontier-based exploration yields a large, visually nuanced action space that is difficult for MLLMs to make reliable decisions. We address these challenges with ReEXplore, a training-free framework that performs retrospective experience replay to inject distilled, abstract experience at inference time, and hierarchical frontier selection to decompose frontier ranking into coarse-to-fine decisions.

In conflict zones, damaged zones often share similar architectural styles, with damage typically covering small areas and exhibiting blurred boundaries. These characteristics lead to limited data, annotation difficulties, and significant recognition challenges, including high intra-class similarity and ambiguous semantic changes. To address these issues, we introduce a pre-trained DINOv3 model and propose a multi-scale cross-attention difference siamese network (MC-DiSNet). The powerful visual representation capability of the DINOv3 backbone enables robust and rich feature extraction from bi-temporal remote sensing images. We also release a new Gaza-change dataset containing high-resolution satellite image pairs from 2023-2024 with pixel-level semantic change annotations. It is worth emphasizing that our annotations only include semantic pixels of changed areas. Unlike conventional semantic change detection (SCD), our approach eliminates the need for large-scale semantic annotations of bi-temporal images, instead focusing directly on the changed regions. We term this new task change semantic detection (CSD). The CSD task represents a direct extension of binary change detection (BCD). Due to the limited spatial extent of semantic regions, it presents greater challenges than traditional SCD tasks. We evaluated our method under the CSD framework on both the Gaza-Change and SECOND datasets.

To address this, we conduct a formal analysis of DPO loss through updating policy within the diffusion framework, which describes how the updating of specific training samples influences the model's predictions on other samples. Using this tool, we identify two main failure modes: (1) Optimization Conflict, which arises from small reward margins between chosen and rejected samples, and (2) Suboptimal Maximization, caused by large reward margins. Informed by these insights, we introduce a novel solution named Policy-Guided DPO (PG-DPO), combining Adaptive Rejection Scaling (ARS) and Implicit Preference Regularization (IPR) to effectively mitigate likelihood displacement. Experiments show that PG-DPO outperforms existing methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, offering a robust solution for improving preference alignment in video generation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "PG-DPO\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u62d2\u7edd\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u597d\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u89e3\u51b3DPO\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u4f4d\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "DPO\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u4f4d\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5206\u6790DPO\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPG-DPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u62d2\u7edd\u7f29\u653e(ARS)\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u597d\u6b63\u5219\u5316(IPR)\u3002", "result": "PG-DPO\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PG-DPO\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Typical pre-trained models, notably Segmentation Anything Model (SAM), generate prompts directly at a single granularity level. However, this approach has two limitations: (1) Localizability, lacking mechanisms for autonomous region localization; (2) Scalability, limited fine-grained modeling at high resolution. To address these challenges, we introduce Granular Computing-driven SAM (Grc-SAM), a coarse-to-fine framework motivated by Granular Computing (GrC). First, the coarse stage adaptively extracts high-response regions from features to achieve precise foreground localization and reduce reliance on external prompts. Second, the fine stage applies finer patch partitioning with sparse local swin-style attention to enhance detail modeling and enable high-resolution segmentation. Third, refined masks are encoded as latent prompt embeddings for the SAM decoder, replacing handcrafted prompts with an automated reasoning process. By integrating multi-granularity attention, Grc-SAM bridges granular computing with vision transformers. Extensive experimental results demonstrate Grc-SAM outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and scalability.

Unlike prior works, DynaMix dynamically adapts to the structure and noise of the training data through three core components: (1) a Relabeling Module that refines pseudo-labels of single-camera identities on-the-fly; (2) an Efficient Centroids Module that maintains robust identity representations under a large identity space; and (3) a Data Sampling Module that carefully composes mixed data mini-batches to balance learning complexity and intra-batch diversity. All components are specifically designed to operate efficiently at scale, enabling effective training on millions of images and hundreds of thousands of identities.

Additionally, most SAM-based methods still rely on manual prompts, which are challenging to implement in real-world scenarios and require extensive external expert knowledge.

Existing benchmarks often simplify pedestrian interactions, failing to capture complex, dynamic intentions and varied responses critical for robust system deployment. To overcome this, we introduce HABIT (Human Action Benchmark for Interactive Traffic), a high-fidelity simulation benchmark. HABIT integrates real-world human motion, sourced from mocap and videos, into CARLA (Car Learning to Act, a full autonomous driving simulator) via a modular, extensible, and physically consistent motion retargeting pipeline. From an initial pool of approximately 30,000 retargeted motions, we curate 4,730 traffic-compatible pedestrian motions, standardized in SMPL format for physically consistent trajectories. HABIT seamlessly integrates with CARLA's Leaderboard, enabling automated scenario generation and rigorous agent evaluation. Our safety metrics, including Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and False Positive Braking Rate (FPBR), reveal critical failure modes in state-of-the-art AD agents missed by prior evaluations. Evaluating three state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents, InterFuser, TransFuser, and BEVDriver, demonstrates how HABIT exposes planner weaknesses that remain hidden in scripted simulations. Despite achieving close or equal to zero collisions per kilometer on the CARLA Leaderboard, the autonomous agents perform notably worse on HABIT, with up to 7.43 collisions/km and a 12.94% AIS 3+ injury risk, and they brake unnecessarily in up to 33% of cases.

DiffSeg30k features: 1) In-the-wild images--we collect images or image prompts from COCO to reflect real-world content diversity; 2) Diverse diffusion models--local edits using eight SOTA diffusion models; 3) Multi-turn editing--each image undergoes up to three sequential edits to mimic real-world sequential editing; and 4) Realistic editing scenarios--a vision-language model (VLM)-based pipeline automatically identifies meaningful regions and generates context-aware prompts covering additions, removals, and attribute changes. DiffSeg30k shifts AIGC detection from binary classification to semantic segmentation, enabling simultaneous localization of edits and identification of the editing models. We benchmark three baseline segmentation approaches, revealing significant challenges in semantic segmentation tasks, particularly concerning robustness to image distortions. Experiments also reveal that segmentation models, despite being trained for pixel-level localization, emerge as highly reliable whole-image classifiers of diffusion edits, outperforming established forgery classifiers while showing great potential in cross-generator generalization. We believe DiffSeg30k will advance research in fine-grained localization of AI-generated content by demonstrating the promise and limitations of segmentation-based methods.

Existing thermal super-resolution (SR) methods can be grouped into single-image and RGB-guided approaches: the former struggles to recover fine structures from limited information, while the latter relies on accurate and laborious cross-camera calibration, which hinders practical deployment and robustness. Here, we propose 3M-TI, a calibration-free Multi-camera cross-Modality diffusion framework for Mobile Thermal Imaging. At its core, 3M-TI integrates a cross-modal self-attention module (CSM) into the diffusion UNet, replacing the original self-attention layers to adaptively align thermal and RGB features throughout the denoising process, without requiring explicit camera calibration. This design enables the diffusion network to leverage its generative prior to enhance spatial resolution, structural fidelity, and texture detail in the super-resolved thermal images. Extensive evaluations on real-world mobile thermal cameras and public benchmarks validate our superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in both visual quality and quantitative metrics. More importantly, the thermal images enhanced by 3M-TI lead to substantial gains in critical downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation, underscoring its practical value for robust mobile thermal perception systems.

Although CLIP-based detectors exhibit promising generalization, they often rely on semantic cues rather than generator artifacts, leading to brittle performance under distribution shifts. In this work, we revisit the nature of semantic bias and uncover that Patch Shuffle provides an unusually strong benefit for CLIP, that disrupts global semantic continuity while preserving local artifact cues, which reduces semantic entropy and homogenizes feature distributions between natural and synthetic images. Through a detailed layer-wise analysis, we further show that CLIP's deep semantic structure functions as a regulator that stabilizes cross-domain representations once semantic bias is suppressed. Guided by these findings, we propose SemAnti, a semantic-antagonistic fine-tuning paradigm that freezes the semantic subspace and adapts only artifact-sensitive layers under shuffled semantics.

Recent advances in Foundation Models (FMs) have introduced new opportunities for leveraging external semantic knowledge to guide SFDA. However, relying on a single FM is often insufficient, as it tends to bias adaptation toward a restricted semantic coverage, failing to capture diverse contextual cues under domain shift. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Collaborative Multi-foundation Adaptation (CoMA) framework that jointly leverages two different FMs (e.g., CLIP and BLIP) with complementary properties to capture both global semantics and local contextual cues. Specifically, we employ a bidirectional adaptation mechanism that (1) aligns different FMs with the target model for task adaptation while maintaining their semantic distinctiveness, and (2) transfers complementary knowledge from the FMs to the target model. To ensure stable adaptation under mini-batch training, we introduce Decomposed Mutual Information (DMI) that selectively enhances true dependencies while suppressing false dependencies arising from incomplete class coverage.

This highlights the critical need to enhance restoration quality and adapt flexibly to various image restoration tasks or backbones without requiring model retraining and ideally without labor-intensive preference data collection. In this paper, we propose the first Test-Time Preference Optimization (TTPO) paradigm for image restoration, which enhances perceptual quality, generates preference data on-the-fly, and is compatible with any IR model backbone. Specifically, we design a training-free, three-stage pipeline: (i) generate candidate preference images online using diffusion inversion and denoising based on the initially restored image; (ii) select preferred and dispreferred images using automated preference-aligned metrics or human feedback; and (iii) use the selected preference images as reward signals to guide the diffusion denoising process, optimizing the restored image to better align with human preferences.

However, how to efficiently and stably achieve high-quality geometric fidelity remains a core challenge. To address this issue, we introduce MetroGS, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework for efficient and robust reconstruction in complex urban environments. Our method is built upon a distributed 2D Gaussian Splatting representation as the core foundation, serving as a unified backbone for subsequent modules. To handle potential sparse regions in complex scenes, we propose a structured dense enhancement scheme that utilizes SfM priors and a pointmap model to achieve a denser initialization, while incorporating a sparsity compensation mechanism to improve reconstruction completeness. Furthermore, we design a progressive hybrid geometric optimization strategy that organically integrates monocular and multi-view optimization to achieve efficient and accurate geometric refinement. Finally, to address the appearance inconsistency commonly observed in large-scale scenes, we introduce a depth-guided appearance modeling approach that learns spatial features with 3D consistency, facilitating effective decoupling between geometry and appearance and further enhancing reconstruction stability.

Active Learning (AL) aims to mitigate this challenge by querying only the most informative samples, thereby reducing annotation effort. However, in the domain of 3D biomedical imaging, there is no consensus on whether AL consistently outperforms Random sampling. Four evaluation pitfalls hinder the current methodological assessment. These are (1) restriction to too few datasets and annotation budgets, (2) using 2D models on 3D images without partial annotations, (3) Random baseline not being adapted to the task, and (4) measuring annotation cost only in voxels. In this work, we introduce nnActive, an open-source AL framework that overcomes these pitfalls by (1) means of a large scale study spanning four biomedical imaging datasets and three label regimes, (2) extending nnU-Net by using partial annotations for training with 3D patch-based query selection, (3) proposing Foreground Aware Random sampling strategies tackling the foreground-background class imbalance of medical images and (4) propose the foreground efficiency metric, which captures the low annotation cost of background-regions. We reveal the following findings: (A) while all AL methods outperform standard Random sampling, none reliably surpasses an improved Foreground Aware Random sampling; (B) benefits of AL depend on task specific parameters; (C) Predictive Entropy is overall the best performing AL method, but likely requires the most annotation effort; (D) AL performance can be improved with more compute intensive design choices. As a holistic, open-source framework, nnActive can serve as a catalyst for research and application of AL in 3D biomedical imaging.

Obtaining these data from real patients and during surgery is very demanding, if even possible, due to legal, ethical, and technical challenges. It is especially difficult for soft tissue organs with poor imaging contrast, such as the prostate. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel workflow for automated 3D anatomical data generation using data obtained from physical organ models. We additionally use a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to obtain a manifold of 3D models useful for other downstream machine learning tasks that rely on 3D data. We demonstrate our workflow using an artificial prostate model made of biomimetic hydrogels with imaging contrast in multiple zones. This is used to physically simulate endoscopic surgery. For evaluation and 3D data generation, we place it into a customized ultrasound scanner that records the prostate before and after the procedure. A neural network is trained to segment the recorded ultrasound images, which outperforms conventional, non-learning-based computer vision techniques in terms of intersection over union (IoU).

We introduce CLASH, a novel benchmark for multimodal contradiction detection, featuring COCO images paired with contradictory captions containing controlled object-level or attribute-level contradictions. The samples include targeted questions evaluated in both multiple-choice and open-ended formats.

We investigate whether frontier VLMs demonstrate genuine visual grounding when answering Italian medical questions by testing four state-of-the-art models: Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini 2.0 flash exp. Using 60 questions from the EuropeMedQA Italian dataset that explicitly require image interpretation, we substitute correct medical images with blank placeholders to test whether models truly integrate visual and textual information. Our results reveal striking variability in visual dependency: GPT-4o shows the strongest visual grounding with a 27.9pp accuracy drop (83.2% [74.6%, 91.7%] to 55.3% [44.1%, 66.6%]), while GPT-5-mini, Gemini, and Claude maintain high accuracy with modest drops of 8.5pp, 2.4pp, and 5.6pp respectively. Analysis of model-generated reasoning reveals confident explanations for fabricated visual interpretations across all models, suggesting varying degrees of reliance on textual shortcuts versus genuine visual analysis.

Many failures arise from inaccuracies and instability, especially in long-tail scenarios and complex interactions. However, current vision-language models are weak at spatial grounding and understanding, and VLA systems built on them therefore show limited perception and localization ability. To address these challenges, we introduce Percept-WAM, a perception-enhanced World-Awareness-Action Model that is the first to implicitly integrate 2D/3D scene understanding abilities within a single vision-language model (VLM). Instead of relying on QA-style spatial reasoning, Percept-WAM unifies 2D/3D perception tasks into World-PV and World-BEV tokens, which encode both spatial coordinates and confidence. We propose a grid-conditioned prediction mechanism for dense object perception, incorporating IoU-aware scoring and parallel autoregressive decoding, improving stability in long-tail, far-range, and small-object scenarios. Additionally, Percept-WAM leverages pretrained VLM parameters to retain general intelligence (e.g., logical reasoning) and can output perception results and trajectory control outputs directly. Experiments show that Percept-WAM matches or surpasses classical detectors and segmenters on downstream perception benchmarks, achieving 51.7/58.9 mAP on COCO 2D detection and nuScenes BEV 3D detection. When integrated with trajectory decoders, it further improves planning performance on nuScenes and NAVSIM, e.g., surpassing DiffusionDrive by 2.1 in PMDS on NAVSIM.

In this work, we explore how to equip them with a plug-and-play memory that injects useful world knowledge. Motivated by in-context memory in Transformer-based LLMs, we conduct empirical studies to show that DiT can be steered via interventions on its hidden states, and simple low-pass and high-pass filters in the embedding space naturally disentangle low-level appearance and high-level physical/semantic cues, enabling targeted guidance. Building on these observations, we propose a learnable memory encoder DiT-Mem, composed of stacked 3D CNNs, low-/high-pass filters, and self-attention layers. The encoder maps reference videos into a compact set of memory tokens, which are concatenated as the memory within the DiT self-attention layers. During training, we keep the diffusion backbone frozen, and only optimize the memory encoder. It yields a rather efficient training process on few training parameters (150M) and 10K data samples, and enables plug-and-play usage at inference time.

Although recent methods achieve high-fidelity reconstructions, they either rely on costly human annotations for object trajectories or use time-varying representations without explicit object-level decomposition, leading to intertwined static and dynamic elements that hinder scene separation. We present IDSplat, a self-supervised 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that reconstructs dynamic scenes with explicit instance decomposition and learnable motion trajectories, without requiring human annotations. Our key insight is to model dynamic objects as coherent instances undergoing rigid transformations, rather than unstructured time-varying primitives. For instance decomposition, we employ zero-shot, language-grounded video tracking anchored to 3D using lidar, and estimate consistent poses via feature correspondences. We introduce a coordinated-turn smoothing scheme to obtain temporally and physically consistent motion trajectories, mitigating pose misalignments and tracking failures, followed by joint optimization of object poses and Gaussian parameters. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive reconstruction quality while maintaining instance-level decomposition and generalizes across diverse sequences and view densities without retraining, making it practical for large-scale autonomous driving applications.

Using Mitsuba 3 for differentiable rendering, we optimize patch textures across variations in geometry, lighting, and viewpoint, and compare their effectiveness to a 2D compositing baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that 3D-optimized patches achieve high attack success rates, especially in a denial-of-service scenario (empty to full), where success reaches 84.94 percent. Concealment attacks (full to empty) prove more challenging but still reach 30.32 percent.

But do vision-language models (VLMs) can? Recent work demonstrates that even state-of-the-art VLMs still struggle to understand 3D space and long videos, although they are powerful in typical vision-language tasks. Current methods often rely on specialized architectural designs to improve performance for 3D tasks and video understanding tasks separately. In contrast, we propose LAST, short for LeArn to Think in Space and Time, to jointly improve 3D spatial and long video understanding for general VLMs with only a set of 2D images as inputs. LAST makes VLMs think in space and time rather than only with text before giving the final answer, building visual thinking trajectories in 3D space and temporal dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LAST in two scenarios: 1) zero-shot, where we directly prompt proprietary models; and 2) fine-tuning general VLMs with data that include thinking trajectories in 3D space and time. We show that LAST brings substantial gains in various benchmarks, including 3 spatial understanding, 4 video understanding, and 3 image understanding tasks.

These include 1) input-level conflicts, where the conditioning image contradicts the text prompt, and 2) model-bias conflicts, where generative biases disrupt alignment even when conditions match the text. Addressing these conflicts requires nuanced solutions, which standard supervised fine-tuning struggles to provide. Preference-based optimization techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) show promise but are limited by gradient entanglement between text and condition signals and lack disentangled training data for multi-constraint tasks. To overcome this, we propose a bidirectionally decoupled DPO framework (BideDPO). Our method creates two disentangled preference pairs-one for the condition and one for the text-to reduce gradient entanglement. The influence of pairs is managed using an Adaptive Loss Balancing strategy for balanced optimization. We introduce an automated data pipeline to sample model outputs and generate conflict-aware data. This process is embedded in an iterative optimization strategy that refines both the model and the data. We construct a DualAlign benchmark to evaluate conflict resolution between text and condition. Experiments show BideDPO significantly improves text success rates (e.g., +35%) and condition adherence. We also validate our approach using the COCO dataset.

In this work, we propose a novel, theoretically grounded approach that leverages diffusion models to estimate data likelihood via reconstruction deviation induced by partial reverse denoising. Specifically, we establish a formal connection between reconstruction error and data likelihood, grounded in the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of Markovian diffusion processes, thereby enabling a principled, distribution-aware scoring criterion for data selection. Complementarily, we introduce an efficient information-theoretic method to identify the optimal reconstruction timestep, ensuring that the deviation provides a reliable signal indicative of underlying data likelihood. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that reconstruction deviation offers an effective scoring criterion, consistently outperforming existing baselines across selection ratios, and closely matching full-data training using only 50% of the data.

Previous approaches treated an MLLM as a simple encoder, ignoring its generative nature, and under-utilising its compositional reasoning and world knowledge.

The matching stage uses the same MLLM to autoregressively decide relevance from multi-view inputs, including both raw data and its own projected embeddings for each query and document. It provides instance-wise discrimination supervision that complements a standard contrastive loss, offering stronger gradients on hard negatives and preserving the compositional strengths of the original MLLM. To obtain semantically richer multimodal embeddings, we use multiple learnable tokens to augment each input, generating fine-grained contextual, mutually orthogonal embeddings with low inference cost.

Yet, achieving reliable 3D understanding from monocular images requires substantial annotation, and 3D labels are especially costly. To maximize performance under constrained labeling budgets, it is essential to prioritize annotating samples expected to deliver the largest performance gains. This prioritization is the focus of active learning. Curiously, we observed two significant limitations in active learning algorithms for 3D monocular object detection. First, previous approaches select entire images, which is inefficient, as non-informative instances contained in the same image also need to be labeled. Secondly, existing methods rely on uncertainty-based selection, which in monocular 3D object detection creates a bias toward depth ambiguity. Consequently, distant objects are selected, while nearby objects are overlooked.\n  To address these limitations, we propose IDEAL-M3D, the first instance-level pipeline for monocular 3D detection. For the first time, we demonstrate that an explicitly diverse, fast-to-train ensemble improves diversity-driven active learning for monocular 3D. We induce diversity with heterogeneous backbones and task-agnostic features, loss weight perturbation, and time-dependent bagging.

While recent CLIP-inspired methods attempt to leverage textual guidance for detection, they are hindered by inaccurate text descriptions and reliance on manual annotations. To overcome these limitations, we propose DGSPNet, an end-to-end language prompt-driven framework. Our approach integrates dual-granularity semantic prompts: coarse-grained textual priors (e.g., 'infrared image', 'small target') and fine-grained personalized semantic descriptions derived through visual-to-textual mapping within the image space. This design not only facilitates learning fine-grained semantic information but also can inherently leverage language prompts during inference without relying on any annotation requirements. By fully leveraging the precision and conciseness of text descriptions, we further introduce a text-guide channel attention (TGCA) mechanism and text-guide spatial attention (TGSA) mechanism that enhances the model's sensitivity to potential targets across both low- and high-level feature spaces.

To address this, this paper establishes a general threat model and introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing Universality, Transmissibility, and Robustness. Experiments show that existing methods perform well in universality and transmissibility, and exhibit some robustness against common image processing operations, yet still fall short under real-world threat scenarios.

Current video-based methods are predominantly single-view, which impedes comprehensive 3D geometry perception and often results in geometric distortions or unrealistic motion patterns. While 3D HOI approaches can generate dynamically plausible motions, their dependence on high-quality 3D data captured in controlled laboratory settings severely limits their generalization to real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SyncMV4D, the first model that jointly generates synchronized multi-view HOI videos and 4D motions by unifying visual prior, motion dynamics, and multi-view geometry. Our framework features two core innovations: (1) a Multi-view Joint Diffusion (MJD) model that co-generates HOI videos and intermediate motions, and (2) a Diffusion Points Aligner (DPA) that refines the coarse intermediate motion into globally aligned 4D metric point tracks.

Nevertheless, existing reinforcement learning methods still face the problem of low data quality, where data samples cannot elicit diverse responses from MLLMs, thus restricting the exploration scope for MLLM reinforcement learning. Some methods attempt to mitigate this problem by imposing constraints on entropy, but none address it at its root. Therefore, to tackle this problem, this work proposes Syn-GRPO (Synthesis-GRPO), which employs an online data generator to synthesize high-quality training data with diverse responses in GRPO training. Specifically, Syn-GRPO consists of two components: (1) data server; (2) GRPO workflow. The data server synthesizes new samples from existing ones using an image generation model, featuring a decoupled and asynchronous scheme to achieve high generation efficiency. The GRPO workflow provides the data server with the new image descriptions, and it leverages a diversity reward to supervise the MLLM to predict image descriptions for synthesizing samples with diverse responses. Experiment results across three visual perception tasks demonstrate that Syn-GRPO improves the data quality by a large margin, achieving significant superior performance to existing MLLM perception methods, and Syn-GRPO presents promising potential for scaling long-term self-evolving RL.

Manual counting is labor-intensive and error-prone, motivating automation through deep learning techniques. However, training reliable deep learning models requires large amounts of high-quality annotated data, which is difficult and time-consuming to produce manually. Consequently, existing cell-counting datasets are often limited, frequently containing fewer than $500$ images. In this work, we introduce a large-scale annotated dataset comprising $3{,}023$ images from immunocytochemistry experiments related to cellular differentiation, containing over $430{,}000$ manually annotated cell locations. The dataset presents significant challenges: high cell density, overlapping and morphologically diverse cells, a long-tailed distribution of cell count per image, and variation in staining protocols. We benchmark three categories of existing methods: regression-based, crowd-counting, and cell-counting techniques on a test set with cell counts ranging from $10$ to $2{,}126$ cells per image. We also evaluate how the Segment Anything Model (SAM) can be adapted for microscopy cell counting using only dot-annotated datasets. As a case study, we implement a density-map-based adaptation of SAM (SAM-Counter) and report a mean absolute error (MAE) of $22.12$, which outperforms existing approaches (second-best MAE of $27.46$).

This approach avoids the limitations of VAE in the two-stage latent diffusion, offering higher model capacity. Existing pixel diffusion models suffer from slow training and inference, as they usually model both high-frequency signals and low-frequency semantics within a single diffusion transformer (DiT). To pursue a more efficient pixel diffusion paradigm, we propose the frequency-DeCoupled pixel diffusion framework. With the intuition to decouple the generation of high and low frequency components, we leverage a lightweight pixel decoder to generate high-frequency details conditioned on semantic guidance from the DiT. This thus frees the DiT to specialize in modeling low-frequency semantics. In addition, we introduce a frequency-aware flow-matching loss that emphasizes visually salient frequencies while suppressing insignificant ones. Extensive experiments show that DeCo achieves superior performance among pixel diffusion models, attaining FID of 1.62 (256x256) and 2.22 (512x512) on ImageNet, closing the gap with latent diffusion methods.

However, it remains challenging for end-to-end deep learning approaches, as such approaches often overlook spatial and anatomical information that are central to the tumor-node-metastasis system. The tumor stage depends on multiple quantitative criteria, including the tumor size and its proximity to the nearest anatomical structures, and small variations can alter the staging outcome. We propose a medically grounded hybrid pipeline that performs staging by explicitly measuring the tumor's size and distance properties rather than treating it as a pure image classification task. Our method employs specialized encoder-decoder networks to precisely segment the lung and adjacent anatomy, including the lobes, tumor, mediastinum, and diaphragm. Subsequently, we extract the necessary tumor properties, i.e. measure the largest tumor dimension and calculate the distance between the tumor and neighboring anatomical structures by a quantitative analysis of the segmentation masks. Finally, we apply rule-based tumor staging aligned with the medical guidelines. This novel framework has been evaluated on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 91.36%. We report the per-stage F1-scores of 0.93 (T1), 0.89 (T2), 0.96 (T3), and 0.90 (T4), a critical evaluation aspect often omitted in prior literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study that embeds explicit clinical context into tumor stage classification. Unlike standard convolutional neural networks that operate in an uninterpretable \"black box\" manner, our method offers both state-of-the-art performance and transparent decision support.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7ba1\u9053\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u6d4b\u91cf\u80bf\u7624\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u5c5e\u6027\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u80ba\u764c\u5206\u671f\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u7eaf\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Lung-PET-CT-Dx\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523091.36%\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u89c6\u80bf\u7624-\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ed3-\u8f6c\u79fb\u7cfb\u7edf\u6240\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9a\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u80bf\u7624\u5927\u5c0f\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u6700\u8fd1\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u90fd\u53ef\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u5206\u671f\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u5272\u80ba\u90e8\u548c\u90bb\u8fd1\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u80ba\u53f6\u3001\u80bf\u7624\u3001\u7eb5\u9694\u548c\u8188\u808c\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u6a21\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u53d6\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u80bf\u7624\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u6d4b\u91cf\u6700\u5927\u80bf\u7624\u5c3a\u5bf8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80bf\u7624\u4e0e\u90bb\u8fd1\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u671f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728Lung-PET-CT-Dx\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523091.36%\uff0c\u5404\u9636\u6bb5F1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\uff1aT1 0.93\u3001T2 0.89\u3001T3 0.96\u3001T4 0.90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5c06\u663e\u5f0f\u4e34\u5e8a\u80cc\u666f\u5d4c\u5165\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u671f\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53c8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Existing approaches rely on visual similarity or text semantics, lacking explicit modeling of structural properties fundamental to user interface (UI) composition. We present a novel graph-based representation that converts UI screenshots into attributed graphs encoding hierarchical relationships and spatial arrangements, potentially generalizable to document layouts, architectural diagrams, and other structured visual domains. A contrastive graph autoencoder learns embeddings preserving multi-level similarity across visual, structural, and semantic properties. The comprehensive analysis demonstrates that our structural embeddings achieve better discriminative power than state-of-the-art Vision Encoders, representing a fundamental advance in the expressiveness of the UI representation. We implement this representation in UISearch, a multi-modal search framework that combines structural embeddings with semantic search through a composable query language. On 20,396 financial software UIs, UISearch achieves 0.92 Top-5 accuracy with 47.5ms median latency (P95: 124ms), scaling to 20,000+ screens.

Most prior work tackles this challenge by either designing better architectures, loss functions, or data augmentation schemes; and collecting more labeled data. We take a different view, arguing that part of the problem lies in how the background is modeled. Common lesion segmentation collapses all non-lesion pixels into a single \"background\" class, ignoring the rich anatomical context in which lesions appear. In reality, the background is highly heterogeneous-composed of tissues, organs, and other structures that can now be labeled manually or inferred automatically using existing segmentation models.\n  In this paper, we argue that training with fine-grained labels that sub-divide the background class, which we call BackSplit, is a simple yet powerful paradigm that can offer a significant performance boost without increasing inference costs. From an information theoretic standpoint, we prove that BackSplit increases the expected Fisher Information relative to conventional binary training, leading to tighter asymptotic bounds and more stable optimization. With extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures, we empirically show that BackSplit consistently boosts small-lesion segmentation performance, even when auxiliary labels are generated automatically using pretrained segmentation models.

In this work, we investigate whether such capabilities can be harnessed for controllable image-to-video generation by interpreting visual signals embedded within the frames as instructions, a paradigm we term In-Video Instruction. In contrast to prompt-based control, which provides textual descriptions that are inherently global and coarse, In-Video Instruction encodes user guidance directly into the visual domain through elements such as overlaid text, arrows, or trajectories. This enables explicit, spatial-aware, and unambiguous correspondences between visual subjects and their intended actions by assigning distinct instructions to different objects.

This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u610f\u8bc6\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "COVT\u6846\u67b6\u8ba9VLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\uff08\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u7ea620\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u9884\u7b97\u5185\u4ece\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6355\u63492D\u5916\u89c2\u30013D\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u7ed3\u6784\u7b49\u4e92\u8865\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u6765\u91cd\u5efa\u5bc6\u96c6\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7\u5341\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06COVT\u96c6\u6210\u5230Qwen2.5-VL\u548cLLaVA\u7b49\u5f3aVLMs\u4e2d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u53473%\u523016%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u89c9\u601d\u7ef4\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "COVT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, previous generations-including SAM and its successor-still struggle with fine-grained, low-level segmentation challenges such as camouflaged object detection, medical image segmentation, cell image segmentation, and shadow detection. To address these limitations, we originally proposed SAM-Adapter in 2023, demonstrating substantial gains on these difficult scenarios. With the emergence of Segment Anything 3 (SAM3)-a more efficient and higher-performing evolution with a redesigned architecture and improved training pipeline-we revisit these long-standing challenges. In this work, we present SAM3-Adapter, the first adapter framework tailored for SAM3 that unlocks its full segmentation capability. SAM3-Adapter not only reduces computational overhead but also consistently surpasses both SAM and SAM2-based solutions, establishing new state-of-the-art results across multiple downstream tasks, including medical imaging, camouflaged (concealed) object segmentation, and shadow detection. Built upon the modular and composable design philosophy of the original SAM-Adapter, SAM3-Adapter provides stronger generalizability, richer task adaptability, and significantly improved segmentation precision. Extensive experiments confirm that integrating SAM3 with our adapter yields superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency compared to all prior SAM-based adaptations.

However, a key limitation remains: SAM3D cannot reconstruct specific objects referred to by textual descriptions, a capability that is essential for practical applications such as 3D editing, game development, and virtual environments. To address this gap, we introduce Ref-SAM3D, a simple yet effective extension to SAM3D that incorporates textual descriptions as a high-level prior, enabling text-guided 3D reconstruction from a single RGB image. Through extensive qualitative experiments, we show that Ref-SAM3D, guided only by natural language and a single 2D view, delivers competitive and high-fidelity zero-shot reconstruction performance. Our results demonstrate that Ref-SAM3D effectively bridges the gap between 2D visual cues and 3D geometric understanding, offering a more flexible and accessible paradigm for reference-guided 3D reconstruction.

However, existing datasets often simplify task planning by ignoring operations research (OR) knowledge and 3D spatial grounding. In this work, we propose Operations Research knowledge-based 3D Grounded Task Scheduling (ORS3D), a new task that requires the synergy of language understanding, 3D grounding, and efficiency optimization. Unlike prior settings, ORS3D demands that agents minimize total completion time by leveraging parallelizable subtasks, e.g., cleaning the sink while the microwave operates. To facilitate research on ORS3D, we construct ORS3D-60K, a large-scale dataset comprising 60K composite tasks across 4K real-world scenes. Furthermore, we propose GRANT, an embodied multi-modal large language model equipped with a simple yet effective scheduling token mechanism to generate efficient task schedules and grounded actions.

We present Cloud4D, the first learning-based framework that reconstructs a physically consistent, four-dimensional cloud state using only synchronized ground-based cameras.

By tracking the 3D liquid water content retrievals over time, Cloud4D additionally estimates horizontal wind vectors.

We introduce IF-Edit, a tuning-free framework that repurposes pretrained image-to-video diffusion models for instruction-driven image editing. IF-Edit addresses three key challenges: prompt misalignment, redundant temporal latents, and blurry late-stage frames. It includes (1) a chain-of-thought prompt enhancement module that transforms static editing instructions into temporally grounded reasoning prompts; (2) a temporal latent dropout strategy that compresses frame latents after the expert-switch point, accelerating denoising while preserving semantic and temporal coherence; and (3) a self-consistent post-refinement step that sharpens late-stage frames using a short still-video trajectory. Experiments on four public benchmarks, covering non-rigid editing, physical and temporal reasoning, and general instruction edits, show that IF-Edit performs strongly on reasoning-centric tasks while remaining competitive on general-purpose edits.

However, extracting effective features outside the in-distribution (ID) boundary in latent space remains challenging due to the difficulty of identifying decision boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a novel framework called Boundary-based Out-Of-Distribution data generation (BOOD), which synthesizes high-quality OOD features and generates human-compatible outlier images using diffusion models. BOOD first learns a text-conditioned latent feature space from the ID dataset, selects ID features closest to the decision boundary, and perturbs them to cross the decision boundary to form OOD features. These synthetic OOD features are then decoded into images in pixel space by a diffusion model. Compared to previous works, BOOD provides a more training efficient strategy for synthesizing informative OOD features, facilitating clearer distinctions between ID and OOD data. Extensive experimental results on common benchmarks demonstrate that BOOD surpasses the state-of-the-art method significantly, achieving a 29.64% decrease in average FPR95 (40.31% vs. 10.67%) and a 7.27% improvement in average AUROC (90.15% vs. 97.42%) on the CIFAR-100 dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "BOOD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u8fb9\u754c\u5916\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6709\u6548\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u9760\u8fd1\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u7684ID\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6270\u52a8\u4f7f\u5176\u8de8\u8d8a\u8fb9\u754c\u5f62\u6210OOD\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFPR95\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e29.64%(40.31% vs 10.67%)\uff0cAUROC\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53477.27%(90.15% vs 97.42%)\u3002", "conclusion": "BOOD\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5408\u6210\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684OOD\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u5730\u533a\u5206ID\u548cOOD\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

Recent advances in computer vision have produced highly accurate deep learning-based object trackers, but these models are typically too heavy in computation and memory for wearable AR devices. In this paper, we present a lightweight RGB object tracking algorithm designed specifically for resource-constrained AR platforms. The proposed tracker employs a compact Siamese neural network architecture and incorporates optimization techniques such as model pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation to drastically reduce model size and inference cost while maintaining high tracking accuracy. We train the tracker offline on large video datasets using deep convolutional neural networks and then deploy it on-device for real-time tracking. Experimental results on standard tracking benchmarks show that our approach achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art trackers, yet runs in real-time on a mobile AR headset at around 30 FPS -- more than an order of magnitude faster than prior high-performance trackers on the same hardware.

Extending such models to brain signals could deepen our understanding of human perception and mental representations. However,electroencephalography (EEG) presents major challenges for image generation due to high noise, low spatial resolution, and strong inter-subject variability. Existing approaches,such as DreamDiffusion, BrainVis, and GWIT, primarily adapt EEG features to pre-trained Stable Diffusion models using complex alignment or classification pipelines, often resulting in large parameter counts and limited interpretability. We introduce SYNAPSE, a two-stage framework that bridges EEG signal representation learning and high-fidelity image synthesis. In Stage1, a CLIP-aligned EEG autoencoder learns a semantically structured latent representation by combining signal reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. In Stage2, the pretrained encoder is frozen and integrated with a lightweight adaptation of Stable Diffusion, enabling efficient conditioning on EEG features with minimal trainable parameters. Our method achieves a semantically coherent latent space and state-of-the-art perceptual fidelity on the CVPR40 dataset, outperforming prior EEG-to-image models in both reconstruction efficiency and image quality. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that SYNAPSE generalizes effectively across subjects, preserving visual semantics even when class-level agreement is reduced.

The model achieved strong performance for S-Like and Periodic classes, with ROC area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.95 and 0.99, and Precision-Recall AUC values of 0.98 and 0.89, respectively. However, performance was significantly lower for Fast and Long classes (ROC AUC of 0.68 for Long class), and the model exhibited difficulty distinguishing between Periodic and Non-Periodic objects. Evaluation on partial light curve data (5, 10,and 20 days from detection) revealed substantial performance degradation, with increased misclassification toward the S-Like class.

Extensive experiments on static (e.g., ImageNet) and neuromorphic (e.g., CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate that our TaWQ maintains high energy efficiency (4.12M, 0.63mJ) while incurring a negligible quantization loss of only 0.22% on ImageNet.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTemporal-adaptive Weight Quantization (TaWQ)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u8d85\u4f4e\u4f4d\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u4ea7\u751f0.22%\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u661f\u5f62\u80f6\u8d28\u7ec6\u80de\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u7a81\u89e6\u8c03\u8282\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3SNN\u4e2d\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTaWQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6cbf\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u8d85\u4f4e\u4f4d\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9759\u6001(ImageNet)\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001(CIFAR10-DVS)\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTaWQ\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548(4.12M, 0.63mJ)\uff0c\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\u4ec5\u4ea7\u751f0.22%\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "TaWQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, each model nesting and data conversion may cause information loss, and it is necessary to streamline the tools to facilitate architects and users to participate in the design. Therefore, this study hopes to prove that I2I GAN also has the potential to recognize topological relationships autonomously. Therefore, this research proposes a method for quickly detecting the ability of pix2pix to learn topological relationships, which is achieved by adding two Grasshopper-based detection modules before and after GAN. At the same time, quantitative data is provided and its learning process is visualized, and changes in different input modes such as greyscale and RGB affect its learning efficiency. There are two innovations in this paper: 1) It proves that pix2pix can automatically learn spatial topological relationships and apply them to architectural design. 2) It fills the gap in detecting the performance of Image-based Generation GAN from a topological perspective.

The two detection modules can be widely used for customizing image datasets with the same topological structure and for batch detection of topological relationships of images.

However, integrating these sources into coherent spatial models for planning and prediction remains a major challenge. Existing agent-centric methods often rely on direct environmental sensing, limiting scalability and raising privacy concerns. This paper introduces CubeletWorld, a novel framework for representing and analyzing urban environments through a discretized 3D grid of spatial units called cubelets. This abstraction enables privacy-preserving modeling by embedding diverse data signals, such as infrastructure, movement, or environmental indicators, into localized cubelet states. CubeletWorld supports downstream tasks such as planning, navigation, and occupancy prediction without requiring agent-driven sensing. To evaluate this paradigm, we propose the CubeletWorld State Prediction task, which involves predicting the cubelet state using a realistic dataset containing various urban elements like streets and buildings through this discretized representation. We explore a range of modified core models suitable for our setting and analyze challenges posed by increasing spatial granularity, specifically the issue of sparsity in representation and scalability of baselines. In contrast to existing 3D occupancy prediction models, our cubelet-centric approach focuses on inferring state at the spatial unit level, enabling greater generalizability across regions and improved privacy compliance. Our results demonstrate that CubeletWorld offers a flexible and extensible framework for learning from complex urban data, and it opens up new possibilities for scalable simulation and decision support in domains such as socio-demographic modeling, environmental monitoring, and emergency response.

Vision loss associated with RNV is preventable with timely intervention, making RNV clinical screening and monitoring a priority. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography (OCTA) provides high-resolution imaging and high-sensitivity detection of RNV lesions. With recent commercial devices introducing widefield OCTA imaging to the clinic, the technology stands to improve early detection of RNV pathology. However, to meet clinical requirements these imaging capabilities must be combined with effective RNV detection and quantification, but existing algorithms for OCTA images are optimized for conventional, i.e. narrow, fields of view. Here, we present a novel approach for RNV diagnosis and staging on widefield OCT/OCTA. Unlike conventional methods dependent on multi-layer retinal segmentation, our model reframes RNV identification as a direct binary localization task. Our fully automated approach was trained and validated on 589 widefield scans (17x17-mm to 26x21-mm) collected from multiple devices at multiple clinics. Our method achieved a device-dependent area under curve (AUC) ranging from 0.96 to 0.99 for RNV diagnosis, and mean intersection over union (IOU) ranging from 0.76 to 0.88 for segmentation.

Data-driven methods are widely used, but they often overlook physical principles, leading to unrealistic spectra, particularly in atmosphere-affected bands. To address this challenge, we propose the Spectral Super-Resolution Neural Operator (SSRNO), which incorporates atmospheric radiative transfer (ART) prior into the data-driven procedure, yielding more physically consistent predictions. The proposed SSRNO framework consists of three stages: upsampling, reconstruction, and refinement. In the upsampling stage, we leverage prior information to expand the input multispectral image, producing a physically plausible hyperspectral estimate. Subsequently, we utilize a neural operator in the reconstruction stage to learn a continuous mapping across the spectral domain. Finally, the refinement stage imposes a hard constraint on the output HSI to eliminate color distortion. The upsampling and refinement stages are implemented via the proposed guidance matrix projection (GMP) method, and the reconstruction neural operator adopts U-shaped spectral-aware convolution (SAC) layers to capture multi-scale features. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate the optimality of the GMP method. With the neural operator and ART priors, SSRNO also achieves continuous spectral reconstruction and zero-shot extrapolation.

However, standardized benchmarks for evaluating these capabilities in real-world settings, and in direct comparison to humans, remain scarce. Existing evaluations often rely on pre-collected human motion datasets or simulation-based experiments, which limit reproducibility, overlook hardware factors, and hinder fair human-robot comparisons. We present Switch-JustDance, a low-cost and reproducible benchmarking pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games, Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch, to evaluate robot whole-body control. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a representative platform, Switch-JustDance converts in-game choreography into robot-executable motions through streaming, motion reconstruction, and motion retargeting modules and enables users to evaluate controller performance through the game's built-in scoring system.

Class Imbalance (CI) remains a fundamental challenge in FL, where rare but critical classes are often severely underrepresented in individual client datasets. Although prior work has addressed CI during training through reliable aggregation and local class distribution alignment, these methods typically rely on access to labeled data or coordination among clients, and none address class unsupervised adaptation to dynamic domains or distribution shifts at inference time under federated CI constraints. Revealing the failure of state-of-the-art TTA in federated client adaptation in CI scenario, we propose pFedBBN,a personalized federated test-time adaptation framework that employs balanced batch normalization (BBN) during local client adaptation to mitigate prediction bias by treating all classes equally, while also enabling client collaboration guided by BBN similarity, ensuring that clients with similar balanced representations reinforce each other and that adaptation remains aligned with domain-specific characteristics. pFedBBN supports fully unsupervised local adaptation and introduces a class-aware model aggregation strategy that enables personalized inference without compromising privacy. It addresses both distribution shifts and class imbalance through balanced feature normalization and domain-aware collaboration, without requiring any labeled or raw data from clients.

We study ObAct on a dual-arm robotic system equipped with wrist-mounted cameras. At test time, ObAct dynamically assigns observer and actor roles: the observer arm constructs a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation from three images, virtually explores this to find an optimal camera pose, then moves to this pose; the actor arm then executes a policy using the observer's observations. This formulation enhances the clarity and visibility of both the object and the gripper in the policy's observations. As a result, we enable the training of ambidextrous policies on observations that remain closer to the occlusion-free training distribution, leading to more robust policies. We study this formulation with two existing imitation learning methods -- trajectory transfer and behavior cloning -- and experiments show that ObAct significantly outperforms static-camera setups: trajectory transfer improves by 145% without occlusion and 233% with occlusion, while behavior cloning improves by 75% and 143%, respectively.

Accurate prediction enables realistic simulation and strategic understanding of gameplay evolution. Most existing models are evaluated solely on per-agent accuracy metrics (minADE, minFDE), which assess each agent independently on its best-of-k prediction. However these metrics overlook whether the model learns which predicted trajectories can jointly form a plausible multi-agent future. Many state-of-the-art models are designed and optimized primarily based on these metrics. As a result, they may underperform on joint predictions and also fail to generate coherent, interpretable multi-agent scenarios in team sports.

In this work, we study TabPFN through the lens of signal reconstruction and provide the first frequency-based analysis of its in-context learning behavior. We show that TabPFN possesses a broader effective frequency capacity than standard ReLU-MLPs, even without hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, unlike MLPs whose spectra evolve primarily over training epochs, we find that TabPFN's spectral capacity adapts directly to the number of samples provided in-context, a phenomenon we term Spectral Adaptivity. We further demonstrate that positional encoding modulates TabPFN's frequency response, mirroring classical results in implicit neural representations. Finally, we show that these properties enable TabPFN to perform training-free and hyperparameter-free image denoising, illustrating its potential as a task-agnostic implicit model.

ST quantifies the expression of tens of thousands of genes in a tissue section; however, heavy observational noise is often introduced during measurement. In prior studies, to ensure meaningful assessment, both training and evaluation have been restricted to only a small subset of highly variable genes, and genes outside this subset have also been excluded from the training process. However, since there are likely co-expression relationships between genes, low-expression genes may still contribute to the estimation of the evaluation target. In this paper, we propose $Auxiliary \\ Gene \\ Learning$ (AGL) that utilizes the benefit of the ignored genes by reformulating their expression estimation as auxiliary tasks and training them jointly with the primary tasks. To effectively leverage auxiliary genes, we must select a subset of auxiliary genes that positively influence the prediction of the target genes. However, this is a challenging optimization problem due to the vast number of possible combinations. To overcome this challenge, we propose Prior-Knowledge-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Gene Selection via Bi-level Optimization (DkGSB), a method that ranks genes by leveraging prior knowledge and relaxes the combinatorial selection problem into a differentiable top-$k$ selection problem. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of incorporating auxiliary genes and show that the proposed method outperforms conventional auxiliary task learning approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAGL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5ffd\u7565\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u4e0e\u4e3b\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8f85\u52a9\u57fa\u56e0\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86DkGSB\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u5fae\u7684top-k\u57fa\u56e0\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66(ST)\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u53d8\u5f02\u57fa\u56e0\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u57fa\u56e0\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5171\u8868\u8fbe\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f4e\u8868\u8fbe\u57fa\u56e0\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u57fa\u56e0\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ecd\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002", "method": "AGL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5ffd\u7565\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e3b\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8f85\u52a9\u57fa\u56e0\u9009\u62e9\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDkGSB\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u57fa\u56e0\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u5c06\u7ec4\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u677e\u5f1b\u4e3a\u53ef\u5fae\u7684top-k\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6574\u5408\u8f85\u52a9\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u7406\u9009\u62e9\u8f85\u52a9\u57fa\u56e0\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The most challenging search and rescue missions involve difficult-to-access terrains, such as dense forests with high occlusion. Deploying unmanned aerial vehicles for exploration can significantly enhance search effectiveness, facilitate access to challenging environments, and reduce search time. However, in dense forests, the effectiveness of unmanned aerial vehicles depends on their ability to capture clear views of the ground, necessitating a robust search strategy to optimize camera positioning and perspective. This work presents an optimized planning strategy and an efficient algorithm for the next best view problem in occluded environments. Two novel optimization heuristics, a geometry heuristic, and a visibility heuristic, are proposed to enhance search performance by selecting optimal camera viewpoints. Comparative evaluations in both simulated and real-world settings reveal that the visibility heuristic achieves greater performance, identifying over 90% of hidden objects in simulated forests and offering 10% better detection rates than the geometry heuristic. Additionally, real-world experiments demonstrate that the visibility heuristic provides better coverage under the canopy, highlighting its potential for improving search and rescue missions in occluded environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u906e\u6321\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u641c\u7d22\u6551\u63f4\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u4f73\u89c6\u89d2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u68ee\u6797\u7b49\u906e\u6321\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u641c\u6551\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u6355\u6349\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u5730\u9762\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u906e\u6321\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u51e0\u4f55\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u906e\u6321\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u89c6\u89d2\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u68ee\u6797\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u6bd4\u51e0\u4f55\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u9ad810%\u3002\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5728\u6811\u51a0\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5728\u906e\u6321\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u641c\u6551\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u68ee\u6797\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We compare three inference paradigms for hierarchical VQA and find that stepwise reasoning, when conditioned on prior answers, significantly outperforms single-pass prompting. Further analysis indicates that the main limitation of current VLMs is their inability to maintain cross-level state, rather than a lack of taxonomic knowledge. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose Self-Elicited Knowledge Distillation (SEKD), which requires no human labels or external tools: the same VLM is prompted to reason step by step and act as a teacher by exposing its hard labels, soft distributions, and decoder hidden states, while a single-pass student distills these signals. The student VLM remains efficient while approaching the accuracy of its multi-step teacher. It improves in-domain path consistency (HCA) by up to +29.50 percentage points, raises zero-shot HCA on an unseen taxonomy from 4.15% to 42.26%, and yields gains on challenging mathematical benchmarks.

Ultrasound heads predict Graf alpha, beta, and femoral head coverage; X-ray heads predict acetabular index (AI), center-edge (CE) angle and IHDI grade. On our held out labeled evaluation set, ultrasound measurement error is modest (e.g., alpha MAE ~= 9.7 degrees, coverage MAE ~= 14.0%), while radiographic probes achieve AI and CE MAEs of ~= 7.6 degrees and ~= 8.9 degrees, respectively. The calibrated US-only policy is explored across rule families (alpha-only; alpha OR coverage; alpha AND coverage), uncertainty inflation factors, and per-utility trade-offs using decision-curve analysis. Conservative settings yield high coverage with near-zero US-only rates; permissive settings (e.g., alpha OR coverage at larger deltas) achieve non-zero US-only throughput with expected coverage tradeoffs.

To address these challenges, we propose SloMo-Fast, a source-free, dual-teacher CTTA framework designed for enhanced adaptability and generalization. It includes two complementary teachers: the Slow-Teacher, which exhibits slow forgetting and retains long-term knowledge of previously encountered domains to ensure robust generalization, and the Fast-Teacher rapidly adapts to new domains while accumulating and integrating knowledge across them. This framework preserves knowledge of past domains and adapts efficiently to new ones. We also introduce Cyclic Test-Time Adaptation (Cyclic-TTA), a novel CTTA benchmark that simulates recurring domain shifts. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SloMo-Fast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across Cyclic-TTA, as well as ten other CTTA settings, highlighting its ability to both adapt and generalize across evolving and revisited domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSloMo-Fast\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u6301\u7eed\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6162\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u5feb\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u671f\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CTTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u6216\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9002\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u957f\u671f\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u5148\u524d\u9047\u5230\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "SloMo-Fast\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6162\u6559\u5e08\u7f13\u6162\u9057\u5fd8\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u957f\u671f\u77e5\u8bc6\u786e\u4fdd\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5feb\u6559\u5e08\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u57df\u5e76\u79ef\u7d2f\u8de8\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Cyclic-TTA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5faa\u73af\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728Cyclic-TTA\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5341\u4e2aCTTA\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cSloMo-Fast\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5728\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u91cd\u8bbf\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SloMo-Fast\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86CTTA\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We propose Shape-Adapting Gated Experts (SAGE), an input-adaptive framework that enables dynamic expert routing in heterogeneous visual networks. SAGE reconfigures static backbones into dynamically routed expert architectures. SAGE's dual-path design features a backbone stream that preserves representation and selectively activates an expert path through hierarchical gating. This gating mechanism operates at multiple hierarchical levels, performing a two-level, hierarchical selection between shared and specialized experts to modulate model logits for Top-K activation. Our Shape-Adapting Hub (SA-Hub) harmonizes structural and semantic representations across the CNN and the Transformer module, effectively bridging diverse modules.

Non-sampling frameworks like Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) offer an efficient alternative, but suffer from severe training instability and hypothesis collapse, which has historically hindered their performance. This problem is dramatically exacerbated when attempting to combine them with modern, efficient MLP-based backbones. To resolve this fundamental incompatibility, we propose TimePre, a novel framework that successfully unifies the efficiency of MLP-based models with the distributional flexibility of the MCL paradigm. The core of our solution is Stabilized Instance Normalization (SIN), a novel normalization layer that explicitly remedies this incompatibility. SIN stabilizes the hybrid architecture by correcting channel-wise statistical shifts, definitively resolving the catastrophic hypothesis collapse. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimePre achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on key probabilistic metrics. Critically, TimePre achieves inference speeds orders of magnitude faster than sampling-based models and, unlike prior MCL work, demonstrates stable performance scaling. It thus bridges the long-standing gap between accuracy, efficiency, and stability in probabilistic forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "TimePre\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6982\u7387\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316(SIN)\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MLP\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u591a\u9009\u62e9\u5b66\u4e60(MCL)\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6982\u7387\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u91c7\u6837\u7684MCL\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548MLP\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u52a0\u4e25\u91cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTimePre\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316(SIN)\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6b63\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u79fb\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5f7b\u5e95\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTimePre\u5728\u5173\u952e\u6982\u7387\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "TimePre\u5728\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Although saliency regularization has emerged as a promising way to achieve this, existing approaches typically require costly supervision such as human gaze data or manual saliency annotations. In contrast, AutoFocus-IL leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to automatically identify and track key objects in demonstrations, generating temporal saliency maps that highlight causal visual signals while suppressing distractors. These maps are then used to regularize behavior cloning policies, yielding stronger alignment between visual attention and task-relevant cues. Experiments in both the CARLA simulator and real-robot manipulation tasks demonstrate that AutoFocus-IL not only outperforms standard behavior cloning but also surpasses state-of-the-art baselines that assume privileged access to human supervision, such as gaze data.

Compared to 3D representations like voxels and point clouds, mesh-based representations are preferred as they enable the application of differential geometry theory and are optimized for modern graphics pipelines. However, existing inverse rendering methods often fail catastrophically on high-genus surfaces, leading to the loss of key topological features, and tend to oversmooth low-genus surfaces, resulting in the loss of surface details. This failure stems from their overreliance on Adam-based optimizers, which can lead to vanishing and exploding gradients. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an adaptive V-cycle remeshing scheme in conjunction with a re-parametrized Adam optimizer to enhance topological and geometric awareness. By periodically coarsening and refining the deforming mesh, our method informs mesh vertices of their current topology and geometry before optimization, mitigating gradient issues while preserving essential topological features. Additionally, we enforce topological consistency by constructing topological primitives with genus numbers that match those of ground truth using Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Experimental results demonstrate that our inverse rendering approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art method, achieving significant improvements in Chamfer Distance and Volume IoU, particularly for high-genus surfaces, while also enhancing surface details for low-genus surfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u4e8f\u683c\u8868\u9762\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94V\u5faa\u73af\u91cd\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684Adam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u4e8f\u683c\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u4e8f\u683c\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u7ecf\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u952e\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u4e8f\u683c\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u5219\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u9762\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9Adam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u548c\u7206\u70b8\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94V\u5faa\u73af\u91cd\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u7ed3\u5408\u91cd\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684Adam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7c97\u5316\u548c\u7ec6\u5316\u53d8\u5f62\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u524d\u544a\u77e5\u7f51\u683c\u9876\u70b9\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528Gauss-Bonnet\u5b9a\u7406\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\u4e8f\u683c\u6570\u5339\u914d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u57fa\u5143\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u62d3\u6251\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u4f53\u79efIoU\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u4e8f\u683c\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4f4e\u4e8f\u683c\u8868\u9762\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u4e8f\u683c\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

There has been increasing demand to perform this process at the boarding gate to minimise the downtime of the aircraft and automating this process is desired to reduce the reliance on human labour. Automating this typically requires estimating a camera's pose with respect to the aircraft for initialisation but most existing localisation methods require infrastructure, which is very challenging in uncontrolled outdoor environments and within the limited turnover time (approximately 2 hours) on an airport tarmac. Additionally, many airlines and airports do not allow contact with the aircraft's surface or using UAVs for inspection between flights, and restrict access to commercial aircraft. Hence, this paper proposes an on-site method that is infrastructure-free and easy to deploy for estimating a pan-tilt-zoom camera's pose and localising scan images. This method initialises using the same pan-tilt-zoom camera used for the inspection task by utilising a Deep Convolutional Neural Network fine-tuned on only synthetic images to predict its own pose. We apply domain randomisation to generate the dataset for fine-tuning the network and modify its loss function by leveraging aircraft geometry to improve accuracy. We also propose a workflow for initialisation, scan path planning, and precise localisation of images captured from a pan-tilt-zoom camera. We evaluate and demonstrate our approach through experiments with real aircraft, achieving root-mean-square camera pose estimation errors of less than 0.24 m and 2 degrees for all real scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u73b0\u573a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1PTZ\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u5e76\u5b9a\u4f4d\u626b\u63cf\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u98de\u673a\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c0f\u4e8e0.24\u7c73\u548c2\u5ea6\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u5546\u7528\u98de\u673a\u5916\u90e8\u76ee\u89c6\u68c0\u67e5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4eba\u529b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u4e0d\u53d7\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5ba4\u5916\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5468\u8f6c\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8bb8\u591a\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u4e0d\u5141\u8bb8\u63a5\u89e6\u98de\u673a\u8868\u9762\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u67e5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u540c\u4e00PTZ\u76f8\u673a\u8fdb\u884c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u81ea\u8eab\u59ff\u6001\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u98de\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\u6539\u8fdb\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u626b\u63cf\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u98de\u673a\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\u5747\u5c0f\u4e8e0.24\u7c73\u548c2\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u98de\u673a\u5916\u90e8\u68c0\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u673a\u573a\u505c\u673a\u576a\u6709\u9650\u5468\u8f6c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we introduce GRIT-LP, a graph transformer explicitly designed for polar ice-layer thickness estimation from polar radar imagery. Accurately estimating ice layer thickness is critical for understanding snow accumulation, reconstructing past climate patterns and reducing uncertainties in projections of future ice sheet evolution and sea level rise. GRIT-LP combines an inductive geometric graph learning framework with self-attention mechanism, and introduces two major innovations that jointly address challenges in modeling the spatio-temporal patterns of ice layers: a partitioned spatial graph construction strategy that forms overlapping, fully connected local neighborhoods to preserve spatial coherence and suppress noise from irrelevant long-range links, and a long-range skip connection mechanism within the transformer that improves information flow and mitigates oversmoothing in deeper attention layers. We conducted extensive experiments, demonstrating that GRIT-LP outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with a 24.92\\% improvement in root mean squared error.

A common solution is to turn large motion into small motion by downsampling video frames during motion estimation. However, determining the optimal downsampling factor typically requires costly rate-distortion optimization. This work introduces lightweight classifiers to predict downsampling factors. These classifiers leverage simple state signals from current and reference frames to balance rate-distortion performance with computational cost. Three variants are proposed: (1) a binary classifier (Bi-Class) trained with Focal Loss to choose between high and low resolutions, (2) a multi-class classifier (Mu-Class) trained with novel soft labels based on rate-distortion costs, and (3) a co-class approach (Co-Class) that combines the predictive capability of the multi-class classifier with the selective search of the binary classifier.

Although existing methods address this issue by adjusting logits based on the estimated class distribution of unlabeled data, they often handle model imbalance in a coarse-grained manner, conflating data imbalance with bias arising from varying class-specific learning difficulties. To address this issue, we propose a unified framework, SC-SSL, which suppresses model bias through decoupled sampling control. During training, we identify the key variables for sampling control under ideal conditions. By introducing a classifier with explicit expansion capability and adaptively adjusting sampling probabilities across different data distributions, SC-SSL mitigates feature-level imbalance for minority classes. In the inference phase, we further analyze the weight imbalance of the linear classifier and apply post-hoc sampling control with an optimization bias vector to directly calibrate the logits.

Existing pipelines rely on incompatible assumptions: static and in-the-wild methods enforce a single geometry, while dynamic ones assume smooth motion, both failing under long-term, discontinuous changes. To solve this problem, we introduce ChronoGS, a temporally modulated Gaussian representation that reconstructs all periods within a unified anchor scaffold. It's also designed to disentangle stable and evolving components, achieving temporally consistent reconstruction of multi-period scenes.

We introduce PrismAudio, the first framework to integrate Reinforcement Learning into V2A generation with specialized Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning. Our approach decomposes monolithic reasoning into four specialized CoT modules (Semantic, Temporal, Aesthetic, and Spatial CoT), each paired with targeted reward functions. This CoT-reward correspondence enables multidimensional RL optimization that guides the model to jointly generate better reasoning across all perspectives, solving the objective entanglement problem while preserving interpretability. To make this optimization computationally practical, we propose Fast-GRPO, which employs hybrid ODE-SDE sampling that dramatically reduces the training overhead compared to existing GRPO implementations. We also introduce AudioCanvas, a rigorous benchmark that is more distributionally balanced and covers more realistically diverse and challenging scenarios than existing datasets, with 300 single-event classes and 501 multi-event samples.

One representative fine-tuning method is to exploit adapter (termed AdapterGNN) which aims to 'augment' the pre-trained model by inserting a lightweight module to make the 'augmented' model better adapt to the downstream tasks. However, graph data may contain various types of noise in downstream tasks, such as noisy edges and ambiguous node attributes. Existing AdapterGNNs are often prone to graph noise and exhibit limited generalizability. How to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of GNNs' fine tuning remains an open problem. In this paper, we show that the above problem can be well addressed by integrating uncertainty learning into the GNN adapter. We propose the Uncertainty-aware Adapter (UAdapterGNN) that fortifies pre-trained GNN models against noisy graph data in the fine-tuning process. Specifically, in contrast to regular AdapterGNN, our UAdapterGNN exploits Gaussian probabilistic adapter to augment the pre-trained GNN model. In this way, when the graph contains various noises,our method can automatically absorb the effects of changes in the variances of the Gaussian distribution, thereby significantly enhancing the model's robustness. Also, UAdapterGNN can further improve the generalization ability of the model on the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and high generalization ability of the proposed UAdapterGNN method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUAdapterGNN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u5230GNN\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3GNN\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AdapterGNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5404\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u5982\u566a\u58f0\u8fb9\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u589e\u5f3aGNN\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6982\u7387\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3GNN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f53\u56fe\u5305\u542b\u5404\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u5438\u6536\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u65b9\u5dee\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86UAdapterGNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u96c6\u6210\u5230GNN\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3GNN\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, HD map-dependent models suffer from costly data acquisition, delayed updates, and vulnerability to corrupted inputs, causing prediction failures. Map-free approaches lack global context, with pairwise attention over-amplifying straight patterns while suppressing transitional patterns, resulting in motion-intention misalignment. This paper proposes GContextFormer, a plug-and-play encoder-decoder architecture with global context-aware hybrid attention and scaled additive aggregation achieving intention-aligned multimodal prediction without map reliance. The Motion-Aware Encoder builds scene-level intention prior via bounded scaled additive aggregation over mode-embedded trajectory tokens and refines per-mode representations under shared global context, mitigating inter-mode suppression and promoting intention alignment. The Hierarchical Interaction Decoder decomposes social reasoning into dual-pathway cross-attention: a standard pathway ensures uniform geometric coverage over agent-mode pairs while a neighbor-context-enhanced pathway emphasizes salient interactions, with gating module mediating their contributions to maintain coverage-focus balance. Experiments on eight highway-ramp scenarios from TOD-VT dataset show GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to existing transformer models, GContextFormer achieves greater robustness and concentrated improvements in high-curvature and transition zones via spatial distributions. Interpretability is achieved through motion mode distinctions and neighbor context modulation exposing reasoning attribution. The modular architecture supports extensibility toward cross-domain multimodal reasoning tasks.

However, the significant computational overhead of processing redundant visual tokens remains a critical bottleneck for real-time robotic deployment. While standard token pruning techniques can alleviate this, these task-agnostic methods struggle to preserve task-critical visual information. To address this challenge, simultaneously preserving both the holistic context and fine-grained details for precise action, we propose Compressor-VLA, a novel hybrid instruction-conditioned token compression framework designed for efficient, task-oriented compression of visual information in VLA models. The proposed Compressor-VLA framework consists of two token compression modules: a Semantic Task Compressor (STC) that distills holistic, task-relevant context, and a Spatial Refinement Compressor (SRC) that preserves fine-grained spatial details. This compression is dynamically modulated by the natural language instruction, allowing for the adaptive condensation of task-relevant visual information. Experimentally, extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compressor-VLA achieves a competitive success rate on the LIBERO benchmark while reducing FLOPs by 59% and the visual token count by over 3x compared to its baseline. The real-robot deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the model's sim-to-real transferability and practical applicability. Moreover, qualitative analyses reveal that our instruction guidance dynamically steers the model's perceptual focus toward task-relevant objects, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCompressor-VLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u4ee4\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c6\u89c9token\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5177\u8eabAI\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684token\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u6761\u4ef6token\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff08\u63d0\u53d6\u6574\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff08\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u538b\u7f29\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728LIBERO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0cFLOPs\u51cf\u5c1159%\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9token\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u8fc73\u500d\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u90e8\u7f72\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Compressor-VLA\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u6307\u4ee4\u5f15\u5bfc\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u611f\u77e5\u7126\u70b9\u5230\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002"}}

However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step. Specifically, the AVA module uses the recurrent state to compute the soft weights to actively process task-relevant visual tokens based on its historical context.

Therefore, it is of great importance to develop an effective and generalizable method for multi-modal deepfake detection. Typically, the audio-visual correlation learning could expose subtle cross-modal inconsistencies, e.g., audio-visual misalignment, which serve as crucial clues in deepfake detection. In this paper, we reformulate the correlation learning with variational Bayesian estimation, where audio-visual correlation is approximated as a Gaussian distributed latent variable, and thus develop a novel framework for deepfake detection, i.e., Forgery-aware Audio-Visual Adaptation with Variational Bayes (FoVB). Specifically, given the prior knowledge of pre-trained backbones, we adopt two core designs to estimate audio-visual correlations effectively. First, we exploit various difference convolutions and a high-pass filter to discern local and global forgery traces from both modalities. Second, with the extracted forgery-aware features, we estimate the latent Gaussian variable of audio-visual correlation via variational Bayes. Then, we factorize the variable into modality-specific and correlation-specific ones with orthogonality constraint, allowing them to better learn intra-modal and cross-modal forgery traces with less entanglement.

This work presents an embedded system that integrates deep learning-based tracking with beamforming to achieve precise sound source localization and directional audio capture in dynamic environments.

A planar concentric circular microphone array constructed with MEMS microphones provides a compact, energy-efficient platform supporting 2D beam steering across azimuth and elevation.

However, UMMs still exhibit a fundamental inconsistency: understanding favors compact embeddings, whereas generation favors reconstruction-rich representations. This structural trade-off produces misaligned decision boundaries, degraded cross-modal coherence, and heightened vulnerability under distributional and adversarial shifts. In this paper, we present UniGame, a self-adversarial post-training framework that directly targets the inconsistencies. By applying a lightweight perturber at the shared token interface, UniGame enables the generation branch to actively seek and challenge fragile understanding, turning the model itself into its own adversary. Experiments demonstrate that UniGame significantly improves the consistency (+4.6%). Moreover, it also achieves substantial improvements in understanding (+3.6%), generation (+0.02), out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness (+4.8% and +6.2% on NaturalBench and AdVQA). The framework is architecture-agnostic, introduces less than 1% additional parameters, and is complementary to existing post-training methods. These results position adversarial self-play as a general and effective principle for enhancing the coherence, stability, and unified competence of future multimodal foundation models.

To accelerate this, flow maps can be distilled from pre-trained teachers, a procedure that conventionally requires sampling from an external dataset. We argue that this data-dependency introduces a fundamental risk of Teacher-Data Mismatch, as a static dataset may provide an incomplete or even misaligned representation of the teacher's full generative capabilities. This leads us to question whether this reliance on data is truly necessary for successful flow map distillation. In this work, we explore a data-free alternative that samples only from the prior distribution, a distribution the teacher is guaranteed to follow by construction, thereby circumventing the mismatch risk entirely. To demonstrate the practical viability of this philosophy, we introduce a principled framework that learns to predict the teacher's sampling path while actively correcting for its own compounding errors to ensure high fidelity. Our approach surpasses all data-based counterparts and establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin. Specifically, distilling from SiT-XL/2+REPA, our method reaches an impressive FID of 1.45 on ImageNet 256x256, and 1.49 on ImageNet 512x512, both with only 1 sampling step.

Our empirical study reveals an inherent trade-off: longer horizons provide stronger global foresight but degrade fine-grained accuracy, while shorter ones sharpen local control yet struggle on long-term tasks, implying fixed choice of single horizons being suboptimal. To mitigate the trade-off, we propose a $\\textbf{mixture of horizons (MoH)}$ strategy. MoH rearranges the action chunk into several segments with different horizons, processes them in parallel with a shared action transformer, and fuses outputs with a light linear gate. It has three appealing benefits. 1) MoH exploits long-term foresight and short-term precision jointly within a single model, improving both performance and generalizability to complex tasks. 2) MoH is plug-and-play for full-attention action modules with minimal training or inference overhead. 3) MoH enables dynamic inference with adaptive horizons, which selects stable actions through cross-horizon consensus, achieving 2.5$\\times$ higher throughput than baselines while preserving superior performance. Extensive experiments over flow-based policies $\u03c0_0$, $\u03c0_{0.5}$, and one-step regression policy $\u03c0_{\\text{reg}}$ demonstrate that MoH yields consistent and significant gains on both simulations and real-world tasks. Notably, under mixed-task setting, $\u03c0_{0.5}$ with MoH reaches a new state-of-the-art with 99$\\%$ average success rate on LIBERO after only $30k$ training iterations.
