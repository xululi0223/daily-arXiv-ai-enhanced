However, that pioneering approach relied exclusively on shortest-path computations, which can fail to capture re- alistic travel behavior and thus reduce the utility of the anonymized data. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel, history-aware trajectory k-anonymization methodology and presents an advanced FPGA-based hardware architecture to implement it. Our proposed architecture uniquely integrates par- allel history-based trajectory searches with conventional shortest- path finding, using a custom fixed-point counting module to ac- curately weigh contributions from historical data. This approach enables the system to prioritize behaviorally common routes over geometrically shorter but less-traveled paths. The FPGA implementation demonstrates that our new architecture achieves a real-time throughput of over 6,000 records/s, improves data retention by up to 1.2% compared to our previous shortest-path- only design, and preserves major arterial roads more effectively. These results signify a key advancement, enabling high-fidelity, history-aware anonymization that preserves both privacy and behavioral accuracy under the strict latency constraints of LBS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eFPGA\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u8f68\u8ff9k-\u533f\u540d\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u8f68\u8ff9\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5148\u524d\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u533f\u540d\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u65c5\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86FPGA\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5e76\u884c\u5386\u53f2\u8f68\u8ff9\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u67e5\u627e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b9a\u70b9\u8ba1\u6570\u6a21\u5757\u51c6\u786e\u52a0\u6743\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc76,000\u6761\u8bb0\u5f55/\u79d2\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u7559\u7387\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u9ad81.2%\uff0c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u4e3b\u8981\u5e72\u9053\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u533f\u540d\u5316\uff0c\u5728LBS\u4e25\u683c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing assertion generation methods based on design specifications typically produce only top-level assertions, overlooking verification needs on the implementation details in the modules at the micro-architectural level, where design errors occur more frequently. To address this limitation, we present AssertMiner, a module-level assertion generation framework that leverages static information generated from abstract syntax tree (AST) to assist LLMs in mining assertions. Specifically, it performs AST-based structural extraction to derive the module call graph, I/O table, and dataflow graph, guiding the LLM to generate module-level specifications and mine module-level assertions. Our evaluation demonstrates that AssertMiner outperforms existing methods such as AssertLLM and Spec2Assertion in generating high-quality assertions for modules.

Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy.

However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis proving that FedeCouple converges for nonconvex objectives, with iterates approaching a stationary point as the number of communication rounds increases. Extensive experiments conducted on five image-classification datasets demonstrate that FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baseline methods in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security. Notably, in experiments evaluating effectiveness, FedeCouple surpasses the best baseline by a significant margin of 4.3%.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedeCouple\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c42\u9762\u5e73\u8861\u5168\u5c40\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u4f20\u8f93\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ec4\u4ef6\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u8026\u5408\u5f31\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u951a\u70b9\u6765\u7cbe\u70bc\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5176\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u975e\u4f20\u8f93\u6027\u5929\u7136\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedeCouple\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e5d\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cFedeCouple\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd54.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "FedeCouple\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5e73\u8861\u5168\u5c40\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7ec4\u4ef6\u534f\u8c03\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we review existing beamspace data detection algorithms and propose new algorithms as well as corresponding VLSI architectures that reduce data detection power. We present VLSI implementation results for the proposed architectures in a 22nm FDSOI process. Our results demonstrate that a fully-parallelized implementation of the proposed complex sparsity-adaptive equalizer (CSPADE) achieves up to 54% power savings compared to antenna-domain equalization.

We revisit this assumption and conduct a systematic comparison between the effect of selection and ordering. Through controlled experiments on both classification and generation tasks, using multiple open-source model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, we find that the variance in performance due to different example orderings is comparable to that from using entirely different example sets. Furthermore, we show that strong orderings can be identified using only a development set, achieving performance close to an oracle that selects the best ordering based on test labels.

We investigate the efficient scheduling of transactions in a network of fog-cloud computing model, where transactions and their associated shared objects can move within the network. The schedule may require objects to move to transaction nodes, or the transactions to move to the object nodes. Moreover, the schedule may determine intermediate nodes where both objects and transactions meet. Our goal is to minimize the total combined cost of the schedule. We focus on networks of constant doubling dimension, which appear frequently in practice. We consider a batch problem where an arbitrary set of nodes has transactions that need to be scheduled. First, we consider a single shared object required by all the transactions and present a scheduling algorithm that gives an $O(\\log n \\cdot \\log D)$ approximation of the optimal schedule, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $D$ is the diameter of the network. Later, we consider transactions accessing multiple shared objects (at most $k$ objects per transaction) and provide a scheduling algorithm that gives an $O(k \\cdot \\log n \\cdot \\log D)$ approximation.

To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency.

Despite being highly performant, GPU systems suffer from performance variation at the node and cluster levels. Such performance variation significantly impacts both high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads, such as cutting-edge large language models (LLMs). We analyze the performance of a single-node multi-GPU system running LLM training, and observe that the kernel-level performance variation is highly correlated with concurrent computation communication (C3), a technique to overlap computation and communication across GPUs for performance gains. We then take a further step to reason that thermally induced straggling coupling with C3 impacts performance variation, coined as the Lit Silicon effect. Lit Silicon describes that in a multi-GPU node, thermal imbalance across GPUs introduces node-level straggler GPUs, which in turn slow down the leader GPUs. Lit Silicon leads to node-level performance variation and inefficiency, impacting the entire datacenter from the bottom up. We propose analytical performance and power models for Lit Silicon, to understand the potential system-level gains. We further design simple detection and mitigation techniques to effectively address the Lit Silicon problem, and evaluate three different power management solutions, including power optimization under GPU thermal design power, performance optimization under node-level GPU power capping, and performance optimization under node-level CPU power sloshing. We conduct experiments on two workloads on two AMD InstinctTM MI300X GPU systems under two LLM training frameworks, and observe up to 6% performance and 4% power improvements, potentially saving hundreds of millions of dollars in datacenters. Our solution is almost free lunch and can be effortlessly adopted in datacenters as a new node-level power management layer.", "AI": {"tldr": "GPU\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8fd0\u884cLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u70ed\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\"Lit Silicon\"\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u7535\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad86%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c4%\u7684\u529f\u8017\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "GPU\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u96c6\u7fa4\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u548cAI\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff08\u5982LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u5355\u8282\u70b9\u591aGPU\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u70ed\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\"Lit Silicon\"\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u529f\u8017\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u7535\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2aAMD MI300X GPU\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4e24\u4e2aLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe6%\uff0c\u529f\u8017\u4f18\u5316\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe4%\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8282\u7701\u6570\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u7535\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u5c42\u8f7b\u677e\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3Lit Silicon\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In fact, they have been shown to be suboptimal for morphologically rich languages, where tokenization quality directly impacts downstream performance. In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linguistic resources to improve language modeling for morphologically complex languages. For low-resource languages that lack large-scale pretraining data, the development and incorporation of linguistic resources can serve as a feasible alternative to improve LM performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u62c9\u4e01\u8bed\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u5f62\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5916\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u4f4e\u751f\u80b2\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f62\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5206\u8bcd\u8d28\u91cf\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u62c9\u4e01\u8bed\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u8bcd\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u62c9\u4e01\u8bed\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7b49\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bcd\u5178\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5f62\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5f62\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5916\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u8d44\u6e90\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While hybrid parallelization strategies enable such pretraining, the vast combinatorial strategy space introduces significant optimization challenges. Traditional manual tuning methods incur prohibitive trial-and-error costs, and existing performance modeling approaches exhibit critical limitations: they fail to comprehensively account for prevalent optimization features and ignore the substantial overhead imposed by essential fault tolerance mechanisms like checkpoint recovery in long-duration pretraining. To address these gaps, we propose MoFa, a novel pretraining performance modeling framework that unifies multi-dimensional optimization features and fault tolerance. MoFa incorporates an enhanced cost model to accurately capture the effects of key optimizations and integrates a fault tolerance model based on historical cluster reliability data.

Computer vision could greatly aid this research, but existing methods often rely on human-centric pretrained models and focus on single datasets, which limits generalization. We address this limitation by shifting from a model-centric to a data-centric approach and introduce PriVi, a large-scale primate-centric video pretraining dataset. PriVi contains 424 hours of curated video, combining 174 hours from behavioral research across 11 settings with 250 hours of diverse web-sourced footage, assembled through a scalable data curation pipeline. We pretrain V-JEPA on PriVi to learn primate-specific representations and evaluate it using a lightweight frozen classifier. Across four benchmark datasets, ChimpACT, BaboonLand, PanAf500, and ChimpBehave, our approach consistently outperforms prior work, including fully finetuned baselines, and scales favorably with fewer labels. These results demonstrate that primate-centric pretraining substantially improves data efficiency and generalization, making it a promising approach for low-label applications.

It occurs on a continuum from mild to severe, and treatment options can vary based on severity. Assessment of severity involves a clinician's expert judgment, which is costly and can vary widely in reliability. In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions. Our proposed soft ordinal regression method achieves predictive performance approaching that of clinical experts, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. By providing an automated tool for phonotrauma severity assessment, our work can enable large-scale studies of phonotrauma, ultimately leading to improved clinical understanding and patient care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4ece\u58f0\u5e26\u56fe\u50cf\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u97f3\u58f0\u521b\u4f24\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e8f\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u6709\u5e8f\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u5904\u7406\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u97f3\u58f0\u521b\u4f24\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6539\u5584\u60a3\u8005\u62a4\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e8f\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u6709\u5e8f\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8f6f\u5e8f\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u53cd\u6620\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u8bc4\u5206\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f6f\u5e8f\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u97f3\u58f0\u521b\u4f24\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6539\u5584\u4e34\u5e8a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u62a4\u7406\u3002"}}

Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost. In contrast, ultra-small models (0.6B) remain usable with few-shot calibration yet under-detect entity and number errors. Overall, compact, instruction-tuned LLMs augmented with lightweight calibration and small-sample supervision can deliver trustworthy, on-device CED for MT, enabling private, low-cost error screening in real-world translation pipelines.

However, these models apply each instruction in the prompt with a fixed strength, limiting the user's ability to precisely and continuously control the intensity of individual edits. We introduce SliderEdit, a framework for continuous image editing with fine-grained, interpretable instruction control. Given a multi-part edit instruction, SliderEdit disentangles the individual instructions and exposes each as a globally trained slider, allowing smooth adjustment of its strength. Unlike prior works that introduced slider-based attribute controls in text-to-image generation, typically requiring separate training or fine-tuning for each attribute or concept, our method learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions. This enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while preserving both spatial locality and global semantic consistency. We apply SliderEdit to state-of-the-art image editing models, including FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit, and observe substantial improvements in edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability.

The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences.

This paper proposes a lightweight server-selection method for edge applications that fuses latency prediction with adaptive reliability and hysteresis-based handover. Using passive measurements (arrival rate, utilization, payload size) and an exponentially modulated rational delay model, the proposed Moderate Handover (MO-HAN) method computes a score that balances predicted latency and reliability to ensure handovers occur only when the expected gain is meaningful and maintain reduced end-to-end latency. Results show that MO-HAN consistently outperforms static and fair-distribution baselines by lowering mean and tail latencies, while reducing handovers by nearly 50% compared to pure opportunistic selection. These gains arise without intrusive instrumentation or heavy learning infrastructure, making MO-HAN practical for resource-constrained embedded devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMO-HAN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u51cf\u5c1150%\u5207\u6362\u6b21\u6570", "motivation": "\u591a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u62e5\u585e\u7ed9\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u88ab\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08\u5230\u8fbe\u7387\u3001\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5927\u5c0f\uff09\u548c\u6307\u6570\u8c03\u5236\u6709\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u8861\u9884\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6ede\u540e\u5207\u6362\u786e\u4fdd\u53ea\u5728\u9884\u671f\u6536\u76ca\u663e\u8457\u65f6\u624d\u8fdb\u884c\u5207\u6362", "result": "MO-HAN\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u5e03\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5e73\u5747\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6bd4\u7eaf\u673a\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd150%\u7684\u5207\u6362\u6b21\u6570", "conclusion": "MO-HAN\u65e0\u9700\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6216\u91cd\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5f3a"}}

A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including overlay plots and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the model demonstrates its ability to effectively capture crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings. The efficiency of the sampling method is further assessed, showcasing its capability to decrease frame counts while maintaining essential crowd events.

We propose Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG), a single-shot policy that decides when to retrieve using only a short, no-context draft from the base model. From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative.

Vision-based methods such as PALMS enable infrastructure-free localization using only a floor plan and a stationary scan, but are limited by the short range of smartphone LiDAR and ambiguity in indoor layouts. We propose PALMS$+$, a modular, image-based system that addresses these challenges by reconstructing scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using a foundation monocular depth estimation model (Depth Pro), followed by geometric layout matching via convolution with the floor plan. PALMS$+$ outputs a posterior over the location and orientation, usable for direct or sequential localization. Evaluated on the Structured3D and a custom campus dataset consisting of 80 observations across four large campus buildings, PALMS$+$ outperforms PALMS and F3Loc in stationary localization accuracy -- without requiring any training. Furthermore, when integrated with a particle filter for sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories, PALMS$+$ achieved lower localization errors compared to other methods, demonstrating robustness for camera-free tracking and its potential for infrastructure-free applications.

First, there are misalignments between words in the lexicon and the word segmentation model. Second, a Khmer word can be written in different forms. Third, Khmer compound words are often loosely and easily formed, and these compound words are not always found in the lexicon. Fourth, some proper nouns may be flagged as misspellings due to the absence of a Khmer named-entity recognition (NER) model. Unfortunately, existing solutions do not adequately address these challenges. This paper proposes a holistic approach to the Khmer spellchecking problem by integrating Khmer subword segmentation, Khmer NER, Khmer grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, and a Khmer language model to tackle these challenges, identify potential correction candidates, and rank the most suitable candidate. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art Khmer spellchecking accuracy of up to 94.4%, compared to existing solutions.

Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline. Moreover, the proposed model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models across most test sets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3aSocial LSTM\u7684\u65b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5360\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4d\u79fb\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u78b0\u649e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4eba\u7fa4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u884c\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5c06\u884c\u4eba\u89c6\u4e3a\u70b9\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u5b9e\u9645\u5360\u636e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u73b0\u5b9e\u78b0\u649e\u3002", "method": "\u5728Social LSTM\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u5360\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53ca\u4e2a\u4f53\u7a7a\u95f4\u5360\u7528\u654f\u611f\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1131%\u78b0\u649e\u7387\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e5%\u548c6%\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5360\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u907f\u514d\u73b0\u5b9e\u78b0\u649e\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u7fa4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In order to provide customised suggestions, the study entails the design and implementation of an extensive algorithmic framework that combines machine learning methods, user preferences, and academic criteria. The system employs data mining and collaborative filtering techniques to examine past courses and individual career goals in order to provide course recommendations. Moreover, to improve the accessibility and usefulness of the recommendation system, special attention is given to the development of an easy-to-use front-end interface. The front-end design prioritises visual clarity, interaction, and simplicity through iterative prototyping and user input revisions, guaranteeing a smooth and captivating user experience. We refined and optimised the proposed system by incorporating user feedback, ensuring that it effectively meets the needs and preferences of its target users. The proposed course recommendation system could be a useful tool for students, instructors, and career advisers to use in promoting lifelong learning and professional progression as it fills the gap between university learning and industry expectations.

Such modeling is essential for pre-deployment system-level optimizations (e.g., parallelization strategies) and design-space explorations. While recent efforts have proposed collecting execution traces from real systems, access to large-scale infrastructure remains limited to major cloud providers. Moreover, traces obtained from existing platforms cannot be easily adapted to study future larger-scale system configurations. We introduce Symbolic Tensor grAph GEnerator(STAGE), a framework that synthesizes high-fidelity execution traces to accurately model LLM workloads.

It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f308\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u7279\u5f81\u6548\u7528\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u75c5\u7406\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u3001\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f308\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u6c14\u80f8\u3001\u5fc3\u810f\u80a5\u5927\uff09\u548c\u5206\u5272\uff08\u6c14\u80f8\u3001\u5fc3\u810f\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u7a81\u51fa\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ec6\u5fae\u75c5\u7406\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u6dc6\u6377\u5f84\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b\u56fe\u50cf\u4ec5\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1b\u76d1\u7763\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533b\u5b66\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u76ca\uff0c\u4f46\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u904d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u662f\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u3002"}}

This weakness in terminology-level representation can severely hinder downstream tasks such as legal judgment prediction or financial risk analysis, where subtle semantic distinctions are critical. To address this problem, we propose TermGPT, a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework designed for terminology adaptation. We first construct a sentence graph to capture semantic and structural relations, and generate semantically consistent yet discriminative positive and negative samples based on contextual and topological cues. We then devise a multi-level contrastive learning approach at both the sentence and token levels, enhancing global contextual understanding and fine-grained terminology discrimination. To support robust evaluation, we construct the first financial terminology dataset derived from official regulatory documents.

Because of the rich texture of iris images, which spans a wide range of spatial frequencies, synthesizing same-identity iris images while controlling specific attributes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a new iris image augmentation strategy by traversing a generative model's latent space toward latent codes that represent same-identity samples but with some desired iris image properties manipulated. The latent space traversal is guided by a gradient of specific geometrical, textural, or quality-related iris image features (e.g., sharpness, pupil size, iris size, or pupil-to-iris ratio) and preserves the identity represented by the image being manipulated. The proposed approach can be easily extended to manipulate any attribute for which a differentiable loss term can be formulated. Additionally, our approach can use either randomly generated images using either a pre-train GAN model or real-world iris images. We can utilize GAN inversion to project any given iris image into the latent space and obtain its corresponding latent code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u904d\u5386\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63a7\u5236\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0d\u53d8", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8679\u819c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5448\u73b0\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u8679\u819c\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u5408\u6210\u76f8\u540c\u8eab\u4efd\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u540c\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u64cd\u7eb5\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u6216\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u77b3\u5b54\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u8679\u819c\u5927\u5c0f\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u53d8", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4efb\u4f55\u53ef\u5fae\u635f\u5931\u9879\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3GAN\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u771f\u5b9e\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u63a7\u5236\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u540c\u8eab\u4efd\u8679\u819c\u6837\u672c"}}

To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model. Its chains of thought are also notably more concise, exhibiting reduced verbosity.

Although pipeline parallelism alleviates memory pressure by partitioning models across devices, it incurs activation communication overhead that scales linearly with sequence length, limiting efficiency in long-context training. Recent weight-passing approaches (e.g., WeiPipe) mitigate this by transmitting model weights instead of activations, but suffer from redundant peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers and underutilized intra-node bandwidth. We propose TawPipe--topology-aware weight pipeline parallelism, which exploits hierarchical bandwidth in distributed clusters for improved communication efficiency. TawPipe: (i) groups devices based on topology to optimize intra-node collective and inter-node P2P communication; (ii) assigns each device a fixed shard of model weights and gradients, avoiding redundant transfers; and (iii) overlaps communication with computation to hide latency. Unlike global collective operations used in fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP), TawPipe confines most communication within node boundaries, significantly reducing cross-node traffic.

However, existing approaches typically rely on a manually annotated segmentation mask of the target in the first frame, which is labor-intensive and leads to reduced performance when faced with occlusions or rapid movement. To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation.

To address this, we propose HierRouter, a hierarchical routing approach that dynamically assembles inference pipelines from a pool of specialized, lightweight language models. Formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), our approach trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning agent to iteratively select which models to invoke at each stage of multi-hop inference. The agent conditions on the evolving context and accumulated cost to make context-aware routing decisions. Experiments with three open-source candidate LLMs across six benchmarks, including QA, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, show that HierRouter improves response quality by up to 2.4x compared to using individual models independently, while incurring only a minimal additional inference cost on average.

However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability.

For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

To tackle the challenges of noisy and heterogeneous raw data and the limited adaptability of existing Omni-Models to hearing-impaired speech, we construct a comprehensive preprocessing and curation pipeline that detects facial landmarks, isolates and stabilizes the lip region, and quantitatively assesses multimodal sample quality. These quality scores guide a curriculum learning strategy that first trains on clean, high-confidence samples and progressively incorporates harder cases to strengthen model robustness. We further adopt a SigLIP encoder combined with a Unified 3D-Resampler to efficiently encode high-frame-rate lip motion.

Our evaluation is performed on a physical testbed representing a real-world industrial scenario and shows that Pk-IOTA introduces a minimal overhead while providing a scalable and tamper-proof mechanism for OPC UA certificate management.", "AI": {"tldr": "Pk-IOTA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u9762\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u8fdb\u884c\u7f51\u7edc\u5185\u8bc1\u4e66\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528IOTA Tangle\u8fdb\u884c\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bc1\u4e66\u5206\u53d1\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u62a4OPC UA\u901a\u4fe1\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "motivation": "OPC UA\u534f\u8bae\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a4.0\u673a\u5668\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u8bc1\u4e66\u7ba1\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u8bbe\u5907\u5b89\u5168\u529f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u9762\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u8fdb\u884c\u7f51\u7edc\u5185\u8bc1\u4e66\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528IOTA Tangle\u5b9e\u73b0\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bc1\u4e66\u5206\u53d1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cPk-IOTA\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u6700\u5c0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3aOPC UA\u8bc1\u4e66\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9632\u7be1\u6539\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "Pk-IOTA\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3OPC UA\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc1\u4e66\u7ba1\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Most existing approaches depend on precomputed camera poses and scene-specific optimization, which greatly restricts their scala- bility to dynamic real-world environments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Lumos3D, a generalizable pose-free framework for 3D low-light scene restoration. Trained once on a single dataset, Lumos3D performs inference in a purely feed- forward manner, directly restoring illumination and structure from unposed, low-light multi-view images without any per- scene training or optimization. Built upon a geometry-grounded backbone, Lumos3D reconstructs a normal-light 3D Gaussian representation that restores illumination while faithfully pre- serving structural details. During training, a cross-illumination distillation scheme is employed, where the teacher network is distilled on normal-light ground truth to transfer accurate geometric information, such as depth, to the student model. A dedicated Lumos loss is further introduced to promote photomet- ric consistency within the reconstructed 3D space. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Lumos3D achieves high- fidelity low-light 3D scene restoration with accurate geometry and strong generalization to unseen cases. Furthermore, the framework naturally extends to handle over-exposure correction, highlighting its versatility for diverse lighting restoration tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Lumos3D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u7684\u901a\u7528\u53163D\u4f4e\u5149\u573a\u666f\u6062\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u65e0\u4f4d\u59ff\u7684\u4f4e\u5149\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u5149\u7167\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9010\u573a\u666f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u4f4e\u5149\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u91cd\u5efa\u6b63\u5e38\u5149\u7167\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u5149\u7167\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6559\u5e08\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u5149\u7167\u771f\u503c\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u4f20\u9012\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u7ed9\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Lumos\u635f\u5931\u4fc3\u8fdb3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u4f4e\u51493D\u573a\u666f\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u51c6\u786e\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8fc7\u66dd\u6821\u6b63\u3002", "conclusion": "Lumos3D\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5149\u7167\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u4f4d\u59ff\u548c\u9010\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u6062\u590d\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches often require supervised training on curated datasets and rely on panoramic or UAV-based images, which limits real-world deployment. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective cross-view image retrieval framework that leverages a pretrained vision encoder and a large language model (LLM), requiring no additional training. Given a monocular street-view image, our method extracts geographic cues through web-based image search and LLM-based location inference, generates a satellite query via geocoding API, and retrieves matching tiles using a pretrained vision encoder (e.g., DINOv2) with PCA-based whitening feature refinement. Despite using no ground-truth supervision or finetuning, our proposed method outperforms prior learning-based approaches on the benchmark dataset under zero-shot settings.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a \"simulated textbook\" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6(KCs)\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u662f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f46\u624b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\u3002\u867d\u7136LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c0f\u3001\u751f\u6210\u6807\u7b7e\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4o-mini\u5728646\u4e2a\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55\"\u6a21\u62df\u6559\u79d1\u4e66\"\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59KCs\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u59cbLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b(RMSE 0.4285 vs 0.4206)\uff0c\u751f\u6210569\u4e2aKCs(\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e3a101\u4e2a)\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u9608\u503c0.8\u5408\u5e76\u540e\uff0cKCs\u51cf\u5c11\u5230428\u4e2a\uff0cRMSE\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.4259\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u7684LLM\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u8db3\u591f\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316KC\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Animating Human Avatars in Diverse Scenes with Gaussian Splatting", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "We present a novel framework for animating humans in 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a neural scene representation that has recently achieved state-of-the-art photorealistic results for novel-view synthesis but remains under-explored for human-scene animation and interaction. Unlike existing animation pipelines that use meshes or point clouds as the underlying 3D representation, our approach introduces the use of 3DGS as the 3D representation to the problem of animating humans in scenes. By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework allows for novel applications such as geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with new animated humans, showcasing the unique advantage of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85(3DGS)\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57283D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u52a8\u753b\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "motivation": "3DGS\u5728\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5149\u7167\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u753b\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u753b\u6d41\u7a0b\u4f7f\u7528\u7f51\u683c\u6216\u70b9\u4e91\u4f5c\u4e3a3D\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75283DGS\u4f5c\u4e3a3D\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u89e3\u8026\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u5305\u62ec\u9ad8\u65af\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u9ad8\u65af\u7ed3\u6784\u6307\u5bfc\u4eba\u4f53\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u548c\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u9ad8\u65af\u7ec6\u5316\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u786e\u4fdd\u771f\u5b9e\u63a5\u89e6\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728Scannet++\u548cSuperSplat\u5e93\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4ee5\u53ca\u7a00\u758f/\u5bc6\u96c6\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4eba\u4f53\u6355\u6349\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u865a\u62df\u89d2\u8272\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u5355\u76eeRGB\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e863DGS\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u52a8\u753b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues.

However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FedSTGD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u91cd\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u56fe\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5904\u7406\u9759\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdd\u53cd\u6570\u636e\u672c\u5730\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5efa\u6a21\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "FedSTGD\u5305\u542b\u8054\u90a6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u56fe\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u7f13\u89e3\u5206\u89e3\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef-\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u96c6\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u534f\u8bae\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedSTGD\u5728RMSE\u3001MAE\u548cMAPE\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u5404\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "FedSTGD\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u91cd\u6784\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose CertMask, a certifiably robust defense that constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks to neutralize patch effects with strong theoretical guarantees. While the state-of-the-art approach (PatchCleanser) requires two rounds of masking and incurs $O(n^2)$ inference cost, CertMask performs only a single round of masking with $O(n)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the cardinality of the mask set to cover an input image. Our proposed mask set is computed using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each possible patch location is covered at least $k$ times, providing both efficiency and robustness. We offer a theoretical analysis of the coverage condition and prove its sufficiency for certification.

Our results indicate that even leading proprietary systems experience accuracy drops of up to 62\\% under certain perturbations. No model proves to be robust across all conditions. We further find that increasing context length generally reduces accuracy, but when extended context is enriched with perturbed demonstrations, most models substantially recover.

Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures. Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks. As a first proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions.

A central challenge in this setting lies in determining the optimal timing for retrieval. Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. Ablation studies and qualitative analyses further confirm that trend-aware uncertainty modeling yields more effective retrieval timing.

However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.\n  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data. Experiments across three multilingual datasets and multiple typologically diverse languages show that SCD consistently improves language alignment and task performance, providing an effective and generalizable solution in multilingual RAG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u4e2d\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ea7\u5d29\u6e83\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565SCD\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00RAG\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSoft Constrained Decoding (SCD)\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bb0\u6765\u6e29\u548c\u5730\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u671d\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u591a\u6837\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSCD\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SCD\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00RAG\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8f93\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence. Together, the T-DRS recover suppressed long-range token pairs without harming local inductive biases. Extensive experiments on Vision Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks demonstrate that T-DRS can consistently improve performance in a training-free manner.

Some researchers have attempted to directly apply the foundation model to the RGB-D video salient object detection (RGB-D VSOD) task, which often encounters three challenges, including the dependence on manual prompts, the high memory consumption of sequential adapters, and the computational burden of memory attention. To address the limitations, we propose a novel method, namely Segment Anything Model with Depth-guided Adaptive Queries (SAM-DAQ), which adapts SAM2 to pop-out salient objects from videos by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal cues within a unified framework. Firstly, we deploy a parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder (PAMIE), which incorporates several depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a skip-connection way. Remarkably, we fine-tune the frozen SAM encoder under prompt-free conditions, where the DPA utilizes depth cues to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal features. Secondly, we deploy a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module, which unifies the memory bank and prompt embeddings into a learnable pipeline. Concretely, by leveraging both frame-level queries and video-level queries simultaneously, the QTM module can not only selectively extract temporal consistency features but also iteratively update the temporal representations of the queries.

Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring.

We suggest that this can be a compelling probe into how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in human languages. We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities.

One key reason is that tiny objects carry limited features that are inevitably degraded or lost during long-distance network propagation. Another is that smaller objects receive disproportionately greater regression penalties than larger ones during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and a Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) for tiny object detection, both of which are seamlessly compatible with the top-performing frameworks. Specifically, SARL employs a cross-scale spatial-channel attention to progressively enrich the meaningful features of each layer and strengthen the cross-layer feature sharing. SAL reshapes the vanilla IoU-based losses so as to dynamically assign lower weights to larger objects. This loss is able to focus training on tiny objects while reducing the influence on large objects.

However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "GraphIF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u4e3a\u5b64\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u660e\u786e\u5c06\u591a\u8f6e\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u7eb3\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "GraphIF\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u4f5c\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u6355\u83b7\u8f6e\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56fe\uff09\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56fe\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u91cd\u5199\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u521d\u59cbLLM\u8f93\u51fa\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u957f\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGraphIF\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u7684LLMs\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6240\u6709\u56db\u4e2a\u591a\u8f6e\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u8f6e\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\uff0cGraphIF\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing methods for Single-DGOD typically rely on discrete data augmentation or static perturbation methods to expand data diversity, thereby mitigating the lack of access to target domain data. However, in real-world scenarios such as changes in weather or lighting conditions, domain shifts often occur continuously and gradually. Discrete augmentations and static perturbations fail to effectively capture the dynamic variation of feature distributions, thereby limiting the model's ability to perceive fine-grained cross-domain differences. To this end, we propose a new method, Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution, which simulates the progressive evolution of features from the source domain to simulated latent distributions by incorporating temporal modeling and liquid neural network-driven parameter adjustment. Specifically, we introduce controllable Gaussian noise injection and multi-scale Gaussian blurring to simulate initial feature perturbations, followed by temporal modeling and a liquid parameter adjustment mechanism to generate adaptive modulation parameters, enabling a smooth and continuous adaptation across domains. By capturing progressive cross-domain feature evolution and dynamically regulating adaptation paths, our method bridges the source-unknown domain distribution gap, significantly boosting generalization and robustness to unseen shifts. Significant performance improvements on the Diverse Weather dataset and Real-to-Art benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\u58f0\u660e\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc1\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\uff08\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\uff09\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u79d1\u5b66\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u7f16\u4e24\u4e2a\u73b0\u6709\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3012\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5728\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff088B\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09\u5728\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f31\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u91cd\u70b9\u6539\u8fdb\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u652f\u6301\u79d1\u5b66\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier. Additionally, we introduce an adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism to achieve dual-generalization for both unseen identities and unseen attack types.

While powerful, ViGs often face substantial computational challenges stemming from their graph construction phase, which can hinder their efficiency. To address this issue we propose AdaptViG, an efficient and powerful hybrid Vision GNN that introduces a novel graph construction mechanism called Adaptive Graph Convolution. This mechanism builds upon a highly efficient static axial scaffold and a dynamic, content-aware gating strategy called Exponential Decay Gating. This gating mechanism selectively weighs long-range connections based on feature similarity. Furthermore, AdaptViG employs a hybrid strategy, utilizing our efficient gating mechanism in the early stages and a full Global Attention block in the final stage for maximum feature aggregation. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among Vision GNNs.

To address this, we propose Text2SQL-Flow, a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, semantically valid, and structurally diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data. It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever.

In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength.

However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation.

In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains.

This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL).

Extensive experiments demonstrate that VocalNet-M2 achieves a substantial reduction in first chunk latency (from approximately 725ms to 350ms) while maintaining competitive performance across mainstream SLMs. This work also provides a comprehensive comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies, offering valuable insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "VocalNet-M2\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7801\u672c\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u548c\u591a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4ece\u7ea6725ms\u964d\u81f3350ms\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e3b\u6d41SLM\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVocalNet-M2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u7801\u672c\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u591a\u7801\u672c\u8bed\u97f3\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f7f\u7528\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eVocalNet-M2\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u9996\u5757\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08\u4ece\u7ea6725ms\u5230350ms\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41SLM\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5355\u7801\u672c\u4e0e\u591a\u7801\u672c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdSLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u7801\u672c\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Chaturvedi", "Gaurav Bagwe", "Lan Zhang", "Pan He", "Xiaoyong Yuan"], "title": "MOBA: A Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack against LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection Systems", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": "Accepted at AAAI 2026 Conference", "summary": "LiDAR-based 3D object detection is widely used in safety-critical systems. However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%.

Existing methods primarily rely on two forms of weak supervision: one-thing-one-click annotations and bounding box annotations, both of which aim to reduce labeling efforts. However, these approaches still encounter limitations, including labor-intensive annotation processes, high complexity, and reliance on expert annotators. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{DBGroup}, a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that leverages scene-level annotations as a more efficient and scalable alternative. In the first stage, we introduce a Dual-Branch Point Grouping module to generate pseudo labels guided by semantic and mask cues extracted from multi-view images. To further improve label quality, we develop two refinement strategies: Granularity-Aware Instance Merging and Semantic Selection and Propagation. The second stage involves multi-round self-training on an end-to-end instance segmentation network using the refined pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce an Instance Mask Filter strategy to address inconsistencies within the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBGroup achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods, while surpassing state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \\textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct.

Quantization algorithms compress Vision Transformers (ViTs) into low-bit formats, reducing memory and computation demands with minimal accuracy degradation. However, existing methods rely on uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of ViT components to quantization. Metric-based Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) is a promising alternative, but previous MPQ methods for ViTs suffer from three major limitations: 1) coarse granularity, 2) mismatch in metric scale across component types, and 3) quantization-unaware bit allocation. In this paper, we propose LampQ (Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers), an accurate metric-based MPQ method for ViTs to overcome these limitations. LampQ performs layer-wise quantization to achieve both fine-grained control and efficient acceleration, incorporating a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. Then, LampQ assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming and further updates them iteratively.

We analyze how language choice, both in the prompt instructions and document grounding, affects data quality, and we compare translations of English content with native generation in Indic languages.

We introduce MIRNet (Medical Image Reasoner Network), a novel framework that integrates self-supervised pre-training with constrained graph-based reasoning. Tongue image diagnosis is a particularly challenging domain that requires fine-grained visual and semantic understanding. Our approach leverages self-supervised masked autoencoder (MAE) to learn transferable visual representations from unlabeled data; employs graph attention networks (GAT) to model label correlations through expert-defined structured graphs; enforces clinical priors via constraint-aware optimization using KL divergence and regularization losses; and mitigates imbalance using asymmetric loss (ASL) and boosting ensembles.

This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies. ATR4CH provides a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and institutional resources. Research Limitations - The produced KG is limited to Wikipedia articles. While the results are encouraging, human oversight is necessary during post-processing. Practical Implications - ATR4CH enables Cultural Heritage institutions to systematically convert textual knowledge into queryable KGs, supporting automated metadata enrichment and knowledge discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "ATR4CH\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e94\u6b65\u6cd5LLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u6587\u672c\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u96be\u4ee5\u5c06\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bba\u8ff0\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6807\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u672c\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u548cLLM\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u4e94\u6b65\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u7840\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u7ba1\u9053\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2aLLM\uff08Claude Sonnet 3.7\u3001Llama 3.3 70B\u3001GPT-4o-mini\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5e8f\u5217\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u53d6\u590d\u6742\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1a\u5143\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6F1 0.96-0.99\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522bF1 0.7-0.8\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u53d6F1 0.65-0.75\uff0c\u8bc1\u636e\u63d0\u53d6F1 0.95-0.97\uff0c\u8bba\u8ff0\u8868\u793aG-EVAL 0.62\u3002\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u8c03LLM\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f46\u9650\u4e8e\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u540e\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

Existing approaches often operate at the object level or disjointedly handle fine-grained affordance reasoning, lacking coherent, instruction-driven grounding and reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new task: Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, which requires an agent to predict, for each referenced affordance element in a 3D scene, a structured triplet comprising its spatial location, motion type, and motion axis, based on a task instruction. To solve this task, we propose AffordBot, a novel framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a tailored chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm. To bridge the gap between 3D input and 2D-compatible MLLMs, we render surround-view images of the scene and project 3D element candidates into these views, forming a rich visual representation aligned with the scene geometry. Our CoT pipeline begins with an active perception stage, prompting the MLLM to select the most informative viewpoint based on the instruction, before proceeding with step-by-step reasoning to localize affordance elements and infer plausible interaction motions.

As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "TruthfulRAG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u89e3\u51b3RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3001\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u6765\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51b2\u7a81\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8fc7\u65f6\uff0cRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0eLLM\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5728token\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "TruthfulRAG\u4ece\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u53d6\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51b2\u7a81\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTruthfulRAG\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "TruthfulRAG\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u89e3\u51b3RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4f7fLLM\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies. We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed. In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility. This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following.

However, detecting distant, small, or occluded objects (hard instances) remains a challenge, which directly compromises the safety of autonomous driving systems. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\\% mAP, +0.8\\% NDS, and +1.3\\% average recall on nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent robustness gains for hard instance detection across ego-distance, size, visibility, and small-scale training scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "DGFusion\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u5f15\u5bfc\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u60013D\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u914d\u5bf9\u5339\u914d\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7b80\u5355\u548c\u56f0\u96be\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5bf9\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56f0\u96be\u5b9e\u4f8b\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u5f15\u5bfc\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u60013D\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u56f0\u96be\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u8fdc\u5904\u3001\u5c0f\u578b\u6216\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDGFusion\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u914d\u5bf9\u5339\u914d\u5668(DIPM)\u548c\u53cc\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u5757\u3002DIPM\u57fa\u4e8e\u96be\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u751f\u6210\u7b80\u5355\u548c\u56f0\u96be\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5bf9\uff0c\u53cc\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u5757\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u914d\u5bf9\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDGFusion\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86+1.0% mAP\u3001+0.8% NDS\u548c+1.3%\u5e73\u5747\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u548c\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u56f0\u96be\u5b9e\u4f8b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5747\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "DGFusion\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5f15\u5bfc\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u5f15\u5bfc\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u5b9e\u4f8b\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u76843D\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The goal of this paper is to address these issues with two main contributions. The first contribution is DELICATE, a novel neuro-symbolic method for EL on historical Italian which combines a BERT-based encoder with contextual information from Wikidata to select appropriate KB entities using temporal plausibility and entity type consistency. The second contribution is ENEIDE, a multi-domain EL corpus in historical Italian semi-automatically extracted from two annotated editions spanning from the 19th to the 20th century and including literary and political texts. Results show how DELICATE outperforms other EL models in historical Italian even if compared with larger architectures with billions of parameters. Moreover, further analyses reveal how DELICATE confidence scores and features sensitivity provide results which are more explainable and interpretable than purely neural methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DELICATE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408BERT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cWikidata\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u521b\u5efa\u4e86ENEIDE\u591a\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u6587\u5b66\u79d1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u590d\u6742\u6587\u6863\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e2d\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u5b9e\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "DELICATE\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408BERT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0eWikidata\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u5b9e\u4f53\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86ENEIDE\u591a\u9886\u57df\u5386\u53f2\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u3002", "result": "DELICATE\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4e0e\u5177\u6709\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5927\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u76f8\u6bd4\uff1b\u5176\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u654f\u611f\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6bd4\u7eaf\u795e\u7ecf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "DELICATE\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0cENEIDE\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Prevailing methods based on signed distance fields (SDFs) are hampered by costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations often suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) framework built upon unsigned distance fields (UDFs)-a more robust and computationally efficient representation that naturally handles complex and incomplete shapes. Our core innovation is a local-to-global (LoG) architecture that processes the UDF by partitioning it into uniform subvolumes, termed UBlocks. This architecture couples 3D convolutions for capturing local detail with sparse transformers for enforcing global coherence. A Pad-Average strategy further ensures smooth transitions at subvolume boundaries during reconstruction. This modular design enables seamless scaling to ultra-high resolutions up to 2048^3-a regime previously unattainable for 3D VAEs.

Can analogical paradigm organization enable lightweight models to match this performance with minimal data? We develop a computational approach implementing three cognitive-inspired principles: analogical structure, contrastive learning, and minimal contextual cues. We test this approach with structured completion tasks where models identify correct sentence completions from analogical patterns with contrastive alternatives. Training lightweight models (BERT+CNN, $0.5M$ parameters) on only one hundred structured examples of English causative/inchoative alternations achieves $F1=0.95$, outperforming zero-shot \\texttt{GPT-o3} ($F1=0.87$).

In this paper, we reveal a key property that is overlooked by existing methods: normal image patches across industrial products typically find many other similar patches, not only in 2D appearance but also in 3D shapes, while anomalies remain diverse and isolated. To explicitly leverage this discriminative property, we propose a Mutual Scoring framework (MuSc-V2) for zero-shot AC/AS, which flexibly supports single 2D/3D or multimodality. Specifically, our method begins by improving 3D representation through Iterative Point Grouping (IPG), which reduces false positives from discontinuous surfaces. Then we use Similarity Neighborhood Aggregation with Multi-Degrees (SNAMD) to fuse 2D/3D neighborhood cues into more discriminative multi-scale patch features for mutual scoring. The core comprises a Mutual Scoring Mechanism (MSM) that lets samples within each modality to assign score to each other, and Cross-modal Anomaly Enhancement (CAE) that fuses 2D and 3D scores to recover modality-specific missing anomalies. Finally, Re-scoring with Constrained Neighborhood (RsCon) suppresses false classification based on similarity to more representative samples. Our framework flexibly works on both the full dataset and smaller subsets with consistently robust performance, ensuring seamless adaptability across diverse product lines.

However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning.

Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%.

Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences. Extensive experiments on audio-visual question answering and audio-visual hallucination show that RL-CoMM improves the accuracy by 10~30\\% over the baseline model with limited training data.

These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

Hybrid Spatial Encoding, employing a Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy, effectively utilizes skeletal information in the form of joint and bone features.

This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias. To correct noisy supervision, CABIN introduces a Fine-Grained Dynamic Assignment Strategy that categorizes pseudo-labeled data into reliable, ambiguous, and noisy subsets, applying tailored losses to enhance generalization.

Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image. This unified representation eliminates the need for modality-specific streams or retransmissions, improving spectral efficiency and adaptability.

In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.\n  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates.

Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness. Extensive evaluations on standard co-speech benchmarks show that GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, improving the performance by 46.0 % compared to the current SOTA under multiple speaker identities.", "AI": {"tldr": "GlobalDiff\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u8282\u65cb\u8f6c\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6848\u89e3\u51b3\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bef\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5171\u8bed\u97f3\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u5173\u8282\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65cb\u8f6c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9aa8\u67b6\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5c42\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u672b\u7aef\u6548\u5e94\u5668\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGlobalDiff\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u8282\u65cb\u8f6c\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u9aa8\u67b6\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5171\u8bed\u97f3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cGlobalDiff\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0b\u6bd4\u5f53\u524dSOTA\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534746.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5168\u5c40\u65cb\u8f6c\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u5173\u8282\u9884\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u5206\u5c42\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5171\u8bed\u97f3\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive.

However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to (\"where to look\") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail (\"what to select\"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing \"what to select\", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider \"where to look\", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a \"guide-globally, select-locally\" zonal selection system.

While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction. Then, we use logistic regression to model the effect that each feature has on literary classification and to measure how author gender moderates these effects. Finally, we analyze stylistic and semantic vector representations of our genre categories to understand the importance of form and content in literary classification.

Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency.

However, the security vulnerabilities of LVLMs have become increasingly concerning, particularly their susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks focus on single-target attacks, i.e., targeting a single malicious output associated with a specific trigger. In this work, we uncover multi-target backdoor attacks, where multiple independent triggers corresponding to different attack targets are added in a single pass of training, posing a greater threat to LVLMs in real-world applications. Executing such attacks in LVLMs is challenging since there can be many incorrect trigger-target mappings due to severe feature interference among different triggers. To address this challenge, we propose MTAttack, the first multi-target backdoor attack framework for enforcing accurate multiple trigger-target mappings in LVLMs. The core of MTAttack is a novel optimization method with two constraints, namely Proxy Space Partitioning constraint and Trigger Prototype Anchoring constraint. It jointly optimizes multiple triggers in the latent space, with each trigger independently mapping clean images to a unique proxy class while at the same time guaranteeing their separability. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate a high success rate of MTAttack for multi-target attacks, substantially outperforming existing attack methods.

While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart. Our findings suggest that upgrading to more advanced language models when thoughtfully integrated, can lead to real improvements in how well we can analyze sentiments in text.

While recent Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods offer promising solutions, most rely on static target domain assumptions and input-invariant adaptation strategies, limiting their effectiveness under continual shifts. In this paper, we propose RobIA, a novel Robust, Instance-Aware framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in stereo depth estimation. RobIA integrates two key components: (1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE), a parameter-efficient module that dynamically routes input to frozen experts via lightweight self-attention mechanism tailored to epipolar geometry, and (2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher, a PEFT-based teacher model that provides dense pseudo-supervision by complementing sparse handcrafted labels. This strategy enables input-specific flexibility, broad supervision coverage, improving generalization under domain shift.

Recent methods primarily focus on leveraging additional prior knowledge and advanced multi-task architectures to achieve competitive performance. However, these pipelines rely on implicit modeling that uses frame-level or fragmented video features, failing to capture the temporal coherence across event sequences and comprehensive semantics within visual contexts. To address this, we propose an explicit temporal-semantic modeling framework called Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI), which leverages both latent temporal characteristics within videos and linguistic semantics from text corpus. Specifically, our model consists of two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent, event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval; and Context-aware Feature Enhancement utilizes query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics. Extensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets demonstrate that CACMI achieves the state-of-the-art performance on dense video captioning task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCACMI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5e27\u805a\u5408\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u9891\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e27\u7ea7\u6216\u788e\u7247\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f-\u8bed\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "CACMI\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5e27\u805a\u5408\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u5229\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u5f15\u5bfc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u4f2a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u5728ActivityNet Captions\u548cYouCook2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCACMI\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u9891\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CACMI\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u9891\u63cf\u8ff0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision.

This survey investigates this breakdown across three core primitives-negation, counting, and spatial relations. Our analysis reveals a dramatic performance collapse: models that are accurate on single primitives fail precipitously when these are combined, exposing severe interference. We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap.

The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language entropy is currently computationally infeasible. We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value. We show empirically that causal models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u71b5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f46\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6bcf\u8bcd\u5143\u71b5\u503c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\uff08\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u5143\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u662f\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u538b\u7f29\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u5b83\u4eec\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u71b5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u71b5\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u71b5\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u9002\u5ea6\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4\u56e0\u679c\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u3002\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bcf\u8bcd\u5143\u83b7\u5f97\u71b5\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f46\u4e0d\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u71b5\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5fc5\u7136\u8d85\u8fc7\u90a3\u4e9b\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u8d85\u8fc7\u6b64\u503c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u71b5\u503c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u71b5\u503c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u71b5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f46\u4e0d\u8d85\u51fa\u4f30\u8ba1\u71b5\u503c\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, the representational capacity of INR defined by the range of functions the neural network can characterize, is inherently limited by the low-dimensional feature space in conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures. While widening the MLP can linearly increase feature space dimensionality, it also leads to a quadratic growth in computational and memory costs. To address this limitation, we propose the split-layer, a novel reformulation of MLP construction. The split-layer divides each layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs via Hadamard product, effectively constructing a high-degree polynomial space. This approach significantly enhances INR's representational capacity by expanding the feature space dimensionality without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the split-layer substantially improves INR performance, surpassing existing methods across multiple tasks, including 2D image fitting, 2D CT reconstruction, 3D shape representation, and 5D novel view synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3asplit-layer\u7684\u65b0\u578bMLP\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6bcf\u5c42\u5206\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u5206\u652f\u5e76\u7528Hadamard\u4e58\u79ef\u6574\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6b21\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a(INR)\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a(MLP)\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u4e86INR\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u589e\u52a0MLP\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u589e\u957f\u3002", "method": "split-layer\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2aMLP\u5c42\u5206\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Hadamard\u4e58\u79ef\u6574\u5408\u5206\u652f\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6b21\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u57282D\u56fe\u50cf\u62df\u5408\u30012D CT\u91cd\u5efa\u30013D\u5f62\u72b6\u8868\u793a\u548c5D\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0csplit-layer\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86INR\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "split-layer\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86INR\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method.

In real-world scenarios, images often contain multiple degradations simultaneously, such as rain, noise, and haze, requiring models capable of handling diverse degradation types. Moreover, methods that improve performance through module stacking often suffer from limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability-driven approach for multi-degradation image restoration, built upon a deep unfolding network that maps the iterative process of a mathematical optimization algorithm into a learnable network structure. Specifically, we employ an improved second-order semi-smooth Newton algorithm to ensure that each module maintains clear physical interpretability. To further enhance interpretability and adaptability, we design an explainable convolution module inspired by the human brain's flexible information processing and the intrinsic characteristics of images, allowing the network to flexibly leverage learned knowledge and autonomously adjust parameters for different input.

However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system.

Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE.

Previous methods have predominantly employed diffusion models for high-fidelity reconstruction. However, their multi-step iterative sampling incurs significant computational overhead, limiting its real-time applicability. To address this, we propose LiNeXt-a lightweight, non-diffusion network optimized for rapid and accurate point cloud completion. Specifically, LiNeXt first applies the Noise-to-Coarse (N2C) Module to denoise the input noisy point cloud in a single pass, thereby obviating the multi-step iterative sampling of diffusion-based methods. The Refine Module then takes the coarse point cloud and its intermediate features from the N2C Module to perform more precise refinement, further enhancing structural completeness. Furthermore, we observe that LiDAR point clouds exhibit a distance-dependent spatial distribution, being densely sampled at proximal ranges and sparsely sampled at distal ranges. Accordingly, we propose the Distance-aware Selected Repeat strategy to generate a more uniformly distributed noisy point cloud. On the SemanticKITTI dataset, LiNeXt achieves a 199.8x speedup in inference, reduces Chamfer Distance by 50.7%, and uses only 6.1% of the parameters compared with LiDiff.

However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%).

However, as more agents participate, existing frameworks face two key challenges: (1) the participating agents are inherently multi-modal and heterogeneous, and (2) the collaborative framework must be scalable to accommodate new agents. The former requires effective cross-agent feature alignment to mitigate heterogeneity loss, while the latter renders full-parameter training impractical, highlighting the importance of scalable adaptation. To address these issues, we propose Heterogeneous Adaptation (HeatV2X), a scalable collaborative framework. We first train a high-performance agent based on heterogeneous graph attention as the foundation for collaborative learning. Then, we design Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning to achieve effective alignment and interaction among heterogeneous agents. The former efficiently extracts modality-specific differences using Hetero-Aware Adapters, while the latter employs the Multi-Cognitive Adapter to enhance cross-agent collaboration and fully exploit the fusion potential. These designs enable substantial performance improvement of the collaborative framework with minimal training cost. We evaluate our approach on the OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets.

Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers.

However, such approaches that target generalization require pretraining over real samples. Additionally, these methods primarily focus on detecting audio-visual inconsistencies and may overlook intra-modal artifacts causing them to fail against manipulations that preserve audio-visual alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage training framework that enhances generalization by incorporating next-frame prediction for both uni-modal and cross-modal features. Additionally, we introduce a window-level attention mechanism to capture discrepancies between predicted and actual frames, enabling the model to detect local artifacts around every frame, which is crucial for accurately classifying fully manipulated videos and effectively localizing deepfake segments in partially spoofed samples.

However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection.

In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios.

This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning.

However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction.

Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability. Meanwhile, existing AQA datasets also lack fine-grained annotations for action scores, especially for deduction items and sub-score annotations. In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy.

While audio-language research has progressed rapidly, music remains challenging due to its dynamic, layered, and information-dense nature. Progress has been further limited by the difficulty of scaling open audio understanding models, primarily because of the scarcity of high-quality music data and annotations. As a result, prior models are restricted to producing short, high-level captions, answering only surface-level questions, and showing limited generalization across diverse musical cultures. To address these challenges, we curate MF-Skills, a large-scale dataset labeled through a multi-stage pipeline that yields rich captions and question-answer pairs covering harmony, structure, timbre, lyrics, and cultural context. We fine-tune an enhanced Audio Flamingo 3 backbone on MF-Skills and further strengthen multiple skills relevant to music understanding. To improve the model's reasoning abilities, we introduce a post-training recipe: we first cold-start with MF-Think, a novel chain-of-thought dataset grounded in music theory, followed by GRPO-based reinforcement learning with custom rewards. Music Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art results across 10+ benchmarks for music understanding and reasoning, establishing itself as a generalist and musically intelligent audio-language model. Beyond strong empirical results, Music Flamingo sets a new standard for advanced music understanding by demonstrating how models can move from surface-level recognition toward layered, human-like perception of songs.

The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion. Third, we design a data synthesis pipeline that iteratively leverages the prior stages to expand the training dataset, enabling scalable self-improvement of the model. Built upon this framework, we introduce FEA-20K, a benchmark dataset comprising 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples with fine-grained emotion analysis annotations.

To investigate these mechanisms, we model large language model (LLM) personas as synthetic agents that mimic user-level biases, ideological alignments, and trust heuristics. Within this setup, we introduce an auditor--node framework to simulate and analyze how misinformation evolves as it circulates through networks of such agents. News articles are propagated across networks of persona-conditioned LLM nodes, each rewriting received content. A question--answering-based auditor then measures factual fidelity at every step, offering interpretable, claim-level tracking of misinformation drift. We formalize a misinformation index and a misinformation propagation rate to quantify factual degradation across homogeneous and heterogeneous branches of up to 30 sequential rewrites. Experiments with 21 personas across 10 domains reveal that identity- and ideology-based personas act as misinformation accelerators, especially in politics, marketing, and technology. By contrast, expert-driven personas preserve factual stability. Controlled-random branch simulations further show that once early distortions emerge, heterogeneous persona interactions rapidly escalate misinformation to propaganda-level distortion.

Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of our H3Former framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "H3Former\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u9636\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u7684token-to-region\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u6216\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u8bae\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5224\u522b\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u91cf\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faH3Former\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757(SAAM)\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931(HHCL)\u3002SAAM\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ebf\u7d22\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efatoken\u95f4\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u8d85\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u6355\u83b7\u9ad8\u9636\u8bed\u4e49\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff1bHHCL\u5728\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5c42\u6b21\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6FGVC\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86H3Former\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "H3Former\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u9636\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u805a\u5408\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u7ec6\u5fae\u548c\u7c7b\u5185\u53d8\u5316\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Existing post-training paradigms are limited: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) relies on costly step-level annotations, while Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods like GRPO provide only sparse, outcome-level feedback, hindering stable optimization. We introduce PROPA (Process-level Reasoning Optimization with interleaved Policy Alignment), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GRPO to generate dense, process-level rewards and optimize reasoning at each intermediate step without human annotations. To overcome the cold-start problem, PROPA interleaves GRPO updates with SFT, enabling the model to learn from both successful and failed reasoning trajectories. A Process Reward Model (PRM) is further trained to guide inference-time search, aligning the test-time search with the training signal. Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines. It achieves up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art, establishing a strong reasoning and generalization capability for visual reasoning tasks.

Advances in large language models (LLMs) have established LLM-based agents as a major branch of MAS, enabling major breakthroughs in complex problem solving and world modeling. However, the reliability implications of this shift remain largely unexplored. i.e., whether substituting traditional agents with LLM-based agents can effectively enhance the reliability of MAS. In this work, we investigate and quantify the reliability of LLM-based agents from the perspective of Byzantine fault tolerance. We observe that LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism when processing erroneous message flows, a characteristic that enables them to outperform traditional agents across different topological structures. Motivated by the results of the pilot experiment, we design CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to enhance the stability of MAS with different topologies. It capitalizes on the intrinsic reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLMs by employing a probe-based, weighted information flow transmission method to improve the reliability of LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-WBFT achieves superior performance across diverse network topologies under extreme Byzantine conditions (85.7\\% fault rate).

Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context.

However, the morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements presents a major challenge, hindering the ability of models trained on specific regions to generalize effectively to unseen locations. To address this, we introduce a large-scale high-resolution dataset and propose GRAM (Generalized Region-Aware Mixture-of-Experts), a two-phase test-time adaptation framework that enables robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions. We compile a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents for source training. Using this dataset, the model employs a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to capture region-specific slum characteristics while learning universal features through a shared backbone. During adaptation, prediction consistency across experts filters out unreliable pseudo-labels, allowing the model to generalize effectively to previously unseen regions.

Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work.

To this end, we present LLaViT - Large Language Models as extended Vision Transformers - which enables the LLM to simultaneously function as a vision encoder through three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations.

However, the current performance benchmarks exhibit weaknesses. The currently applied metrics for various subsets of a validation dataset prohibit a realistic performance evaluation of a DNN for pedestrian detection. As image segmentation supplies fine-grained information about a street scene, it can serve as a starting point to automatically distinguish between different types of errors during the evaluation of a pedestrian detector. In this work, eight different error categories for pedestrian detection are proposed and new metrics are proposed for performance comparison along these error categories. We use the new metrics to compare various backbones for a simplified version of the APD, and show a more fine-grained and robust way to compare models with each other especially in terms of safety-critical performance.

Then, the IFE is proposed to rectify the feature embeddings of infrared images using the generated text semantics. This process injects id-related semantics into the shared image encoder, enhancing its adaptability to the infrared modality. Besides, with text serving as a bridge, it enables indirect visible-infrared modality alignment. Finally, the HSA is established to refine the high-level semantic alignment. This process ensures that the fine-tuned text semantics only contain id-related information, thereby achieving more accurate cross-modal alignment and enhancing the discriminability of the learned modal-shared representations.

By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset.

Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations.

While recent methods like CLIP-based semantic augmentation have shown promise, they often overlook the underlying structure of feature distributions and frequency-domain characteristics that are critical for robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances SDG object detection by integrating the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and Fourier transformation into a CLIP-guided pipeline. Specifically, we model the directional features of object representations using vMF to better capture domain-invariant semantic structures in the embedding space.

Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification. Results reveal that none of the current methods maintains their protective effectiveness under such threats. These findings highlight that current defenses offer a false sense of security and underscore the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protections to safeguard user identity in personalized generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u9488\u5bf9DreamBooth\u7b49\u4e2a\u6027\u5316AI\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u6cc4\u9732\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AntiDB_Purify\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u51c0\u5316\u5a01\u80c1\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "DreamBooth\u7b49\u4e2a\u6027\u5316AI\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u8eab\u4efd\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982Anti-DreamBooth\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u6210\u529f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AntiDB_Purify\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u51c0\u5316\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u51c0\u5316\u5a01\u80c1\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6240\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c0\u5316\u5a01\u80c1\u4e0b\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u865a\u5047\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u8eab\u4efd\u5b89\u5168\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a physics-informed Transformer-VAE architecture to invert the PROSAIL radiative transfer model for simultaneous estimation of key canopy parameters from Sentinel-2 data.

Our model is trained exclusively on simulated data, yet achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods that utilize real imagery. The Transformer-VAE incorporates the PROSAIL model as a differentiable physical decoder, ensuring that inferred latent variables correspond to physically plausible leaf and canopy properties. We demonstrate retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) on real-world field datasets (FRM4Veg and BelSAR) with accuracy comparable to models trained with real Sentinel-2 data. Our method requires no in-situ labels or calibration on real images, offering a cost-effective and self-supervised solution for global vegetation monitoring.

However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations.

Such data models cannot be directly measured by sensors and are typically generated from Digital Surface Models (DSMs) derived from LiDAR or photogrammetry. Traditional filtering approaches rely on manually tuned parameters, while learning-based methods require well-designed architectures, often combined with post-processing. To address these challenges, we introduce Ground Diffusion (GrounDiff), the first diffusion-based framework that iteratively removes non-ground structures by formulating the problem as a denoising task. We incorporate a gated design with confidence-guided generation that enables selective filtering. To increase scalability, we further propose Prior-Guided Stitching (PrioStitch), which employs a downsampled global prior automatically generated using GrounDiff to guide local high-resolution predictions. We evaluate our method on the DSM-to-DTM translation task across diverse datasets, showing that GrounDiff consistently outperforms deep learning-based state-of-the-art methods, reducing RMSE by up to 93% on ALS2DTM and up to 47% on USGS benchmarks. In the task of road reconstruction, which requires both high precision and smoothness, our method achieves up to 81% lower distance error compared to specialized techniques on the GeRoD benchmark, while maintaining competitive surface smoothness using only DSM inputs, without task-specific optimization. Our variant for road reconstruction, GrounDiff+, is specifically designed to produce even smoother surfaces, further surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

To address these limitations, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines YOLOMS with a large language model (LLM) for intelligent fault analysis and diagnosis. Specifically, YOLOMS employs multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping to enhance fault feature extraction, while a lightweight key-value (KV) mapping module bridges the gap between visual outputs and textual inputs. This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations.

Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability.

Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason.

Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients.

Compact attention representations, reflecting token interaction distributions, can guide early detection and reduction of less salient tokens prior to attention computation. Motivated by this, we present SParsification with attentiOn dynamics via Token relevance (SPOT), a framework for early detection of redundant tokens within ViTs that leverages token embeddings, interactions, and attention dynamics across layers to infer token importance, resulting in a more context-aware and interpretable relevance detection process. SPOT informs token sparsification and facilitates the elimination of such tokens, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. SPOT employs computationally lightweight predictors that can be plugged into various ViT architectures and learn to derive effective input-specific token prioritization across layers.

The pipeline is trained end-to-end so that reconstruction and regularization are optimized jointly, yielding spatially adaptive smoothing: strong in homogeneous regions, relaxed near anatomical boundaries.

In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA", "AI": {"tldr": "SemanticVLA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u6307\u4ee4-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u611f\u77e5\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u5173\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff1b2\uff09\u6d45\u5c42\u7684\u6307\u4ee4-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u89c6\u89c9\u526a\u679d\u5668\uff08SD-Pruner\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\uff1b2\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u878d\u5408\u5668\uff08SH-Fuser\uff09\u878d\u5408\u5bc6\u96c6\u8865\u4e01\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b3\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8026\u5408\u5668\uff08SA-Coupler\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSemanticVLA\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684SOTA\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u5728LIBERO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSemanticVLA\u6bd4OpenVLA\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8621.1%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e863.0\u500d\u548c2.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "SemanticVLA\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

This work introduces a framework to address the need for robust diversity evaluation in T2I models. Our framework systematically assesses diversity by evaluating individual concepts and their relevant factors of variation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel human evaluation template for nuanced diversity assessment; (2) a curated prompt set covering diverse concepts with their identified factors of variation (e.g. prompt: An image of an apple, factor of variation: color); and (3) a methodology for comparing models in terms of human annotations via binomial tests.\n  Furthermore, we rigorously compare various image embeddings for diversity measurement.

Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5230\u98ce\u683c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u98ce\u683c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u65b0\u9896\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u65b9\u6cd5CoTyle\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5197\u957f\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u521b\u610f\u6709\u9650\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u793a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u591a\u6837\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u79bb\u6563\u98ce\u683c\u7801\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u7136\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u65b0\u9896\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u98ce\u683c\u4ee3\u7801\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u552f\u4e00\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u5e94\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1CoTyle\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u6570\u503c\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e00\u4e2a\u98ce\u683c\u786e\u5b9e\u503c\u5f97\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u521b\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u5230\u98ce\u683c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CoTyle\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u6700\u5c0f\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u827a\u672f\u521b\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models.

To address data scarcity, existing methods attempt to reuse 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM) models by either flattening DBT volumes or processing slices individually, thus discarding volumetric information. Alternatively, 3D reasoning approaches introduce complex architectures that require more DBT training data. Tackling these drawbacks, we propose M&M-3D, an architecture that enables learnable 3D reasoning while remaining parameter-free relative to its FFDM counterpart, M&M. M&M-3D constructs malignancy-guided 3D features, and 3D reasoning is learned through repeatedly mixing these 3D features with slice-level information. This is achieved by modifying operations in M&M without adding parameters, thus enabling direct weight transfer from FFDM.

First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency.

LUA integrates as a drop-in component, requiring no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages, and enables high-resolution synthesis through a single feed-forward pass in latent space. A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder.

In pursuit of minimal modeling, DA3 yields two key insights: a single plain transformer (e.g., vanilla DINO encoder) is sufficient as a backbone without architectural specialization, and a singular depth-ray prediction target obviates the need for complex multi-task learning. Through our teacher-student training paradigm, the model achieves a level of detail and generalization on par with Depth Anything 2 (DA2). We establish a new visual geometry benchmark covering camera pose estimation, any-view geometry and visual rendering.

In the multiple-choice setting - a dominant format for multimodal reasoning benchmarks - the paradigm faces a significant yet often overlooked obstacle: unfaithful trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which is a flaw that cannot be ignored. We propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) to correct this issue. For each question, SCS (i) introduces small visual perturbations and (ii) performs repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory; agreement among the resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates. Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, plugging SCS into RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation. SCS also yields notable gains on both Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u6d3d\u91c7\u6837(SCS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u731c\u6d4b\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u8f68\u8ff9\u83b7\u5f97\u76f8\u540c\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6570\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u969c\u788d\uff1a\u5373\u4f7f\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u9519\u8bef\u4f46\u6700\u7ec8\u731c\u5bf9\u9009\u9879\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e0e\u771f\u6b63\u6b63\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u83b7\u5f97\u76f8\u540c\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u81ea\u6d3d\u91c7\u6837(SCS)\uff1a\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898(i)\u5f15\u5165\u5c0f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6270\u52a8\uff0c(ii)\u91cd\u590d\u622a\u65ad\u548c\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u521d\u59cb\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u679c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u5fae\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c06SCS\u96c6\u6210\u5230RLOO\u3001GRPO\u548cREINFORCE++\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe7.7\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002\u5728Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct\u548cInternVL3-8B\u4e0a\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "SCS\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While flow-based models are fast, they often produce geometrically inaccurate structures, as they have difficulty capturing the multimodal distributions of molecular conformations. In contrast, denoising diffusion models are more accurate but suffer from slow sampling, a limitation attributed to sub-optimal integration between diffusion dynamics and SE(3)-equivariant architectures. To address this, we propose VEDA, a unified SE(3)-equivariant framework that combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to efficiently generate conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures. Specifically, our key technical contributions include: (1) a VE schedule that enables noise injection functionally analogous to simulated annealing, improving 3D accuracy and reducing relaxation energy; (2) a novel preconditioning scheme that reconciles the coordinate-predicting nature of SE(3)-equivariant networks with a residual-based diffusion objective, and (3) a new arcsin-based scheduler that concentrates sampling in critical intervals of the logarithmic signal-to-noise ratio. On the QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets, VEDA matches the sampling efficiency of flow-based models, achieving state-of-the-art valency stability and validity with only 100 sampling steps. More importantly, VEDA's generated structures are remarkably stable, as measured by their relaxation energy during GFN2-xTB optimization. The median energy change is only 1.72 kcal/mol, significantly lower than the 32.3 kcal/mol from its architectural baseline, SemlaFlow.

AI cognitive assistants, acting as virtual partners, have the potential to ease this burden by supporting real-time data collection and decision making. In pursuit of this vision, we introduce EgoEMS, the first end-to-end, high-fidelity, multimodal, multiperson dataset capturing over 20 hours of realistic, procedural EMS activities from an egocentric view in 233 simulated emergency scenarios performed by 62 participants, including 46 EMS professionals. Developed in collaboration with EMS experts and aligned with national standards, EgoEMS is captured using an open-source, low-cost, and replicable data collection system and is annotated with keysteps, timestamped audio transcripts with speaker diarization, action quality metrics, and bounding boxes with segmentation masks.

As dataset size increases, this bias drives generation toward overly smooth, homogeneous samples, reducing intra-class diversity and limiting generalization. We present PRISM (PRIors from diverse Source Models), a framework that disentangles architectural priors during synthesis. PRISM decouples the logit-matching and regularization objectives, supervising them with different teacher architectures: a primary model for logits and a stochastic subset for batch-normalization (BN) alignment. On ImageNet-1K, PRISM consistently and reproducibly outperforms single-teacher methods (e.g., SRe2L) and recent multi-teacher variants (e.g., G-VBSM) at low- and mid-IPC regimes. The generated data also show significantly richer intra-class diversity, as reflected by a notable drop in cosine similarity between features. We further analyze teacher selection strategies (pre- vs. intra-distillation) and introduce a scalable cross-class batch formation scheme for fast parallel synthesis.

However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain.

Our focus centers on refining and evaluating CNN-based approaches for precise and efficient ROP detection. We navigate the complexities of dataset curation, preprocessing strategies, and model architecture, aligning with research objectives encompassing model effectiveness, computational cost analysis, and time complexity assessment. Results underscore the supremacy of tailored CNN models over pre-trained counterparts, evident in heightened accuracy and F1-scores. Implementation of a voting system further enhances performance.

In this paper, we show a new black-box model-agnostic adversarial attack for post-hoc explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), particularly in the image domain. The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet. The results show that our attacks could lead to dramatically different explanations without changing the predictive probabilities.

This, however, disregards the presence of redundant examples and inherent differences in the learning difficulties of classes. Alternatively, one can use complex measures such as training loss and uncertainty, which, however, depend on training a machine learning model. Our paper proposes using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as an easy-to-compute, model-free measure of imbalance that can be seamlessly incorporated into various imbalance mitigation methods. Our results across five different datasets with a diverse range of imbalance ratios show that ID consistently outperforms cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling techniques used in the literature. Moreover, we show that combining ID with cardinality can further improve performance.

As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5339\u914d\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4eff\u771f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u91cd\u73b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f25\u8865sim-to-real\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4eff\u771f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Scenic\u6982\u7387\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u62bd\u8c61\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5339\u914d\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u7b26\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u968f\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u957f\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4eff\u771f\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eff\u771f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u9a8c\u8bc1\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}
