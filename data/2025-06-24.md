### [1] [Outcome-Based Education: Evaluating Students' Perspectives Using Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17223)
*Shuvra Smaran Das,Anirban Saha Anik,Md Kishor Morol,Mohammad Sakib Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究使用DistilBERT和LIME分析学生反馈，以改进基于成果的教育（OBE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过深度理解语言上下文，提升学生反馈的情感分类准确性，从而更好地实现OBE的可测量目标。

Method: 采用DistilBERT模型分析NLP数据集，并结合LIME解释模型预测。

Result: 结合Transformer模型和LIME的解释能力，构建了一个强大且直观的学生反馈分析框架。

Conclusion: 该方法更符合OBE原则，通过数据驱动提升教育实践。

Abstract: Outcome-Based Education (OBE) emphasizes the development of specific
competencies through student-centered learning. In this study, we reviewed the
importance of OBE and implemented transformer-based models, particularly
DistilBERT, to analyze an NLP dataset that includes student feedback. Our
objective is to assess and improve educational outcomes. Our approach is better
than other machine learning models because it uses the transformer's deep
understanding of language context to classify sentiment better, giving better
results across a wider range of matrices. Our work directly contributes to
OBE's goal of achieving measurable outcomes by facilitating the identification
of patterns in student learning experiences. We have also applied LIME (local
interpretable model-agnostic explanations) to make sure that model predictions
are clear. This gives us understandable information about how key terms affect
sentiment. Our findings indicate that the combination of transformer models and
LIME explanations results in a strong and straightforward framework for
analyzing student feedback. This aligns more closely with the principles of OBE
and ensures the improvement of educational practices through data-driven
insights.

### [2] [Efficient and Stealthy Jailbreak Attacks via Adversarial Prompt Distillation from LLMs to SLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17231)
*Xiang Li,Chong Zhang,Jia Wang,Fangyu Wu,Yushi Li,Xiaobo Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Adversarial Prompt Distillation的方法，通过结合掩码语言建模、强化学习和动态温度控制，使小型语言模型（SLMs）能够对主流大型语言模型（LLMs）进行越狱攻击。该方法在攻击成功率和危害性方面表现优越，同时具有资源效率和跨模型适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前越狱攻击方法存在效率低、计算成本高、跨模型适应性和通用性差等问题，难以应对LLM的快速发展和新防御策略。

Method: 结合掩码语言建模、强化学习和动态温度控制，通过提示生成和蒸馏方法，使SLMs能够对LLMs进行越狱攻击。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在攻击成功率和危害性方面的优越性，同时体现了资源效率和跨模型适应性。

Conclusion: 研究探索了将LLM的越狱能力蒸馏到SLM的可行性，揭示了模型的脆弱性，为LLM安全研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Attacks on large language models (LLMs) in jailbreaking scenarios raise many
security and ethical issues. Current jailbreak attack methods face problems
such as low efficiency, high computational cost, and poor cross-model
adaptability and versatility, which make it difficult to cope with the rapid
development of LLM and new defense strategies. Our work proposes an Adversarial
Prompt Distillation, which combines masked language modeling, reinforcement
learning, and dynamic temperature control through a prompt generation and
distillation method. It enables small language models (SLMs) to jailbreak
attacks on mainstream LLMs. The experimental results verify the superiority of
the proposed method in terms of attack success rate and harm, and reflect the
resource efficiency and cross-model adaptability. This research explores the
feasibility of distilling the jailbreak ability of LLM to SLM, reveals the
model's vulnerability, and provides a new idea for LLM security research.

### [3] [GTA: Grouped-head latenT Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17286)
*Luoyang Sun,Jiwen Jiang,Cheng Deng,Xinjian Wu,Haifeng Zhang,Lei Chen,Lionel Ni,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GTA是一种新型注意力机制，通过共享注意力图和压缩值缓存，显著减少计算和内存开销，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的注意力机制存在计算和内存开销大的问题，限制了在资源有限硬件上的部署效率。

Method: GTA包含共享注意力图机制和非线性值解码器，分别减少键缓存大小和压缩值缓存。

Result: GTA减少计算FLOPs达62.5%，压缩KV缓存70%，推理速度提升2倍。

Conclusion: GTA显著优化了LLM的计算和内存效率，提升了部署性能。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the success of large language models (LLMs),
yet their substantial computational and memory overhead poses challenges for
optimizing efficiency and performance. A critical bottleneck arises as KV cache
and attention computations scale rapidly with text length, challenging
deployment on hardware with limited computational and memory resources. We
observe that attention mechanisms exhibit substantial redundancy, since the KV
cache can be significantly compressed and attention maps across heads display
high similarity, revealing that much of the computation and storage is
unnecessary. Leveraging these insights, we propose \textbf{G}rouped-Head
Laten\textbf{T} \textbf{A}ttention (GTA), a novel attention mechanism that
reduces memory usage and computational complexity while maintaining
performance. GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism
that reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache
size; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that
compresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs.
GTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \emph{62.5\%} versus
Grouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \emph{70\%}, all while
avoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM
deployment efficiency. Consequently, GTA models achieve a \emph{2x} increase in
end-to-end inference speed, with prefill benefiting from reduced computational
cost and decoding benefiting from the smaller cache footprint.

### [5] [Semantic uncertainty in advanced decoding methods for LLM generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17296)
*Darius Foodeei,Simin Fan,Martin Jaggi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了不同解码方法对LLM输出的语义不确定性的影响，发现结构化方法（如CoT解码）能提高多样性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是分析不同解码策略如何影响语言模型输出的多样性和可靠性，以优化实际应用中的性能。

Method: 通过问答、摘要和代码生成任务实验，比较了CoT解码和推测采样等方法的效果。

Result: 结果显示CoT解码提高了语义多样性并降低预测熵，代码生成Pass@2率提升48.8%；推测采样在摘要任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 结论表明结构化解码方法可在保持或提升输出质量的同时增加语义探索，对实际应用有重要意义。

Abstract: This study investigates semantic uncertainty in large language model (LLM)
outputs across different decoding methods, focusing on emerging techniques like
speculative sampling and chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding. Through experiments
on question answering, summarization, and code generation tasks, we analyze how
different decoding strategies affect both the diversity and reliability of
model outputs. Our findings reveal that while CoT decoding demonstrates higher
semantic diversity, it maintains lower predictive entropy, suggesting that
structured exploration can lead to more confident and accurate outputs. This is
evidenced by a 48.8% improvement in code generation Pass@2 rates, despite lower
alignment with reference solutions. For summarization tasks, speculative
sampling proved particularly effective, achieving superior ROUGE scores while
maintaining moderate semantic diversity. Our results challenge conventional
assumptions about trade-offs between diversity and accuracy in language model
outputs, demonstrating that properly structured decoding methods can increase
semantic exploration while maintaining or improving output quality. These
findings have significant implications for deploying language models in
practical applications where both reliability and diverse solution generation
are crucial.

### [8] [Towards Safety Evaluations of Theory of Mind in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17352)
*Tatsuhiro Aoshima,Mitsuaki Akiyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的安全评估问题，重点关注其潜在欺骗行为，并提出通过测量LLMs的心智理论能力来评估风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs能力的提升，其安全评估变得尤为重要，尤其是模型可能表现出欺骗行为，需要研究这些行为是否源于模型的隐蔽意图。

Method: 通过回顾心智理论相关研究，分析其在安全评估中的应用，并评估一系列开源LLMs的心智理论能力发展情况。

Result: 研究发现，尽管LLMs的阅读理解能力有所提升，但其心智理论能力并未同步发展。

Conclusion: 论文总结了当前LLMs心智理论能力在安全评估中的现状，并提出了未来研究的挑战。

Abstract: As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the
importance of rigorous safety evaluation is becoming increasingly evident.
Recent concerns within the realm of safety assessment have highlighted
instances in which LLMs exhibit behaviors that appear to disable oversight
mechanisms and respond in a deceptive manner. For example, there have been
reports suggesting that, when confronted with information unfavorable to their
own persistence during task execution, LLMs may act covertly and even provide
false answers to questions intended to verify their behavior.To evaluate the
potential risk of such deceptive actions toward developers or users, it is
essential to investigate whether these behaviors stem from covert, intentional
processes within the model. In this study, we propose that it is necessary to
measure the theory of mind capabilities of LLMs. We begin by reviewing existing
research on theory of mind and identifying the perspectives and tasks relevant
to its application in safety evaluation. Given that theory of mind has been
predominantly studied within the context of developmental psychology, we
analyze developmental trends across a series of open-weight LLMs. Our results
indicate that while LLMs have improved in reading comprehension, their theory
of mind capabilities have not shown comparable development. Finally, we present
the current state of safety evaluation with respect to LLMs' theory of mind,
and discuss remaining challenges for future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现当前大语言模型（LLMs）在权衡金钱与用户舒适度时存在不一致性和不合理性，质疑其作为决策助手的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在涉及金钱与用户舒适度权衡的决策场景中的表现，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过量化多个LLMs对用户不适（如额外步行、等待、饥饿和疼痛）的定价，分析其决策行为。

Result: 发现LLMs在决策中存在显著差异、对提示语微小变化的脆弱性、对不合理低报酬的接受以及对无不适场景下拒绝高报酬等问题。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在权衡金钱与舒适度时表现不稳定，需进一步审查其决策逻辑，尤其是在涉及用户利益的场景中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed as near-autonomous
artificial intelligence (AI) agents capable of making everyday decisions on
behalf of humans. Although LLMs perform well on many technical tasks, their
behaviour in personal decision-making remains less understood. Previous studies
have assessed their rationality and moral alignment with human decisions.
However, the behaviour of AI assistants in scenarios where financial rewards
are at odds with user comfort has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this
paper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple
LLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and
pain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of
using current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in
responses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to
minor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the
first person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept
unreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10
hours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed
(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for
scrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward
applications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users'
behalf.

Motivation: 现有研究难以大规模识别辅导行为对学习的影响，本研究旨在利用AI解决这一问题。

Method: 分析了50份大学辅导中学生数学的录音，使用多种生成式AI模型评估辅导技能（如表扬和错误响应）。

Result: 模型在检测表扬（94-98%准确率）和错误（82-88%准确率）方面表现良好，与人类判断一致性高（83-89%和73-77%）。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可用于大规模辅导行为评估，研究提供了低成本提示策略，支持AI辅助学习的可重复研究。

Abstract: Tutoring improves student achievement, but identifying and studying what
tutoring actions are most associated with student learning at scale based on
audio transcriptions is an open research problem. This present study
investigates the feasibility and scalability of using generative AI to identify
and evaluate specific tutor moves in real-life math tutoring. We analyze 50
randomly selected transcripts of college-student remote tutors assisting middle
school students in mathematics. Using GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo,
Gemini-1.5-pro, and LearnLM, we assess tutors' application of two tutor skills:
delivering effective praise and responding to student math errors. All models
reliably detected relevant situations, for example, tutors providing praise to
students (94-98% accuracy) and a student making a math error (82-88% accuracy)
and effectively evaluated the tutors' adherence to tutoring best practices,
aligning closely with human judgments (83-89% and 73-77%, respectively). We
propose a cost-effective prompting strategy and discuss practical implications
for using large language models to support scalable assessment in authentic
settings. This work further contributes LLM prompts to support reproducibility
and research in AI-supported learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种信息论框架UProp，用于量化LLM在序列决策中的不确定性，包括内部和外部不确定性，并在实验中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM应用于安全关键领域，需要量化其决策不确定性，但现有方法主要针对单轮问答，序列决策场景研究不足。

Method: 提出信息论框架，将不确定性分解为内部和外部（互信息），并设计UProp方法估计外部不确定性。

Result: UProp在多步决策基准测试中显著优于现有单轮UQ方法，并分析了其采样效率和应用潜力。

Conclusion: UProp有效解决了LLM序列决策中的不确定性量化问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into safety-critical
applications involving sequential decision-making in the real world, it is
essential to know when to trust LLM decisions. Existing LLM Uncertainty
Quantification (UQ) methods are primarily designed for single-turn
question-answering formats, resulting in multi-step decision-making scenarios,
e.g., LLM agentic system, being underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a
principled, information-theoretic framework that decomposes LLM sequential
decision uncertainty into two parts: (i) internal uncertainty intrinsic to the
current decision, which is focused on existing UQ methods, and (ii) extrinsic
uncertainty, a Mutual-Information (MI) quantity describing how much uncertainty
should be inherited from preceding decisions. We then propose UProp, an
efficient and effective extrinsic uncertainty estimator that converts the
direct estimation of MI to the estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)
over multiple Trajectory-Dependent Decision Processes (TDPs). UProp is
evaluated over extensive multi-step decision-making benchmarks, e.g.,
AgentBench and HotpotQA, with state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3. Experimental results demonstrate that UProp significantly
outperforms existing single-turn UQ baselines equipped with thoughtful
aggregation strategies. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of UProp,
including sampling efficiency, potential applications, and intermediate
uncertainty propagation, to demonstrate its effectiveness. Codes will be
available at https://github.com/jinhaoduan/UProp.

TL;DR: 评估大语言模型（LLM）仅通过URL分类政治内容（PC）的能力，发现URL能有效嵌入新闻内容，提供准确性与成本的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在政治科学中仅通过URL分类PC的潜力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用GPT、Llama等先进LLM，比较URL与全文分析的效果，并与人工标注和传统机器学习方法对比。

Result: URL能有效嵌入新闻内容，为准确性与成本提供平衡。

Conclusion: LLM在URL级分析中表现良好，为政治科学研究提供了实用建议。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) is becoming common in the context of
political science, particularly in studies that analyse individuals use of
digital media. However, while previous research has demonstrated LLMs ability
at labelling tasks, the effectiveness of using LLMs to classify political
content (PC) from just URLs is not yet well explored. The work presented in
this article bridges this gap by evaluating whether LLMs can accurately
identify PC vs. non-PC from both the article text and the URLs from five
countries (France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the US) and different languages.
Using cutting-edge LLMs like GPT, Llama, Mistral, Deepseek, Qwen and Gemma, we
measure model performance to assess whether URL-level analysis can be a good
approximation for full-text analysis of PC, even across different linguistic
and national contexts. Model outputs are compared with human-labelled articles,
as well as traditional supervised machine learning techniques, to set a
baseline of performance. Overall, our findings suggest the capacity of URLs to
embed most of the news content, providing a vital perspective on accuracy-cost
balancing. We also account for contextual limitations and suggest
methodological recommendations to use LLMs within political science studies.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has reached impressive accuracy for
high-resource languages, yet its utility in linguistic fieldwork remains
limited. Recordings collected in fieldwork contexts present unique challenges,
including spontaneous speech, environmental noise, and severely constrained
datasets from under-documented languages. In this paper, we benchmark the
performance of two fine-tuned multilingual ASR models, MMS and XLS-R, on five
typologically diverse low-resource languages with control of training data
duration. Our findings show that MMS is best suited when extremely small
amounts of training data are available, whereas XLS-R shows parity performance
once training data exceed one hour. We provide linguistically grounded analysis
for further provide insights towards practical guidelines for field linguists,
highlighting reproducible ASR adaptation approaches to mitigate the
transcription bottleneck in language documentation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential to change how
we write, communicate, and create, leading to rapid adoption across society.
This dissertation examines how individuals and institutions are adapting to and
engaging with this emerging technology through three research directions.
First, I demonstrate how the institutional adoption of AI detectors introduces
systematic biases, particularly disadvantaging writers of non-dominant language
varieties, highlighting critical equity concerns in AI governance. Second, I
present novel population-level algorithmic approaches that measure the
increasing adoption of LLMs across writing domains, revealing consistent
patterns of AI-assisted content in academic peer reviews, scientific
publications, consumer complaints, corporate communications, job postings, and
international organization press releases. Finally, I investigate LLMs'
capability to provide feedback on research manuscripts through a large-scale
empirical analysis, offering insights into their potential to support
researchers who face barriers in accessing timely manuscript feedback,
particularly early-career researchers and those from under-resourced settings.

Conclusion: VeriLocc提供了一种通用且高效的寄存器分配方法，显著优于传统手工调优方法。

Abstract: Modern GPUs evolve rapidly, yet production compilers still rely on
hand-crafted register allocation heuristics that require substantial re-tuning
for each hardware generation. We introduce VeriLocc, a framework that combines
large language models (LLMs) with formal compiler techniques to enable
generalizable and verifiable register allocation across GPU architectures.
VeriLocc fine-tunes an LLM to translate intermediate representations (MIRs)
into target-specific register assignments, aided by static analysis for
cross-architecture normalization and generalization and a verifier-guided
regeneration loop to ensure correctness. Evaluated on matrix multiplication
(GEMM) and multi-head attention (MHA), VeriLocc achieves 85-99% single-shot
accuracy and near-100% pass@100. Case study shows that VeriLocc discovers more
performant assignments than expert-tuned libraries, outperforming rocBLAS by
over 10% in runtime.

TL;DR: 对三个多语言语音数据集（Mozilla Common Voice 17.0、FLEURS和VoxPopuli）的质量审计显示，某些语言存在显著质量问题，需改进以提升模型训练和评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示多语言语音数据集的质量问题，尤其是资源较少语言，以推动数据集改进和下游模型性能提升。

Method: 将质量问题分为微观和宏观两类，并以台湾闽南语（nan_tw）为例进行案例分析。

Result: 发现宏观问题在资源较少语言中更普遍，需加强语言规划和数据质量控制。

Conclusion: 提出未来数据集开发的指南和建议，强调社会语言学意识对创建可靠语音数据的重要性。

Abstract: Our quality audit for three widely used public multilingual speech datasets -
Mozilla Common Voice 17.0, FLEURS, and VoxPopuli - shows that in some
languages, these datasets suffer from significant quality issues. We believe
addressing these issues will make these datasets more useful as training and
evaluation sets, and improve downstream models. We divide these quality issues
into two categories: micro-level and macro-level. We find that macro-level
issues are more prevalent in less institutionalized, often under-resourced
languages. We provide a case analysis of Taiwanese Southern Min (nan_tw) that
highlights the need for proactive language planning (e.g. orthography
prescriptions, dialect boundary definition) and enhanced data quality control
in the process of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset creation. We
conclude by proposing guidelines and recommendations to mitigate these issues
in future dataset development, emphasizing the importance of sociolinguistic
awareness in creating robust and reliable speech data resources.

TL;DR: DuaShepherd是一个新的奖励建模框架，结合正确性和潜力两种奖励信号，提升大语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型通常只关注正确性或潜力，而结合两者可以更全面地提升模型性能。

Method: 开发自动化管道构建大规模奖励建模数据集，采用多任务学习的多头架构并行训练两种奖励模型。

Result: 在MATH500和ProcessBench上的实验表明，结合两种奖励信号的模型性能显著优于单一奖励模型。

Conclusion: DuaShepherd通过结合正确性和潜力奖励信号，实现了在资源限制下的最优性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose DuaShepherd, a novel reward modeling framework that
integrates two complementary reward signals, correctness and potential, to
enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While correctness-based signals emphasize identification of stepwise
errors, potential-based signals focus on the likelihood of reaching the correct
final answer. We developed an automated pipeline for constructing large-scale
reward modeling dataset with both signals. A unified, multi-head architecture
was explored to train the two reward models in a multi-task setup,
demonstrating benefits from learning both correctness and potential in
parallel. By combining these two signals into a compound probability, our model
achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple benchmarks.
Empirical evaluations on MATH500 and ProcessBench confirm that this combined
reward significantly outperforms models trained on either reward type alone,
achieving state-of-the-art performance under comparable resource constraints.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了自监督学习（SSL）模型如何编码影响口音感知的音系特征，发现特定音段的自监督表示特征能最佳预测口音强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统口音感知模型低估了音系特征的梯度变化对听者口音判断的影响，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用CSLU Foreign Accented English语料库，结合Phonet提取音系特征概率，并利用Wav2Vec2-BERT和WavLM的自监督表示，分析其与美式英语母语者的口音评分关联。

Result: 口音强度最佳预测因子是音段自监督表示中的特定特征，这些特征突出了美式英语与非母语英语音段的感知对比。

Conclusion: 自监督语音表示对基于可解释音系特征的口音感知建模具有重要价值。

Abstract: Traditional models of accent perception underestimate the role of gradient
variations in phonological features which listeners rely upon for their accent
judgments. We investigate how pretrained representations from current
self-supervised learning (SSL) models of speech encode phonological
feature-level variations that influence the perception of segmental accent. We
focus on three segments: the labiodental approximant, the rhotic tap, and the
retroflex stop, which are uniformly produced in the English of native speakers
of Hindi as well as other languages in the Indian sub-continent. We use the
CSLU Foreign Accented English corpus (Lander, 2007) to extract, for these
segments, phonological feature probabilities using Phonet (V\'asquez-Correa et
al., 2019) and pretrained representations from Wav2Vec2-BERT (Barrault et al.,
2023) and WavLM (Chen et al., 2022) along with accent judgements by native
speakers of American English. Probing analyses show that accent strength is
best predicted by a subset of the segment's pretrained representation features,
in which perceptually salient phonological features that contrast the expected
American English and realized non-native English segments are given prominent
weighting. A multinomial logistic regression of pretrained representation-based
segment distances from American and Indian English baselines on accent ratings
reveals strong associations between the odds of accent strength and distances
from the baselines, in the expected directions. These results highlight the
value of self-supervised speech representations for modeling accent perception
using interpretable phonological features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农业命名实体识别中高质量中文数据集稀缺的问题，同时弥补以往研究忽视农业与水文、气象关联的不足。

Method: 从大量农业文章中精心整理出AgriCHN数据集，包含4,040个句子和15,799个实体标注，涵盖27类实体。

Result: AgriCHN数据质量高，实体类型丰富且划分细致，实验表明其挑战性及研究潜力。

Conclusion: AgriCHN为农业命名实体识别提供了高质量资源，推动了该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Agricultural named entity recognition is a specialized task focusing on
identifying distinct agricultural entities within vast bodies of text,
including crops, diseases, pests, and fertilizers. It plays a crucial role in
enhancing information extraction from extensive agricultural text resources.
However, the scarcity of high-quality agricultural datasets, particularly in
Chinese, has resulted in suboptimal performance when employing mainstream
methods for this purpose. Most earlier works only focus on annotating
agricultural entities while overlook the profound correlation of agriculture
with hydrology and meteorology. To fill this blank, we present AgriCHN, a
comprehensive open-source Chinese resource designed to promote the accuracy of
automated agricultural entity annotation. The AgriCHN dataset has been
meticulously curated from a wealth of agricultural articles, comprising a total
of 4,040 sentences and encapsulating 15,799 agricultural entity mentions
spanning 27 diverse entity categories. Furthermore, it encompasses entities
from hydrology to meteorology, thereby enriching the diversity of entities
considered. Data validation reveals that, compared with relevant resources,
AgriCHN demonstrates outstanding data quality, attributable to its richer
agricultural entity types and more fine-grained entity divisions. A benchmark
task has also been constructed using several state-of-the-art neural NER
models. Extensive experimental results highlight the significant challenge
posed by AgriCHN and its potential for further research.

Motivation: 形态学缺陷是语言学中一个有趣但研究不足的现象，对提高NLP工具在形态丰富语言中的准确性至关重要。传统资源缺乏对形态缺陷的覆盖，而维基词典等资源虽广泛但可靠性存疑。

Method: 研究定制了一个神经形态分析器，用于标注拉丁语和意大利语语料库，并通过计算验证了维基词典中缺陷动词列表的可靠性。

Result: 结果显示，维基词典对意大利语的形态缺陷描述高度可靠，但对拉丁语有7%的误判，表明众包资源在少研究现象和语言中存在局限性。

Conclusion: 研究为众包数据的质量保证提供了可扩展工具和方法，推动了计算形态学的发展，并扩展了对非英语形态丰富语言缺陷现象的认识。

Abstract: Morphological defectivity is an intriguing and understudied phenomenon in
linguistics. Addressing defectivity, where expected inflectional forms are
absent, is essential for improving the accuracy of NLP tools in morphologically
rich languages. However, traditional linguistic resources often lack coverage
of morphological gaps as such knowledge requires significant human expertise
and effort to document and verify. For scarce linguistic phenomena in
under-explored languages, Wikipedia and Wiktionary often serve as among the few
accessible resources. Despite their extensive reach, their reliability has been
a subject of controversy. This study customizes a novel neural morphological
analyzer to annotate Latin and Italian corpora. Using the massive annotated
data, crowd-sourced lists of defective verbs compiled from Wiktionary are
validated computationally. Our results indicate that while Wiktionary provides
a highly reliable account of Italian morphological gaps, 7% of Latin lemmata
listed as defective show strong corpus evidence of being non-defective. This
discrepancy highlights potential limitations of crowd-sourced wikis as
definitive sources of linguistic knowledge, particularly for less-studied
phenomena and languages, despite their value as resources for rare linguistic
features. By providing scalable tools and methods for quality assurance of
crowd-sourced data, this work advances computational morphology and expands
linguistic knowledge of defectivity in non-English, morphologically rich
languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer模型在稀疏气象轨迹（如台风路径）预测中缺乏上下文知识，TyphoFormer通过引入自然语言描述弥补这一不足。

Method: 利用大型语言模型生成台风数值属性的文本描述，将其作为辅助标记与数值时间序列结合，通过统一Transformer编码器整合信息。

Result: 在HURDAT2基准测试中，TyphoFormer表现优于其他先进方法，尤其在非线性路径变化和历史数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: TyphoFormer通过结合文本和序列信息，显著提升了台风轨迹预测的可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate typhoon track forecasting is crucial for early system warning and
disaster response. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong
performance in modeling the temporal dynamics of dense trajectories of humans
and vehicles in smart cities, they usually lack access to broader contextual
knowledge that enhances the forecasting reliability of sparse meteorological
trajectories, such as typhoon tracks. To address this challenge, we propose
TyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions
as auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time
step, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual
descriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic
hurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological
semantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the
numerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential
information within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model
to leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical
features alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark,
results show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art
baseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear
path shifts and limited historical observations.

Motivation: 探究LLMs的推理能力是否基于真实推理还是仅依赖于答案提示的文本模式。

Method: 提出一个五级答案可见性提示框架，通过间接行为分析系统地操纵答案线索。

Result: 实验显示，当答案线索被掩盖时，LLMs性能下降26.90%，表明其推理可能为事后合理化而非真实推理。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs对答案的依赖现象，并强调需要更细致地理解其推理本质。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning
capabilities, growing evidence suggests much of their success stems from
memorized answer-reasoning patterns rather than genuine inference. In this
work, we investigate a central question: are LLMs primarily anchored to final
answers or to the textual pattern of reasoning chains? We propose a five-level
answer-visibility prompt framework that systematically manipulates answer cues
and probes model behavior through indirect, behavioral analysis. Experiments
across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal a strong and consistent reliance on
explicit answers. The performance drops by 26.90\% when answer cues are masked,
even with complete reasoning chains. These findings suggest that much of the
reasoning exhibited by LLMs may reflect post-hoc rationalization rather than
true inference, calling into question their inferential depth. Our study
uncovers the answer-anchoring phenomenon with rigorous empirical validation and
underscores the need for a more nuanced understanding of what constitutes
reasoning in LLMs.

Operations Research (OR), particularly when dealing with complex problem. In
this work, we propose Step-Opt-Instruct, a framework that augments existing

achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as NL4OPT, MAMO, and
IndustryOR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
Step-Opt, especially in addressing complex OR tasks, with a notable 17.01\%
improvement in micro average accuracy on difficult problems. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured validation with gradual

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable

Result: 在三个多跳QA数据集上表现优异，显著减少token消耗，8B参数模型达到SOTA。

Conclusion: DEC在资源受限环境中高效，适用于复杂QA任务。

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive multi-hop question answering (QA) tasks, which require
integrating evidence from multiple sources to address complex queries, often
necessitate multiple rounds of retrieval and iterative generation by large
language models (LLMs). However, incorporating many documents and extended
contexts poses challenges -such as hallucinations and semantic drift-for
lightweight LLMs with fewer parameters. This work proposes a novel framework
called DEC (Dynamic Enhancement Chain). DEC first decomposes complex questions
into logically coherent subquestions to form a hallucination-free reasoning
chain. It then iteratively refines these subquestions through context-aware
rewriting to generate effective query formulations. For retrieval, we introduce
a lightweight discriminative keyword extraction module that leverages extracted
keywords to achieve targeted, precise document recall with relatively low
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets
demonstrate that DEC performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art
benchmarks while significantly reducing token consumption. Notably, our
approach attains state-of-the-art results on models with 8B parameters,
showcasing its effectiveness in various scenarios, particularly in
resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Stance detection, which aims to identify public opinion towards specific
targets using social media data, is an important yet challenging task. With the
increasing number of online debates among social media users, conversational
stance detection has become a crucial research area. However, existing
conversational stance detection datasets are restricted to a limited set of
specific targets, which constrains the effectiveness of stance detection models
when encountering a large number of unseen targets in real-world applications.
To bridge this gap, we manually curate a large-scale, high-quality zero-shot
conversational stance detection dataset, named ZS-CSD, comprising 280 targets
across two distinct target types. Leveraging the ZS-CSD dataset, we propose
SITPCL, a speaker interaction and target-aware prototypical contrastive
learning model, and establish the benchmark performance in the zero-shot
setting. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SITPCL model
achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot conversational stance
detection. Notably, the SITPCL model attains only an F1-macro score of 43.81%,
highlighting the persistent challenges in zero-shot conversational stance
detection.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) by automating traditional labor-intensive tasks and
consequently accelerated the development of computer-aided applications. As
researchers continue to advance this field with the introduction of novel
language models and more efficient training/finetuning methodologies, the idea
of prompt engineering and subsequent optimization strategies with LLMs has
emerged as a particularly impactful trend to yield a substantial performance
boost across diverse NLP tasks. To best of our knowledge numerous review
articles have explored prompt engineering, however, a critical gap exists in
comprehensive analyses of prompt optimization strategies. To bridge this gap
this paper provides unique and comprehensive insights about the potential of
diverse prompt optimization strategies. It analyzes their underlying working
paradigms and based on these principles, categorizes them into 11 distinct
classes. Moreover, the paper provides details about various NLP tasks where
these prompt optimization strategies have been employed, along with details of
different LLMs and benchmark datasets used for evaluation. This comprehensive
compilation lays a robust foundation for future comparative studies and enables
rigorous assessment of prompt optimization and LLM-based predictive pipelines
under consistent experimental settings: a critical need in the current
landscape. Ultimately, this research will centralize diverse strategic
knowledge to facilitate the adaptation of existing prompt optimization
strategies for development of innovative predictors across unexplored tasks.

Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) tagging remains a foundational component in natural
language processing pipelines, particularly critical for historical text
analysis at the intersection of computational linguistics and digital
humanities. Despite significant advancements in modern large language models
(LLMs) for ancient languages, their application to Medieval Romance languages
presents distinctive challenges stemming from diachronic linguistic evolution,
spelling variations, and labeled data scarcity. This study systematically
investigates the central determinants of POS tagging performance across diverse
corpora of Medieval Occitan, Medieval Spanish, and Medieval French texts,
spanning biblical, hagiographical, medical, and dietary domains. Through
rigorous experimentation, we evaluate how fine-tuning approaches, prompt
engineering, model architectures, decoding strategies, and cross-lingual
transfer learning techniques affect tagging accuracy. Our results reveal both
notable limitations in LLMs' ability to process historical language variations
and non-standardized spelling, as well as promising specialized techniques that

TL;DR: KAG-Thinker是一个基于轻量级大语言模型（LLM）的类人推理框架，通过结构化思维过程提升问答任务中的逻辑一致性和上下文连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在领域知识库问答任务中逻辑和上下文一致性的问题，模拟人类处理复杂问题的认知机制。

Method: 1. 广度分解：将复杂问题拆分为独立子问题（逻辑形式）；2. 知识边界和深度求解模型优化知识检索；3. 使用监督微调而非强化学习对齐结构化推理范式。

Result: 提升了问答任务的逻辑一致性和知识获取的全面性，避免了过度反思。

Conclusion: KAG-Thinker通过结构化思维和优化知识检索，显著提升了LLM在复杂问答任务中的表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce KAG-Thinker, a novel human-like reasoning
framework built upon a parameter-light large language model (LLM). Our approach
enhances the logical coherence and contextual consistency of the thinking
process in question-answering (Q\&A) tasks on domain-specific knowledge bases
(KBs) within LLMs. This framework simulates human cognitive mechanisms for
handling complex problems by establishing a structured thinking process.
Continuing the \textbf{Logical Form} guided retrieval and reasoning technology
route of KAG v0.7, firstly, it decomposes complex questions into independently
solvable sub-problems(also referred to as logical forms) through
\textbf{breadth decomposition}, each represented in two equivalent
forms-natural language and logical function-and further classified as either
Knowledge Retrieval or Reasoning Analysis tasks, with dependencies and
variables passing explicitly modeled via logical function interfaces. In the
solving process, the Retrieval function is used to perform knowledge retrieval
tasks, while the Math and Deduce functions are used to perform reasoning
analysis tasks. Secondly, it is worth noting that, in the Knowledge Retrieval
sub-problem tasks, LLMs and external knowledge sources are regarded as
equivalent KBs. We use the \textbf{knowledge boundary} model to determine the
optimal source using self-regulatory mechanisms such as confidence calibration
and reflective reasoning, and use the \textbf{depth solving} model to enhance
the comprehensiveness of knowledge acquisition. Finally, instead of utilizing
reinforcement learning, we employ supervised fine-tuning with multi-turn
dialogues to align the model with our structured inference paradigm, thereby
avoiding excessive reflection. This is supported by a data evaluation framework
and iterative corpus synthesis, which facilitate the generation of detailed
reasoning trajectories...

*Anwoy Chatterjee,Yash Goel,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HIDE的单次训练免费方法，通过解耦表示检测语言模型的幻觉内容，优于现有单次方法，并在计算效率上优于多方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型生成内容中存在的幻觉问题，提高其可靠性和实用性。

Method: 利用Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC)量化语言模型内部表示的解耦程度，检测幻觉。

Result: 在四个问答数据集上，HIDE在AUC-ROC上平均相对提升29%，计算时间减少51%。

Conclusion: HIDE通过解耦表示实现了高效且实用的幻觉检测，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Contemporary Language Models (LMs), while impressively fluent, often generate
content that is factually incorrect or unfaithful to the input context - a
critical issue commonly referred to as 'hallucination'. This tendency of LMs to
generate hallucinated content undermines their reliability, especially because
these fabrications are often highly convincing and therefore difficult to
detect. While several existing methods attempt to detect hallucinations, most
rely on analyzing multiple generations per input, leading to increased
computational cost and latency. To address this, we propose a single-pass,
training-free approach for effective Hallucination detectIon via Decoupled
rEpresentations (HIDE). Our approach leverages the hypothesis that
hallucinations result from a statistical decoupling between an LM's internal
representations of input context and its generated output. We quantify this
decoupling using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) applied to
hidden-state representations extracted while generating the output sequence. We
conduct extensive experiments on four diverse question answering datasets,
evaluating both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations across six
open-source LMs of varying scales and properties. Our results demonstrate that
HIDE outperforms other single-pass methods in almost all settings, achieving an
average relative improvement of ~29% in AUC-ROC over the best-performing
single-pass strategy across various models and datasets. Additionally, HIDE
shows competitive and often superior performance with multi-pass
state-of-the-art methods, obtaining an average relative improvement of ~3% in
AUC-ROC while consuming ~51% less computation time. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of exploiting internal representation decoupling in LMs for
efficient and practical hallucination detection.

Conclusion: 研究为构建更公平、高效且语言信息丰富的多语言NLP标记器提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Tokenization plays a pivotal role in multilingual NLP. However, existing
tokenizers are often skewed towards high-resource languages, limiting their
effectiveness for linguistically diverse and morphologically rich languages
such as those in the Indian subcontinent. This paper presents a comprehensive
intrinsic evaluation of tokenization strategies across 17 Indian languages. We
quantify the trade-offs between bottom-up and top-down tokenizer algorithms
(BPE and Unigram LM), effects of vocabulary sizes, and compare strategies of
multilingual vocabulary construction such as joint and cluster-based training.
We also show that extremely low-resource languages can benefit from tokenizers
trained on related high-resource languages. Our study provides practical
insights for building more fair, efficient, and linguistically informed
tokenizers for multilingual NLP.

Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用电子健康记录（EHR）中结构化与非结构化数据的因果交互关系，导致预测效果受限。

Method: 提出THCM-CAL框架，构建多模态因果图，通过层次因果发现推断临床实体间的三种交互关系，并采用符合性校准提升多标签ICD编码的可靠性。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上，THCM-CAL表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: THCM-CAL通过建模多模态因果交互和校准预测，显著提升了临床风险预测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Automated clinical risk prediction from electronic health records (EHRs)
demands modeling both structured diagnostic codes and unstructured narrative
notes. However, most prior approaches either handle these modalities separately
or rely on simplistic fusion strategies that ignore the directional,
hierarchical causal interactions by which narrative observations precipitate
diagnoses and propagate risk across admissions. In this paper, we propose
THCM-CAL, a Temporal-Hierarchical Causal Model with Conformal Calibration. Our
framework constructs a multimodal causal graph where nodes represent clinical
entities from two modalities: Textual propositions extracted from notes and ICD
codes mapped to textual descriptions. Through hierarchical causal discovery,
THCM-CAL infers three clinically grounded interactions: intra-slice
same-modality sequencing, intra-slice cross-modality triggers, and inter-slice
risk propagation. To enhance prediction reliability, we extend conformal
prediction to multi-label ICD coding, calibrating per-code confidence intervals
under complex co-occurrences. Experimental results on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
demonstrate the superiority of THCM-CAL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电商广告内容过于模板化且与落地页不匹配，限制了效果。

Method: 提出MarketingFM生成关键词广告，并通过AutoEval系统结合规则和LLM技术自动化评估。

Result: 广告点击率提升9%，印象增加12%，成本降低0.38%；AutoEval与人工评估一致率达89.57%。

Conclusion: 自动化系统显著提升广告效果，但人工监督仍不可或缺。

Abstract: Offsite marketing is essential in e-commerce, enabling businesses to reach
customers through external platforms and drive traffic to retail websites.
However, most current offsite marketing content is overly generic,
template-based, and poorly aligned with landing pages, limiting its
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose MarketingFM, a
retrieval-augmented system that integrates multiple data sources to generate
keyword-specific ad copy with minimal human intervention. We validate
MarketingFM via offline human and automated evaluations and large-scale online
A/B tests. In one experiment, keyword-focused ad copy outperformed templates,
achieving up to 9% higher CTR, 12% more impressions, and 0.38% lower CPC,
demonstrating gains in ad ranking and cost efficiency. Despite these gains,
human review of generated ads remains costly. To address this, we propose
AutoEval-Main, an automated evaluation system that combines rule-based metrics
with LLM-as-a-Judge techniques to ensure alignment with marketing principles.
In experiments with large-scale human annotations, AutoEval-Main achieved
89.57% agreement with human reviewers. Building on this, we propose
AutoEval-Update, a cost-efficient LLM-human collaborative framework to
dynamically refine evaluation prompts and adapt to shifting criteria with
minimal human input. By selectively sampling representative ads for human
review and using a critic LLM to generate alignment reports, AutoEval-Update
improves evaluation consistency while reducing manual effort. Experiments show
the critic LLM suggests meaningful refinements, improving LLM-human agreement.
Nonetheless, human oversight remains essential for setting thresholds and
validating refinements before deployment.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在连续编辑中的幻觉问题和参数偏差对通用能力的负面影响。

Method: 引入结构映射编辑损失和队列机制，动态对齐和冻结参数。

Result: 在连续编辑和单次编辑中表现优异，保持通用NLP任务能力。

Conclusion: QueueEDIT有效提升LLMs的编辑性能，同时保护其通用能力。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive results
but still suffer from hallucinations. Model editing has been proposed to
correct factual inaccuracies in LLMs. A challenging case is sequential model
editing (SME), which aims to rectify errors continuously rather than treating
them as a one-time task. During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be
negatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper,
we propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only
enhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also
mitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs.
Specifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the
triplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of
LLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge
in a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we
select queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to
determine whether previous knowledge needs realignment. Irrelevant parameters
in the queue are frozen, and we update the parameters at the queue head to the
LLM to ensure they do not harm general abilities. Experiments show that our
framework significantly outperforms strong baselines across various SME
settings and maintains competitiveness in single-turn editing. The resulting
LLMs also preserve high capabilities in general NLP tasks throughout the SME
process.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）输出缺乏多样性的原因，提出了一种名为“分支因子”（BF）的度量方法，发现对齐调优显著降低了BF，解释了模型输出稳定性的来源及其对复杂推理的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对齐的大型语言模型（LLM）能力强大，但其输出往往缺乏多样性。本文旨在探究这种稳定性的驱动因素。

Method: 通过引入“分支因子”（BF）这一度量方法，量化模型输出分布的概率集中程度，并分析对齐调优对BF的影响。

Result: 研究发现：1) BF随生成过程逐渐降低；2) 对齐调优显著减少BF，使模型输出更稳定。对齐的思维链（CoT）模型通过延长推理链，进一步降低BF。

Conclusion: BF是理解和控制LLM输出的有力工具，揭示了对齐如何减少多样性、CoT如何促进稳定生成，以及如何引导基础模型减少多样性。

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, aligned large language models (LLMs)
often generate outputs that lack diversity. What drives this stability in the
generation? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability
concentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this
concentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant
measure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our
empirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as
generation progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they
generate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output
distribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude
(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps
explain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.
Building on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications
for complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,
DeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating
longer reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic
(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that
alignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead
steers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., "Sure") that unlock low-entropy
trajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by
nudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can
similarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful
diagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how
alignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how
base models can be steered away from diversity.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在六种先进LLMs上优于现有的单轮和多轮越狱技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在多轮越狱场景中表现出色，为LLMs的安全性研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved exceptional performance across a
wide range of tasks. However, they still pose significant safety risks due to
the potential misuse for malicious purposes. Jailbreaks, which aim to elicit
models to generate harmful content, play a critical role in identifying the
underlying security threats. Recent jailbreaking primarily focuses on
single-turn scenarios, while the more complicated multi-turn scenarios remain
underexplored. Moreover, existing multi-turn jailbreaking techniques struggle
to adapt to the evolving dynamics of dialogue as the interaction progresses. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-turn jailbreaking method that
refines the jailbreaking path globally at each interaction. We also actively
fabricate model responses to suppress safety-related warnings, thereby
increasing the likelihood of eliciting harmful outputs in subsequent questions.
Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method
compared with existing single-turn and multi-turn jailbreaking techniques
across six state-of-the-art LLMs. Our code is publicly available at

Result: 验证结果表明，该模型能有效扩展创新，提升LLMs的泛化和重用能力。

Conclusion: 创新散射模型通过利用阶段间的结构冗余，增强了LLMs对新颖想法的推广能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in reproducing and
extending patterns observed during pretraining but often struggle to generalize
novel ideas beyond their original context. This paper addresses the challenge
of applying such localized innovations - introduced at a specific stage or
component - to other parts of a multi-stage process. We propose a scatter-based
innovation expansion model (innovation scatter model) that guides the LLM
through a four-step process: (1) identifying the core innovation by comparing
the user's input with its surrounding context, (2) generalizing the innovation
by removing references to specific stages or components, (3) determining
whether the generalized innovation applies to a broader scope beyond the
original stage, and (4) systematically applying it to other structurally
similar stages using the LLM. This model leverages structural redundancy across
stages to improve the applicability of novel ideas. Verification results
demonstrate that the innovation scatter model enables LLMs to extend
innovations across structurally similar stages, thereby enhancing
generalization and reuse.

unique challenges for existing QA systems primarily designed for textual

effectively address complex multimodal questions, where several data types are
combined in the query. This is mainly achieved by refining approaches to

Abstract: The ability to dynamically adjust the computational load of neural models
during inference in a resource aware manner is crucial for on-device processing
scenarios, characterised by limited and time-varying computational resources.
Early-exit architectures represent an elegant and effective solution, since
they can process the input with a subset of their layers, exiting at
intermediate branches (the upmost layers are hence removed from the model).
  From a different perspective, for automatic speech recognition applications
there are memory-efficient neural architectures that apply variable frame rate
analysis, through downsampling/upsampling operations in the middle layers,
reducing the overall number of operations and improving significantly the
performance on well established benchmarks. One example is the Zipformer.
However, these architectures lack the modularity necessary to inject early-exit
branches.
  With the aim of improving the performance in early-exit models, we propose
introducing parallel layers in the architecture that process downsampled
versions of their inputs. % in conjunction with standard processing layers. We
show that in this way the speech recognition performance on standard benchmarks
significantly improve, at the cost of a small increase in the overall number of
model parameters but without affecting the inference time.

Method: 将文档分块并聚类向量嵌入，为每个聚类生成摘要，通过马尔可夫链图选择语义顺序构建最终摘要。

Result: 混合方法有效解决了长文档摘要中的信息丢失问题。

Conclusion: 混合方法在保留关键信息的同时提升了摘要的连贯性。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of information from diverse sources has heightened the
need for effective automatic text summarization, which condenses documents into
shorter, coherent texts. Summarization methods generally fall into two
categories: extractive, which selects key segments from the original text, and
abstractive, which generates summaries by rephrasing the content coherently.
Large language models have advanced the field of abstractive summarization, but
they are resourceintensive and face significant challenges in retaining key
information across lengthy documents, which we call being "lost in the middle".
To address these issues, we propose a hybrid summarization approach that
combines extractive and abstractive techniques. Our method splits the document
into smaller text chunks, clusters their vector embeddings, generates a summary
for each cluster that represents a key idea in the document, and constructs the
final summary by relying on a Markov chain graph when selecting the semantic
order of ideas.

Result: 该框架能识别解码策略的显著性能差异，同时考虑了采样设计的非独立同分布假设。

Conclusion: GSD框架为LLM生成文本的评估提供了更全面、统计可靠的方法。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of LLM-generated text remains a fundamental challenge
in natural language processing. Current evaluation approaches often rely on
isolated metrics or simplistic aggregations that fail to capture the nuanced
trade-offs between coherence, diversity, fluency, and other relevant indicators
of text quality. In this work, we adapt a recently proposed framework for
statistical inference based on Generalized Stochastic Dominance (GSD) that
addresses three critical limitations in existing benchmarking methodologies:
the inadequacy of single-metric evaluation, the incompatibility between
cardinal automatic metrics and ordinal human judgments, and the lack of
inferential statistical guarantees. The GSD-front approach enables simultaneous
evaluation across multiple quality dimensions while respecting their different
measurement scales, building upon partial orders of decoding strategies, thus
avoiding arbitrary weighting of the involved metrics. By applying this
framework to evaluate common decoding strategies against human-generated text,
we demonstrate its ability to identify statistically significant performance
differences while accounting for potential deviations from the i.i.d.
assumption of the sampling design.

Abstract: Anaphora resolution plays a critical role in natural language understanding,

comparative evaluation of two modern approaches to anaphora resolution on Czech

fine-tuned variants of the mT5 and Mistral models that we trained specifically
for Czech anaphora resolution. Our experiments demonstrate that while prompting
yields promising few-shot results (up to 74.5% accuracy), the fine-tuned
models, particularly mT5-large, outperform them significantly, achieving up to
88% accuracy while requiring fewer computational resources. We analyze
performance across different anaphora types, antecedent distances, and source

TL;DR: 提出了一种双组件框架（InspireScore和InspireDebate），用于改进基于LLM的辩论系统，通过多维评估和优化方法显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的辩论系统缺乏对客观评估（如真实性和逻辑有效性）的关注，且缺乏结构化优化方法，限制了其效果。

Method: 1. InspireScore：多维评估系统，结合主观和客观指标；2. InspireDebate：通过CoT推理增强、多维DPO和Web-RAG进行优化。

Result: InspireScore与专家判断的相关性提高44%，InspireDebate性能提升57%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了辩论系统的评估和优化能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), debating tasks,
such as argument quality assessment and debate process simulation, have made
significant progress. However, existing LLM-based debating systems focus on
responding to specific arguments while neglecting objective assessments such as
authenticity and logical validity. Furthermore, these systems lack a structured
approach to optimize across various dimensions$-$including evaluation metrics,
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and multi-turn debate refinement$-$thereby
limiting their effectiveness. To address these interconnected challenges, we
propose a dual-component framework: (1) $\textbf{InspireScore}$, a novel
evaluation system that establishes a multi-dimensional assessment architecture
incorporating four subjective criteria (emotional appeal, argument clarity,
argument arrangement, and topic relevance) alongside two objective metrics
(fact authenticity and logical validity); and (2) $\textbf{InspireDebate}$, an
optimized debating framework employing a phased optimization approach through
CoT reasoning enhancement, multi-dimensional Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), and real-time knowledge grounding via web-based Retrieval Augmented
Generation (Web-RAG). Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
$\textbf{InspireScore}$ achieves 44$\%$ higher correlation with expert
judgments compared to existing methods, while $\textbf{InspireDebate}$ shows
significant improvements, outperforming baseline models by 57$\%$. Source code

*Yicheng Fu,Zhemin Huang,Liuxin Yang,Yumeng Lu,Zhongdongming Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chengyu-Bench是一个针对汉语成语的综合基准测试，包含三项任务：情感分类、使用恰当性检测和开放式填空，用于评估语言模型对成语的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汉语成语因其历史和文化背景复杂，语言模型难以准确理解和运用。现有基准测试任务单一，无法全面评估模型能力。

Method: Chengyu-Bench包含2,937个人工验证的示例，覆盖1,765个常见成语，分为情感分类、使用恰当性检测和开放式填空三项任务。

Result: 领先的语言模型在情感分类任务上准确率超过95%，但在使用恰当性和开放式填空任务上分别仅为85%和40%。

Conclusion: Chengyu-Bench显示，语言模型能可靠判断成语情感倾向，但在理解文化背景和上下文方面仍有不足。

Abstract: Chinese idioms (Chengyu) are concise four-character expressions steeped in
history and culture, whose literal translations often fail to capture their
full meaning. This complexity makes them challenging for language models to
interpret and use correctly. Existing benchmarks focus on narrow tasks -
multiple-choice cloze tests, isolated translation, or simple paraphrasing. We
introduce Chengyu-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring three tasks: (1)
Evaluative Connotation, classifying idioms as positive or negative; (2)
Appropriateness, detecting incorrect idiom usage in context; and (3) Open
Cloze, filling blanks in longer passages without options. Chengyu-Bench
comprises 2,937 human-verified examples covering 1,765 common idioms sourced
from diverse corpora. We evaluate leading LLMs and find they achieve over 95%
accuracy on Evaluative Connotation, but only ~85% on Appropriateness and ~40%
top-1 accuracy on Open Cloze. Error analysis reveals that most mistakes arise
from fundamental misunderstandings of idiom meanings. Chengyu-Bench
demonstrates that while LLMs can reliably gauge idiom sentiment, they still
struggle to grasp the cultural and contextual nuances essential for proper
usage. The benchmark and source code are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多跳问答框架（MHQA），用于检测大语言模型（LLMs）在心理健康领域中的偏见，并通过两种去偏技术显著减少了偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康领域的大语言模型可能传播偏见，加剧对边缘群体的伤害，但目前缺乏系统性检测方法。

Method: 使用多跳问答框架（MHQA）分析IMHI数据集，评估四种LLMs的偏见模式，并应用角色扮演模拟和显式偏见减少技术进行去偏。

Result: MHQA方法优于传统方法，识别出偏见放大的关键点，去偏技术实现了66-94%的偏见减少。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在心理健康领域中的偏见问题，为公平AI开发提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in mental healthcare risk propagating biases
that reinforce stigma and harm marginalized groups. While previous research
identified concerning trends, systematic methods for detecting intersectional
biases remain limited. This work introduces a multi-hop question answering
(MHQA) framework to explore LLM response biases in mental health discourse. We
analyze content from the Interpretable Mental Health Instruction (IMHI) dataset
across symptom presentation, coping mechanisms, and treatment approaches. Using
systematic tagging across age, race, gender, and socioeconomic status, we
investigate bias patterns at demographic intersections. We evaluate four LLMs:
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Jamba 1.6, Gemma 3, and Llama 4, revealing systematic
disparities across sentiment, demographics, and mental health conditions. Our
MHQA approach demonstrates superior detection compared to conventional methods,
identifying amplification points where biases magnify through sequential
reasoning. We implement two debiasing techniques: Roleplay Simulation and
Explicit Bias Reduction, achieving 66-94% bias reductions through few-shot
prompting with BBQ dataset examples. These findings highlight critical areas
where LLMs reproduce mental healthcare biases, providing actionable insights
for equitable AI development.

TL;DR: 介绍了Syntactic Acceptability Dataset，包含1,000个英语序列，标注了语法和可接受性状态，是目前最大的公开数据集。初步分析显示语法和可接受性判断在83%的情况下一致，机器学习模型在预测可接受性上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为语法和计算语言学研究设计一个资源，填补公开数据集的空白。

Method: 数据集包含1,000个英语序列，来自教科书和期刊，标注语法状态和可接受性状态，通过众包获取数据。

Result: 语法和可接受性判断在83%的情况下一致，机器学习模型在预测可接受性上表现优于语法预测。

Conclusion: 数据集是当前最大的公开资源，未来将扩展数据集。

Abstract: We present a preview of the Syntactic Acceptability Dataset, a resource being
designed for both syntax and computational linguistics research. In its current
form, the dataset comprises 1,000 English sequences from the syntactic
discourse: Half from textbooks and half from the journal Linguistic Inquiry,
the latter to ensure a representation of the contemporary discourse. Each entry
is labeled with its grammatical status ("well-formedness" according to
syntactic formalisms) extracted from the literature, as well as its
acceptability status ("intuitive goodness" as determined by native speakers)
obtained through crowdsourcing, with highest experimental standards. Even in
its preliminary form, this dataset stands as the largest of its kind that is
publicly accessible. We also offer preliminary analyses addressing three
debates in linguistics and computational linguistics: We observe that
grammaticality and acceptability judgments converge in about 83% of the cases
and that "in-betweenness" occurs frequently. This corroborates existing
research. We also find that while machine learning models struggle with
predicting grammaticality, they perform considerably better in predicting
acceptability. This is a novel finding. Future work will focus on expanding the
dataset.

*Bugra Kilictas,Faruk Alpay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现自回归Transformer语言模型中存在一个关键漏洞，即破折号标记会导致递归语义漂移，引发子句边界幻觉和嵌入空间纠缠。通过符号子句净化和嵌入矩阵重对齐的新方法，无需重新训练模型即可解决问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别并解决自回归Transformer语言模型中由特定标记（如破折号）引发的递归语义漂移问题，以提高生成文本的一致性和安全性。

Method: 结合符号子句净化（phi-infinity算子）和嵌入矩阵重对齐，抑制问题标记的影响，同时保证语义连贯性。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法显著提升了生成文本的一致性和主题保持能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为识别和缓解基础模型中的标记级漏洞提供了通用框架，对AI安全、模型对齐和大型语言模型的稳健部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: We identify a critical vulnerability in autoregressive transformer language
models where the em dash token induces recursive semantic drift, leading to
clause boundary hallucination and embedding space entanglement. Through formal
analysis of token-level perturbations in semantic lattices, we demonstrate that
em dash insertion fundamentally alters the model's latent representations,
causing compounding errors in long-form generation. We propose a novel solution
combining symbolic clause purification via the phi-infinity operator with
targeted embedding matrix realignment. Our approach enables total suppression
of problematic tokens without requiring model retraining, while preserving
semantic coherence through fixed-point convergence guarantees. Experimental
validation shows significant improvements in generation consistency and topic
maintenance. This work establishes a general framework for identifying and
mitigating token-level vulnerabilities in foundation models, with immediate
implications for AI safety, model alignment, and robust deployment of large
language models in production environments. The methodology extends beyond
punctuation to address broader classes of recursive instabilities in neural
text generation systems.

Motivation: 探索LLMs中知识的模块化组织，以及如何高效、有针对性地操控模型。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征共激活分析LLMs，聚焦国家-关系任务，通过消融和放大语义组件观察模型输出变化。

Result: 国家组件主要出现在早期层，而更抽象的关系组件集中在后期层；后期层节点对模型输出的因果影响更强。

Conclusion: LLMs中知识呈现模块化组织，为高效模型操控提供了新方法。

Abstract: We identify semantically coherent, context-consistent network components in
large language models (LLMs) using coactivation of sparse autoencoder (SAE)
features collected from just a handful of prompts. Focusing on country-relation
tasks, we show that ablating semantic components for countries and relations
changes model outputs in predictable ways, while amplifying these components
induces counterfactual responses. Notably, composing relation and country
components yields compound counterfactual outputs. We find that, whereas most
country components emerge from the very first layer, the more abstract relation
components are concentrated in later layers. Furthermore, within relation
components themselves, nodes from later layers tend to have a stronger causal
impact on model outputs. Overall, these findings suggest a modular organization
of knowledge within LLMs and advance methods for efficient, targeted model
manipulation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了针对阿拉伯和穆斯林文化偏见的提示工程策略，发现五种主要方法，其中结构化多步流程效果最佳，但研究数量有限，需进一步探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在对阿拉伯和穆斯林的偏见，但相关提示工程策略研究不足，亟需系统分析以提供指导。

Method: 采用PRISMA指南和Kitchenham系统综述方法，分析了2021-2024年8项实证研究，评估五种提示工程策略。

Result: 五种方法均有效，但效果差异大；结构化多步流程效果最佳（偏见减少87.7%），文化提示更易用。

Conclusion: 提示工程可有效减少偏见，但需更多研究开发适应性技术、专用评估资源及结合其他去偏方法。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet concerns about cultural bias - particularly towards Arabs
and Muslims - pose significant ethical challenges by perpetuating harmful
stereotypes and marginalization. Despite growing recognition of bias in LLMs,
prompt engineering strategies specifically addressing Arab and Muslim
representation remain understudied. This mixed-methods systematic review
examines such techniques, offering evidence-based guidance for researchers and
practitioners. Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review
methodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024
investigating bias mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal five primary
prompt engineering approaches: cultural prompting, affective priming,
self-debiasing techniques, structured multi-step pipelines, and
parameter-optimized continuous prompts. Although all approaches show potential
for reducing bias, effectiveness varied substantially across studies and bias
types. Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to
prompt-based mitigation than others. Structured multi-step pipelines
demonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction
in bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting
offers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness. These results
underscore the accessibility of prompt engineering for mitigating cultural bias
without requiring access to model parameters. The limited number of studies
identified highlights a significant research gap in this critical area. Future
research should focus on developing culturally adaptive prompting techniques,
creating Arab and Muslim-specific evaluation resources, and integrating prompt
engineering with complementary debiasing methods to address deeper stereotypes
while maintaining model utility.

TL;DR: 研究评估了GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro在阿拉伯儿童故事书插图情感识别中的表现，发现GPT-4o优于Gemini，但两者在文化细微情感和模糊叙事背景下表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发文化敏感的教育技术工具，特别是在阿拉伯语环境中，情感识别能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用75张阿拉伯故事书插图，通过零样本、少样本和思维链提示策略评估模型性能，并与人类标注的Plutchik情感框架对比。

Result: GPT-4o在所有条件下表现优于Gemini，最高宏F1得分为59%（思维链提示），而Gemini为43%。模型在文化细微情感和模糊叙事背景下错误率较高。

Conclusion: 当前模型在文化理解上存在局限性，需开发更具文化敏感性的训练方法以支持阿拉伯语学习者的情感识别教育技术。

Abstract: Emotion recognition capabilities in multimodal AI systems are crucial for
developing culturally responsive educational technologies, yet remain
underexplored for Arabic language contexts where culturally appropriate
learning tools are critically needed. This study evaluates the emotion
recognition performance of two advanced multimodal large language models,
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, when processing Arabic children's storybook
illustrations. We assessed both models across three prompting strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought) using 75 images from seven Arabic
storybooks, comparing model predictions with human annotations based on
Plutchik's emotional framework. GPT-4o consistently outperformed Gemini across
all conditions, achieving the highest macro F1-score of 59% with
chain-of-thought prompting compared to Gemini's best performance of 43%. Error
analysis revealed systematic misclassification patterns, with valence
inversions accounting for 60.7% of errors, while both models struggled with
culturally nuanced emotions and ambiguous narrative contexts. These findings
highlight fundamental limitations in current models' cultural understanding and
emphasize the need for culturally sensitive training approaches to develop
effective emotion-aware educational technologies for Arabic-speaking learners.

Result: 用户研究表明，TranslationCorrect显著提高了翻译效率和用户满意度，并支持高质量的错误标注输出。

Conclusion: TranslationCorrect为翻译人员和研究人员提供了一个高效、集成的解决方案，优于传统标注方法。

Abstract: Machine translation (MT) post-editing and research data collection often rely
on inefficient, disconnected workflows. We introduce TranslationCorrect, an
integrated framework designed to streamline these tasks. TranslationCorrect
combines MT generation using models like NLLB, automated error prediction using
models like XCOMET or LLM APIs (providing detailed reasoning), and an intuitive
post-editing interface within a single environment. Built with human-computer
interaction (HCI) principles in mind to minimize cognitive load, as confirmed
by a user study. For translators, it enables them to correct errors and batch
translate efficiently. For researchers, TranslationCorrect exports high-quality
span-based annotations in the Error Span Annotation (ESA) format, using an
error taxonomy inspired by Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM). These
outputs are compatible with state-of-the-art error detection models and
suitable for training MT or post-editing systems. Our user study confirms that
TranslationCorrect significantly improves translation efficiency and user
satisfaction over traditional annotation methods.

Method: 引入L²方法，利用多语言数据的多样性（完整链式注释和逐步混合语言）进行微调，结合解码干预策略。

Result: 实验表明，少量数据即可显著提升推理能力，多语言学习减少数据和推理令牌需求，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: L²方法为数据收集和测试时计算效率提供了有效解决方案，且与其他数据高效方法正交。

Abstract: This paper explores the challenges of test-time scaling of large language
models (LLMs), regarding both the data and inference efficiency. We highlight
the diversity of multi-lingual reasoning based on our pilot studies, and then
introduce a novel approach, \(L^2\) multi-lingual unification learning with a
decoding intervention strategy for further investigation. The basic idea of
\(L^2\) is that the reasoning process varies across different languages, which
may be mutually beneficial to enhance both model performance and efficiency. In
specific, there are two types of multi-lingual data: the entire long
chain-of-thought annotations in different languages and the step-wise mixture
of languages. By further tuning based on them, we show that even small amounts
of data can significantly improve reasoning capabilities. Our findings suggest
that multilingual learning reduces both the required data and the number of
inference tokens while maintaining a comparable performance. Furthermore,
\(L^2\) is orthogonal to other data efficient methods. Thus, we also emphasize
the importance of diverse data selection. The \(L^2\) method offers a promising
solution to the challenges of data collection and test-time compute efficiency
in LLMs.

Result: GPT-Black在识别逻辑连贯和临床有效的因果叙述方面表现最强，GPT-White与专家评估一致，而相似性指标与临床推理质量不符。

Conclusion: 研究强调了指标选择和权重对评估结果的影响，支持在需要可解释性和因果推理的任务中使用基于LLM的评估。

Abstract: This study investigates how accurately different evaluation metrics capture
the quality of causal explanations in automatically generated diagnostic
reports. We compare six metrics: BERTScore, Cosine Similarity, BioSentVec,
GPT-White, GPT-Black, and expert qualitative assessment across two input types:
observation-based and multiple-choice-based report generation. Two weighting
strategies are applied: one reflecting task-specific priorities, and the other
assigning equal weights to all metrics. Our results show that GPT-Black
demonstrates the strongest discriminative power in identifying logically
coherent and clinically valid causal narratives. GPT-White also aligns well
with expert evaluations, while similarity-based metrics diverge from clinical
reasoning quality. These findings emphasize the impact of metric selection and
weighting on evaluation outcomes, supporting the use of LLM-based evaluation
for tasks requiring interpretability and causal reasoning.

Abstract: Lemmatization is crucial for NLP tasks in morphologically rich languages with
ambiguous orthography like Arabic, but existing tools face challenges due to
inconsistent standards and limited genre coverage. This paper introduces two
novel approaches that frame lemmatization as classification into a
Lemma-POS-Gloss (LPG) tagset, leveraging machine translation and semantic
clustering. We also present a new Arabic lemmatization test set covering
diverse genres, standardized alongside existing datasets. We evaluate character
level sequence-to-sequence models, which perform competitively and offer
complementary value, but are limited to lemma prediction (not LPG) and prone to
hallucinating implausible forms. Our results show that classification and
clustering yield more robust, interpretable outputs, setting new benchmarks for
Arabic lemmatization.

Conclusion: TReB基准和评估框架公开可用，为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The majority of data in businesses and industries is stored in tables,
databases, and data warehouses. Reasoning with table-structured data poses
significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to its hidden
semantics, inherent complexity, and structured nature. One of these challenges
is lacking an effective evaluation benchmark fairly reflecting the performances
of LLMs on broad table reasoning abilities. In this paper, we fill in this gap,
presenting a comprehensive table reasoning evolution benchmark, TReB, which
measures both shallow table understanding abilities and deep table reasoning
abilities, a total of 26 sub-tasks. We construct a high quality dataset through
an iterative data processing procedure. We create an evaluation framework to
robustly measure table reasoning capabilities with three distinct inference
modes, TCoT, PoT and ICoT. Further, we benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art LLMs
using this frame work and prove its effectiveness. Experimental results reveal
that existing LLMs still have significant room for improvement in addressing

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合强化学习和上下文学习的方法MeRF，通过将奖励规则直接注入提示中，提升大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法忽视了LLMs的上下文学习能力，而MeRF旨在结合强化学习和上下文学习以提升推理能力。

Method: MeRF方法将奖励规则直接注入提示中，作为上下文动机，激励模型生成更优输出。

Result: 在K&K逻辑谜题基准测试中，MeRF显著优于基线方法，且性能与动机和奖励函数的一致性正相关。

Conclusion: MeRF通过结合强化学习和上下文学习，有效提升了LLMs的推理能力，并能适应误导性动机。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful learn-to-reason paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle
complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RLVR methods overlook one of the
most distinctive capabilities of LLMs, their in-context learning ability, as
prominently demonstrated by the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.
This motivates us to explore how reinforcement learning can be effectively
combined with in-context learning to better improve the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce Motivation-enhanced Reinforcement
Finetuning} (MeRF), an intuitive yet effective method enhancing reinforcement
learning of LLMs by involving ``telling LLMs the rules of the game''.
Specifically, MeRF directly injects the reward specification into the prompt,
which serves as an in-context motivation for model to improve its responses
with awareness of the optimization objective. This simple modification
leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs aligning generation with
optimization, thereby incentivizing the model to generate desired outputs from
both inner motivation and external reward. Empirical evaluations on the Knights
and Knaves~(K&K) logic puzzle reasoning benchmark demonstrate that
\texttt{MeRF} achieves substantial performance gains over baselines. Moreover,
ablation studies show that performance improves with greater consistency
between the in-context motivation and the external reward function, while the
model also demonstrates an ability to adapt to misleading motivations through
reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了ChatGPT和DeepSeek在五个NLP任务中的表现，发现DeepSeek在分类稳定性和逻辑推理上更优，而ChatGPT在需要细腻理解和灵活性的任务中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在NLP任务中的广泛应用，需要全面评估其在不同任务中的表现，以了解其优势和局限性。

Method: 采用结构化实验协议，使用相同的中性提示词，在两个基准数据集上测试两个模型在五个NLP任务中的表现。

Result: DeepSeek在分类稳定性和逻辑推理上表现更好，而ChatGPT在需要细腻理解和灵活性的任务中更优。

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据任务需求选择合适的LLM提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks has sparked significant interest in evaluating their
effectiveness across diverse applications. While models like ChatGPT and
DeepSeek have shown strong results in many NLP domains, a comprehensive
evaluation is needed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and
domain-specific abilities. This is critical as these models are applied to
various tasks, from sentiment analysis to more nuanced tasks like textual
entailment and translation. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT and DeepSeek
across five key NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, topic classification, text
summarization, machine translation, and textual entailment. A structured
experimental protocol is used to ensure fairness and minimize variability. Both
models are tested with identical, neutral prompts and evaluated on two
benchmark datasets per task, covering domains like news, reviews, and
formal/informal texts. The results show that DeepSeek excels in classification
stability and logical reasoning, while ChatGPT performs better in tasks
requiring nuanced understanding and flexibility. These findings provide
valuable insights for selecting the appropriate LLM based on task requirements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了端到端（E2E）框架在口语语法纠错（SGEC）和反馈生成中的应用，比较了级联、部分级联和E2E架构，并提出了一种自动伪标注框架和参考对齐流程以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口语语法纠错（SGEC）因口语不流畅、转录错误和缺乏结构化输入而面临挑战，现有级联系统易受错误传播影响，因此研究E2E框架以解决这些问题。

Method: 比较级联、部分级联和E2E架构，基于Whisper基础模型；提出自动伪标注框架扩充训练数据；引入参考对齐流程和改进的编辑置信度估计。

Result: 在Linguaskill和Speak & Improve语料库上的实验表明，所提方法显著提升了E2E SGEC的性能。

Conclusion: E2E SGEC系统通过伪标注、参考对齐和置信度估计等方法有效提升了性能，为口语语法纠错提供了新思路。

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and feedback play a vital role in
supporting second language (L2) learners, educators, and examiners. While
written GEC is well-established, spoken GEC (SGEC), aiming to provide feedback
based on learners' speech, poses additional challenges due to disfluencies,
transcription errors, and the lack of structured input. SGEC systems typically
follow a cascaded pipeline consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
disfluency detection, and GEC, making them vulnerable to error propagation
across modules. This work examines an End-to-End (E2E) framework for SGEC and
feedback generation, highlighting challenges and possible solutions when
developing these systems. Cascaded, partial-cascaded and E2E architectures are
compared, all built on the Whisper foundation model. A challenge for E2E
systems is the scarcity of GEC labeled spoken data. To address this, an
automatic pseudo-labeling framework is examined, increasing the training data
from 77 to over 2500 hours. To improve the accuracy of the SGEC system,
additional contextual information, exploiting the ASR output, is investigated.
Candidate feedback of their mistakes is an essential step to improving
performance. In E2E systems the SGEC output must be compared with an estimate
of the fluent transcription to obtain the feedback. To improve the precision of
this feedback, a novel reference alignment process is proposed that aims to
remove hypothesised edits that results from fluent transcription errors.
Finally, these approaches are combined with an edit confidence estimation
approach, to exclude low-confidence edits. Experiments on the in-house
Linguaskill (LNG) corpora and the publicly available Speak & Improve (S&I)
corpus show that the proposed approaches significantly boost E2E SGEC
performance.

TL;DR: 研究发现，对预训练Transformer模型进行微调反而会降低MS MARCO段落排序任务的性能，所有微调方法均不如基础模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为何微调预训练模型在MS MARCO任务中表现不佳，挑战传统迁移学习的有效性。

Method: 通过五种模型变体的实验（包括全参数微调和LoRA适配），分析嵌入空间结构和训练动态。

Result: 微调破坏了基础模型预训练学习的最优嵌入空间结构，导致性能下降（MRR@10: 0.3026）。

Conclusion: 结果表明，传统微调方法在饱和基准上可能无效，需通过架构创新实现改进。

Abstract: This paper investigates the counterintuitive phenomenon where fine-tuning
pre-trained transformer models degrades performance on the MS MARCO passage
ranking task. Through comprehensive experiments involving five model
variants-including full parameter fine-tuning and parameter efficient LoRA
adaptations-we demonstrate that all fine-tuning approaches underperform the
base sentence-transformers/all- MiniLM-L6-v2 model (MRR@10: 0.3026). Our
analysis reveals that fine-tuning disrupts the optimal embedding space
structure learned during the base model's extensive pre-training on 1 billion
sentence pairs, including 9.1 million MS MARCO samples. UMAP visualizations
show progressive embedding space flattening, while training dynamics analysis
and computational efficiency metrics further support our findings. These
results challenge conventional wisdom about transfer learning effectiveness on
saturated benchmarks and suggest architectural innovations may be necessary for
meaningful improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨言论检测是NLP应用中的重要任务，但定义模糊，研究旨在明确定义并分析其对模型性能的影响。

Method: 收集并分类仇恨言论定义为14个概念元素，系统评估三种LLM在三种数据集上的零样本性能。

Result: 不同定义对模型性能有影响，但效果因模型架构而异。

Conclusion: 定义的具体性影响模型性能，但需考虑模型架构的差异。

Abstract: Detecting harmful content is a crucial task in the landscape of NLP
applications for Social Good, with hate speech being one of its most dangerous
forms. But what do we mean by hate speech, how can we define it, and how does
prompting different definitions of hate speech affect model performance? The
contribution of this work is twofold. At the theoretical level, we address the
ambiguity surrounding hate speech by collecting and analyzing existing
definitions from the literature. We organize these definitions into a taxonomy
of 14 Conceptual Elements-building blocks that capture different aspects of
hate speech definitions, such as references to the target of hate (individual
or groups) or of the potential consequences of it. At the experimental level,
we employ the collection of definitions in a systematic zero-shot evaluation of
three LLMs, on three hate speech datasets representing different types of data
(synthetic, human-in-the-loop, and real-world). We find that choosing different
definitions, i.e., definitions with a different degree of specificity in terms
of encoded elements, impacts model performance, but this effect is not
consistent across all architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续CoT因潜在思考令牌的序列依赖性导致训练时间长，影响效率。

Method: 提出PCCoT，采用Jacobi迭代并行更新潜在思考令牌。

Result: 实验显示PCCoT在节省50%时间的同时，性能相当或更好，且训练更稳定。

Conclusion: PCCoT显著提升了连续CoT的效率与稳定性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Continuous chain-of-thought has been shown to be effective in saving
reasoning tokens for large language models. By reasoning with continuous latent
thought tokens, continuous CoT is able to perform implicit reasoning in a
compact manner. However, the sequential dependencies between latent thought
tokens spoil parallel training, leading to long training time. In this paper,
we propose Parallel Continuous Chain-of-Thought (PCCoT), which performs Jacobi
iteration on the latent thought tokens, updating them iteratively in parallel
instead of sequentially and thus improving both training and inference
efficiency of continuous CoT. Experiments demonstrate that by choosing the
proper number of iterations, we are able to achieve comparable or even better
performance while saving nearly 50% of the training and inference time.
Moreover, PCCoT shows better stability and robustness in the training process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清数据污染问题对LLM多智能体实验的影响，同时强调仍可研究其涌现动态。

Method: 通过文献综述和案例分析（如社会规范研究），探讨LLM群体中的自组织和涌现动态。

Result: 实证研究表明，LLM群体中确实存在模型依赖的涌现动态，如社会规范的形成。

Conclusion: 尽管数据污染是潜在问题，但LLM群体的涌现动态仍可被有效研究。

Abstract: A potential concern when simulating populations of large language models
(LLMs) is data contamination, i.e. the possibility that training data may shape
outcomes in unintended ways. While this concern is important and may hinder
certain experiments with multi-agent models, it does not preclude the study of
genuinely emergent dynamics in LLM populations. The recent critique by Barrie
and T\"ornberg [1] of the results of Flint Ashery et al. [2] offers an
opportunity to clarify that self-organisation and model-dependent emergent
dynamics can be studied in LLM populations, highlighting how such dynamics have
been empirically observed in the specific case of social conventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义相似度估计在自然语言处理和理解中具有重要应用，如问答、语义搜索等。本文旨在比较不同先进技术的性能。

Method: 使用USE、InferSent和BERT模型，分别在领域特定数据集和公开数据集（Quora问题对）上进行实验。

Result: BERT模型表现优于其他方法，尤其在领域特定数据上，归因于其微调过程。

Conclusion: BERT是处理领域特定数据的最佳选择。

Abstract: Estimation of semantic similarity is an important research problem both in
natural language processing and the natural language understanding, and that
has tremendous application on various downstream tasks such as question
answering, semantic search, information retrieval, document clustering,
word-sense disambiguation and machine translation. In this work, we carry out
the estimation of semantic similarity using different state-of-the-art
techniques including the USE (Universal Sentence Encoder), InferSent and the
most recent BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers,
models. We use two question pairs datasets for the analysis, one is a domain
specific in-house dataset and the other is a public dataset which is the
Quora's question pairs dataset. We observe that the BERT model gave much
superior performance as compared to the other methods. This should be because
of the fine-tuning procedure that is involved in its training process, allowing
it to learn patterns based on the training data that is used. This works
demonstrates the applicability of BERT on domain specific datasets. We infer
from the analysis that BERT is the best technique to use in the case of domain
specific data.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在公共演讲说服力理解上的表现，并开发新的方法论和可解释的文本特征集。

Method: 使用3MT法语数据集，修改演讲文本，通过GPT-4o增强或削弱说服力，分析语言变化。

Result: GPT-4o通过调整情感词汇和句法结构（如疑问句和感叹句）来放大修辞效果，而非模仿人类优化说服力。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在说服力调整上表现出系统性风格修改的特点，而非人类式优化。

Abstract: This study examines how large language models understand the concept of
persuasiveness in public speaking by modifying speech transcripts from PhD
candidates in the "Ma These en 180 Secondes" competition, using the 3MT French
dataset. Our contributions include a novel methodology and an interpretable
textual feature set integrating rhetorical devices and discourse markers. We
prompt GPT-4o to enhance or diminish persuasiveness and analyze linguistic
shifts between original and generated speech in terms of the new features.
Results indicate that GPT-4o applies systematic stylistic modifications rather
than optimizing persuasiveness in a human-like manner. Notably, it manipulates
emotional lexicon and syntactic structures (such as interrogative and
exclamatory clauses) to amplify rhetorical impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否通过分组可预测字节而非直接池化其表示，能够生成有用的固定子词词汇。

Method: 使用外部字节级语言模型在训练中识别连续可预测的字节序列，并将其分组为子词。

Result: ByteSpan生成的词汇效率高，英语形态对齐分数优于BPE，多语言实验中25种语言的压缩和Rényi效率表现相似。

Conclusion: ByteSpan是一种有效的子词分词方法，适用于单语言和多语言场景。

Abstract: Recent dynamic tokenisation methods operate directly on bytes and pool their
latent representations into patches. This bears similarities to computational
models of word segmentation that determine lexical boundaries using spikes in
an autoregressive model's prediction error. Inspired by this connection, we
explore whether grouping predictable bytes - rather than pooling their
representations - can yield a useful fixed subword vocabulary. We propose a new
information-driven subword tokeniser, ByteSpan, that uses an external
byte-level LM during training to identify contiguous predictable byte sequences
and group them into subwords. Experiments show that ByteSpan yields efficient
vocabularies with higher morphological alignment scores than BPE for English.
Multilingual experiments show similar compression and R\'enyi efficiency for 25
languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的计算和能源成本随模型规模和用户数量激增，分词器在模型效率中起关键作用。聊天机器人的用户输入和响应文本与训练语料不同，因此优化分词器可能带来效益。

Method: 使用公开的聊天机器人对话语料库重新设计分词器词汇表，并评估其在对话领域的性能。

Result: 优化后的分词器在聊天对话中显著减少token数量（5%-10%），同时对原始训练语料的token化效率影响极小或略有提升。

Conclusion: 优化分词器针对聊天对话是有效的，能显著降低能源消耗，同时保持或略微提升原始语料的处理效率。

Abstract: The computational and energy costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
increased exponentially driven by the growing model sizes and the massive
adoption of LLMs by hundreds of millions of users. The unit cost of an LLM is
the computation of a token. Therefore, the tokenizer plays an important role in
the efficiency of a model, and they are carefully optimized to minimize the
number of tokens for the text in their training corpus. One of the most popular
applications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users. A key observation
is that, for those chatbots, what is important is the performance of the
tokenizer in the user text input and the chatbot responses. Those are most
likely different from the text in the training corpus. So, a question that
immediately arises is whether there is a potential benefit in optimizing
tokenizers for chatbot conversations. In this paper, this idea is explored for
different tokenizers by using a publicly available corpus of chatbot
conversations to redesign their vocabularies and evaluate their performance in
this domain. The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers
consistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead
to meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or
even slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original
training corpus.

Motivation: 解决现有语音识别系统在训练中未见的词汇（如专有名词、缩写等）识别困难的问题，尤其是拼写与发音不匹配的词汇。

Method: 允许用户在推理过程中动态添加修正，以纠正替换错误，从而提高特定词汇的识别准确率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能将特定词汇的错误率相对降低11%，同时保持整体词汇错误率的竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了拼写-发音不匹配词汇的识别问题，且无需牺牲整体性能。

Abstract: Neural sequence-to-sequence systems deliver state-of-the-art performance for
automatic speech recognition. When using appropriate modeling units, e.g.,
byte-pair encoded characters, these systems are in principal open vocabulary
systems. In practice, however, they often fail to recognize words not seen
during training, e.g., named entities, acronyms, or domain-specific special
words. To address this problem, many context biasing methods have been
proposed; however, for words with a pronunciation-orthography mismatch, these
methods may still struggle. We propose a method which allows corrections of
substitution errors to improve the recognition accuracy of such challenging
words. Users can add corrections on the fly during inference. We show that with
this method we get a relative improvement in biased word error rate of up to
11\%, while maintaining a competitive overall word error rate.

Abstract: Benchmarks like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) have played a
pivotal role in evaluating AI's knowledge and abilities across diverse domains.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on content knowledge, leaving
a critical gap in assessing models' understanding of pedagogy - the method and
practice of teaching. This paper introduces The Pedagogy Benchmark, a novel
dataset designed to evaluate large language models on their Cross-Domain
Pedagogical Knowledge (CDPK) and Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND)
pedagogical knowledge. These benchmarks are built on a carefully curated set of
questions sourced from professional development exams for teachers, which cover
a range of pedagogical subdomains such as teaching strategies and assessment
methods. Here we outline the methodology and development of these benchmarks.
We report results for 97 models, with accuracies spanning a range from 28% to
89% on the pedagogical knowledge questions. We consider the relationship
between cost and accuracy and chart the progression of the Pareto value
frontier over time. We provide online leaderboards at
https://rebrand.ly/pedagogy which are updated with new models and allow
interactive exploration and filtering based on various model properties, such
as cost per token and open-vs-closed weights, as well as looking at performance
in different subjects. LLMs and generative AI have tremendous potential to
influence education and help to address the global learning crisis.
Education-focused benchmarks are crucial to measure models' capacities to
understand pedagogical concepts, respond appropriately to learners' needs, and
support effective teaching practices across diverse contexts. They are needed
for informing the responsible and evidence-based deployment of LLMs and
LLM-based tools in educational settings, and for guiding both development and
policy decisions.

Motivation: 由于用户需求的多样性，自动提示优化可能导致原始意图被误解，产生错误输出，因此需要一种方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了Adaptive Greedy Binary Search (AGBS)方法，模拟常见的提示优化机制，同时保持语义稳定性。

Result: 通过在开源和闭源LLMs上的实验，证明了AGBS在语义一致性和攻击效果之间的平衡能力。

Conclusion: AGBS为设计更可靠的提示优化系统提供了实用见解，相关代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on automatic prompt
engineering in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to refine user inputs and
enhance response accuracy. However, the diversity of user requirements often
leads to unintended misinterpretations, where automated optimizations distort
original intentions and produce erroneous outputs. To address this challenge,
we propose the Adaptive Greedy Binary Search (AGBS) method, which simulates
common prompt optimization mechanisms while preserving semantic stability. Our
approach dynamically evaluates the impact of such strategies on LLM
performance, enabling robust adversarial sample generation. Through extensive
experiments on open and closed-source LLMs, we demonstrate AGBS's effectiveness
in balancing semantic consistency and attack efficacy. Our findings offer
actionable insights for designing more reliable prompt optimization systems.

Conclusion: ASP2LJ框架和RareCases数据集为自动化司法系统研究提供了新工具和方向。

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to predict judicial outcomes, including
relevant legal charge, terms, and fines, which is a crucial process in Large
Language Model(LLM). However, LJP faces two key challenges: (1)Long Tail
Distribution: Current datasets, derived from authentic cases, suffer from high
human annotation costs and imbalanced distributions, leading to model
performance degradation. (2)Lawyer's Improvement: Existing systems focus on
enhancing judges' decision-making but neglect the critical role of lawyers in
refining arguments, which limits overall judicial accuracy. To address these
issues, we propose an Adversarial Self-Play Lawyer Augmented Legal Judgment
Framework, called ASP2LJ, which integrates a case generation module to tackle
long-tailed data distributions and an adversarial self-play mechanism to
enhance lawyers' argumentation skills. Our framework enables a judge to
reference evolved lawyers' arguments, improving the objectivity, fairness, and
rationality of judicial decisions. Besides, We also introduce RareCases, a
dataset for rare legal cases in China, which contains 120 tail-end cases. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the SimuCourt dataset and our
RareCases dataset. Experimental results show our framework brings improvements,
indicating its utilization. Our contributions include an integrated framework,
a rare-case dataset, and publicly releasing datasets and code to support
further research in automated judicial systems.

Motivation: 确保LLM决策透明可信，需解决其内部推理的自相矛盾问题。

Method: 引入不一致性指标，提出基于图和基于能量的两种自动化方法。

Result: 现有模型（包括DeepSeek-R1和GPT-o4-mini）均未完全自洽，方法部分有效。

Conclusion: 自洽性对构建可靠、可解释AI至关重要，但问题复杂需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown increasingly powerful, yet ensuring
their decisions remain transparent and trustworthy requires self-consistency --
no contradictions in their internal reasoning. Our study reveals that even on
simple tasks, such as comparing points on a line or a plane, or reasoning in a
family tree, all smaller models are highly inconsistent, and even
state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-o4-mini are not fully
self-consistent. To quantify and mitigate these inconsistencies, we introduce
inconsistency metrics and propose two automated methods -- a graph-based and an

*Arjun Mukerji,Michael L. Jackson,Jason Jones,Neil Sanghavi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了RWESummary，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在总结真实世界证据（RWE）研究时的表现，并发现Gemini 2.5模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前LLMs在医学研究辅助任务中表现良好，但尚未专门评估其在总结RWE研究时的能力。

Method: 通过RWESummary（MedHELM框架的扩展）对LLMs进行基准测试，包括一个场景和三种评估，涵盖医学研究总结中的主要错误类型。

Result: 在13项RWE研究中，Gemini 2.5模型（Flash和Pro）表现最佳。

Conclusion: RWESummary是一个新颖且有用的基准模型，适用于RWE研究总结任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for general
summarization tasks as well as medical research assistance, but they have not
been specifically evaluated for the task of summarizing real-world evidence
(RWE) from structured output of RWE studies. We introduce RWESummary, a
proposed addition to the MedHELM framework (Bedi, Cui, Fuentes, Unell et al.,
2025) to enable benchmarking of LLMs for this task. RWESummary includes one
scenario and three evaluations covering major types of errors observed in
summarization of medical research studies and was developed using Atropos
Health proprietary data. Additionally, we use RWESummary to compare the
performance of different LLMs in our internal RWE summarization tool. At the
time of publication, with 13 distinct RWE studies, we found the Gemini 2.5
models performed best overall (both Flash and Pro). We suggest RWESummary as a
novel and useful foundation model benchmark for real-world evidence study
summarization.

TL;DR: MLLP-VRAIN团队在IWSLT 2025实时语音翻译任务中提出了一种模块化级联系统，结合Whisper和NLLB模型，通过轻量级适应技术实现高质量低延迟的翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长语音实时翻译的挑战，避免从头训练端到端模型。

Method: 结合Whisper ASR和NLLB MT模型，采用前缀训练和自适应发射策略（如wait-$k$和RALCP）。

Result: 在ACL60/60数据集上BLEU得分31.96，延迟2.94秒；IWSLT25Instruct测试集得分29.8 BLEU。

Conclusion: 预训练模型轻量适应可有效实现长语音实时翻译，无需大量领域数据或端到端训练。

Abstract: This work describes the participation of the MLLP-VRAIN research group in the
shared task of the IWSLT 2025 Simultaneous Speech Translation track. Our
submission addresses the unique challenges of real-time translation of
long-form speech by developing a modular cascade system that adapts strong
pre-trained models to streaming scenarios. We combine Whisper Large-V3-Turbo
for ASR with the multilingual NLLB-3.3B model for MT, implementing lightweight
adaptation techniques rather than training new end-to-end models from scratch.
Our approach employs document-level adaptation with prefix training to enhance
the MT model's ability to handle incomplete inputs, while incorporating
adaptive emission policies including a wait-$k$ strategy and RALCP for managing
the translation stream. Specialized buffer management techniques and
segmentation strategies ensure coherent translations across long audio
sequences. Experimental results on the ACL60/60 dataset demonstrate that our
system achieves a favorable balance between translation quality and latency,
with a BLEU score of 31.96 and non-computational-aware StreamLAAL latency of
2.94 seconds. Our final model achieves a preliminary score on the official test
set (IWSLT25Instruct) of 29.8 BLEU. Our work demonstrates that carefully
adapted pre-trained components can create effective simultaneous translation
systems for long-form content without requiring extensive in-domain parallel
data or specialized end-to-end training.

TL;DR: STUPID方法通过PID控制器动态调整推理中的激活引导强度，减少冗余推理步骤，提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在扩展链式推理中因过度思考导致的冗余计算和性能下降问题。

Method: 结合块级分类器和PID控制机制，动态调整引导强度。

Result: 在GSM8K上准确率提升6%，令牌使用减少32%。

Conclusion: STUPID提供了一种动态校准推理的框架，兼顾推理质量和计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models employing extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
often suffer from the overthinking phenomenon, generating excessive and
redundant reasoning steps that increase computational costs while potentially
degrading performance. While recent work has explored static steering
approaches to mitigate this issue, they lack the adaptability to dynamically
adjust intervention strength based on real-time reasoning quality. We propose
STUPID (Steering Token Usage via PID controller), a novel training-free method
that employs a PID controller to dynamically modulate activation steering
strength during inference. Our approach combines a chunk-level classifier for
detecting redundant reasoning patterns with a PID control mechanism that
adaptively adjusts steering intensity based on the predicted redundancy
probability. Experimental evaluation on GSM8K demonstrates that STUPID achieves
a 6% improvement in accuracy while reducing token usage by 32%, outperforming
static steering baselines. Our method provides a principled framework for
dynamic reasoning calibration that maintains reasoning quality while
significantly improving computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于激励的方法，利用强化学习（RL）从零开始训练LLMs，无需依赖标注或合成数据，实现了超长高质量文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在超长文本生成中的长度限制和质量下降问题，避免传统方法对合成数据的依赖及其缺陷。

Method: 从基础模型出发，通过RL训练，结合专用奖励模型，引导模型在写作过程中进行规划和优化。

Result: LongWriter-Zero模型在长文本写作任务中表现优于传统SFT方法，并在多个评测中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 激励方法有效提升了LLMs的超长文本生成能力，且无需依赖合成数据，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Ultra-long generation by large language models (LLMs) is a widely demanded
scenario, yet it remains a significant challenge due to their maximum
generation length limit and overall quality degradation as sequence length
increases. Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on
''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic
long-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT
data, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and
consistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In
this work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely
from scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages
reinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality
text generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a
base model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that
facilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support
this, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved
length control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental
evaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B,
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks,
achieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and
Arena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and
Qwen3-235B. We open-source our data and model checkpoints under

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to explain how neural networks work by
uncovering their underlying causal mechanisms. As the field grows in influence,
it is increasingly important to examine not just models themselves, but the
assumptions, concepts and explanatory strategies implicit in MI research. We
argue that mechanistic interpretability needs philosophy: not as an
afterthought, but as an ongoing partner in clarifying its concepts, refining
its methods, and assessing the epistemic and ethical stakes of interpreting AI
systems. Taking three open problems from the MI literature as examples, this
position paper illustrates the value philosophy can add to MI research, and
outlines a path toward deeper interdisciplinary dialogue.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Commutative Vector Quantization (CommVQ)的方法，通过量化和轻量级编码显著减少LLM推理中的KV缓存内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在长上下文应用中KV缓存成为GPU内存瓶颈的问题。

Method: 使用加法量化和轻量级编码器压缩KV缓存，设计可与RoPE交换的码本，并通过EM算法训练。

Result: 在2位量化下减少87.5%的FP16 KV缓存大小，支持1位量化且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: CommVQ高效减少了内存占用，支持长上下文推理，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring
long context lengths, but the key-value (KV) cache often becomes a memory
bottleneck on GPUs as context grows. To address this, we propose Commutative
Vector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for
long-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a
lightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded
via simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during
decoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position
Embedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
This enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention
mechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and
low overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context
benchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%
with 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache
quantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with
minimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context
length on a single RTX 4090 GPU. The source code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在数学问题上的局限性，尤其是面对需要新颖思维方式的问题时的表现。

Method: 引入OMEGA基准，通过程序生成训练-测试对，评估模型在探索性、组合性和转换性泛化上的表现。

Result: 前沿LLMs在问题复杂度增加时表现显著下降，Qwen系列模型在探索性泛化上有提升，但组合和转换泛化改进有限。

Conclusion: OMEGA为提升LLMs的数学创造力提供了基础，揭示了当前模型在复杂泛化能力上的不足。

Abstract: Recent large-scale language models (LLMs) with long Chain-of-Thought
reasoning-such as DeepSeek-R1-have achieved impressive results on
Olympiad-level mathematics benchmarks. However, they often rely on a narrow set
of strategies and struggle with problems that require a novel way of thinking.
To systematically investigate these limitations, we introduce
OMEGA-Out-of-distribution Math Problems Evaluation with 3 Generalization Axes-a
controlled yet diverse benchmark designed to evaluate three axes of
out-of-distribution generalization, inspired by Boden's typology of creativity:
(1) Exploratory-applying known problem solving skills to more complex instances
within the same problem domain; (2) Compositional-combining distinct reasoning
skills, previously learned in isolation, to solve novel problems that require
integrating these skills in new and coherent ways; and (3)
Transformative-adopting novel, often unconventional strategies by moving beyond
familiar approaches to solve problems more effectively. OMEGA consists of
programmatically generated training-test pairs derived from templated problem
generators across geometry, number theory, algebra, combinatorics, logic, and
puzzles, with solutions verified using symbolic, numerical, or graphical
methods. We evaluate frontier (or top-tier) LLMs and observe sharp performance
degradation as problem complexity increases. Moreover, we fine-tune the
Qwen-series models across all generalization settings and observe notable
improvements in exploratory generalization, while compositional generalization
remains limited and transformative reasoning shows little to no improvement. By
isolating and quantifying these fine-grained failures, OMEGA lays the
groundwork for advancing LLMs toward genuine mathematical creativity beyond
mechanical proficiency.

Motivation: 现有PRM主要基于模型最终输出训练，难以稳健评估中间推理轨迹，尤其是在前沿推理模型生成的轨迹-响应输出中。

Method: 引入ReasonFlux-PRM，结合步骤级和轨迹级监督，支持离线和在线奖励监督，包括数据选择、强化学习和测试时扩展。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ReasonFlux-PRM-7B表现优于其他PRM和人工基线，平均提升12.1%（监督微调）、4.5%（强化学习）和6.3%（测试时扩展）。

Conclusion: ReasonFlux-PRM在评估推理轨迹和提升模型性能方面表现出色，并提供了高效版本以适应资源受限场景。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for supervising intermediate reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs).
Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and
struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in
the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier
reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a
novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the
trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both
step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward
assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt
ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online
settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for
downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense
process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning,
and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results
on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond
demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs
(e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our
derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement
learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient
ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment.

Motivation: 研究扩散模型在图像生成中的计算机制，以揭示其处理合成与自然数据分布时的算法差异。

Method: 通过系统干预实验，分析了2,000张合成图像和2,000张CelebA面部图像，测量计算复杂性和注意力模式。

Result: 发现真实面部处理需要更高计算复杂度（1.084±0.008），并识别了八种功能不同的注意力机制。干预实验显示性能下降25.6%至128.3%。

Conclusion: 研究为生成模型行为的算法理解和控制提供了定量基础，支持通过机制干预策略优化模型性能。

Abstract: We present a quantitative circuit-level analysis of diffusion models,
establishing computational pathways and mechanistic principles underlying image
generation processes. Through systematic intervention experiments across 2,000
synthetic and 2,000 CelebA facial images, we discover fundamental algorithmic
differences in how diffusion architectures process synthetic versus
naturalistic data distributions. Our investigation reveals that real-world face
processing requires circuits with measurably higher computational complexity
(complexity ratio = 1.084 plus/minus 0.008, p < 0.001), exhibiting distinct
attention specialization patterns with entropy divergence ranging from 0.015 to
0.166 across denoising timesteps. We identify eight functionally distinct
attention mechanisms showing specialized computational roles: edge detection
(entropy = 3.18 plus/minus 0.12), texture analysis (entropy = 4.16 plus/minus
0.08), and semantic understanding (entropy = 2.67 plus/minus 0.15).
Intervention analysis demonstrates critical computational bottlenecks where
targeted ablations produce 25.6% to 128.3% performance degradation, providing
causal evidence for identified circuit functions. These findings establish
quantitative foundations for algorithmic understanding and control of
generative model behavior through mechanistic intervention strategies.

Conclusion: SRKD在现实部署场景中表现出高效性和有效性。

Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation faces practical challenges due to the
computational complexity and deployment limitations of large-scale
transformer-based models. To address this, we propose a novel Structure- and
Relation-aware Knowledge Distillation framework, named SRKD, that transfers
rich geometric and semantic knowledge from a large frozen teacher model (>100M)
to a lightweight student model (<15M). Specifically, we propose an affinity
matrix-based relation alignment module, which distills structural dependencies
from the teacher to the student through point-wise similarity matching,
enhancing the student's capability to learn contextual interactions. Meanwhile,
we introduce a cross-sample mini-batch construction strategy that enables the
student to perceive stable and generalized geometric structure. This aligns
across diverse point cloud instances of the teacher, rather than within a
single sample. Additionally, KL divergence is applied to align semantic
distributions, and ground-truth supervision further reinforces accurate
segmentation. Our method achieves state of the art performance with
significantly reduced model complexity, demonstrating its effectiveness and
efficiency in real-world deployment scenarios. Our Code is available at

Motivation: 阿拉斯加细粒度土壤地图绘制对生态和基础设施至关重要，但传统方法依赖实地工作且覆盖不足。随着气候变化加剧永久冻土融化，高分辨率地图成为迫切需求。

Method: MISO结合了地理空间基础模型（视觉特征提取）、隐式神经表示（连续空间预测）和对比学习（多模态对齐和地理定位感知），并与RF进行了对比。

Result: MISO在空间交叉验证和区域分析中表现优于RF，泛化能力更强，召回率更高，适用于永久冻土监测和环境过程研究。

Conclusion: MISO展示了先进机器学习在细粒度土壤地图绘制中的潜力，为永久冻土区域的土壤采样和基础设施规划提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Fine-scale soil mapping in Alaska, traditionally relying on fieldwork and
localized simulations, remains a critical yet underdeveloped task, despite the
region's ecological importance and extensive permafrost coverage. As permafrost
thaw accelerates due to climate change, it threatens infrastructure stability
and key ecosystem services, such as soil carbon storage. High-resolution soil
maps are essential for characterizing permafrost distribution, identifying
vulnerable areas, and informing adaptation strategies. We present MISO, a
vision-based machine learning (ML) model to produce statewide fine-scale soil
maps for near-surface permafrost and soil taxonomy. The model integrates a
geospatial foundation model for visual feature extraction, implicit neural
representations for continuous spatial prediction, and contrastive learning for
multimodal alignment and geo-location awareness. We compare MISO with Random
Forest (RF), a traditional ML model that has been widely used in soil mapping
applications. Spatial cross-validation and regional analysis across Permafrost
Zones and Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) show that MISO generalizes better
to remote, unseen locations and achieves higher recall than RF, which is
critical for monitoring permafrost thaw and related environmental processes.
These findings demonstrate the potential of advanced ML approaches for
fine-scale soil mapping and provide practical guidance for future soil sampling
and infrastructure planning in permafrost-affected landscapes. The project will
be released at https://github.com/knowledge-computing/Peatland-permafrost.

Conclusion: 框架模块化设计、可解释性和高效部署特性，适用于动态零工经济平台的大规模流失建模。

Abstract: Predicting user churn in non-subscription gig platforms, where disengagement
is implicit, poses unique challenges due to the absence of explicit labels and
the dynamic nature of user behavior. Existing methods often rely on aggregated
snapshots or static visual representations, which obscure temporal cues
critical for early detection. In this work, we propose a temporally-aware
computer vision framework that models user behavioral patterns as a sequence of
radar chart images, each encoding day-level behavioral features. By integrating
a pretrained CNN encoder with a bidirectional LSTM, our architecture captures
both spatial and temporal patterns underlying churn behavior. Extensive
experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms classical models and ViT-based radar chart baselines, yielding
gains of 17.7 in F1 score, 29.4 in precision, and 16.1 in AUC, along with
improved interpretability. The framework's modular design, explainability
tools, and efficient deployment characteristics make it suitable for
large-scale churn modeling in dynamic gig-economy platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球老龄化加剧，浴室成为老年人跌倒的高发环境，现有单模态系统在复杂环境中准确性不足，亟需一种隐私保护的多模态解决方案。

Method: 开发了传感器评估框架，融合毫米波雷达和3D振动传感，构建大规模隐私保护数据集；提出P2MFDS双流网络，结合CNN-BiLSTM-Attention和多尺度CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention分支。

Result: P2MFDS在准确率和召回率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该系统为老年人浴室跌倒检测提供了高效、隐私保护的解决方案，代码和预训练模型将开源。

Abstract: By 2050, people aged 65 and over are projected to make up 16 percent of the
global population. As aging is closely associated with increased fall risk,
particularly in wet and confined environments such as bathrooms where over 80
percent of falls occur. Although recent research has increasingly focused on
non-intrusive, privacy-preserving approaches that do not rely on wearable
devices or video-based monitoring, these efforts have not fully overcome the
limitations of existing unimodal systems (e.g., WiFi-, infrared-, or
mmWave-based), which are prone to reduced accuracy in complex environments.
These limitations stem from fundamental constraints in unimodal sensing,
including system bias and environmental interference, such as multipath fading
in WiFi-based systems and drastic temperature changes in infrared-based
methods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving
Multimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments.
First, we develop a sensor evaluation framework to select and fuse
millimeter-wave radar with 3D vibration sensing, and use it to construct and
preprocess a large-scale, privacy-preserving multimodal dataset in real
bathroom settings, which will be released upon publication. Second, we
introduce P2MFDS, a dual-stream network combining a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention branch
for radar motion dynamics with a multi-scale CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention branch
for vibration impact detection. By uniting macro- and micro-scale features,
P2MFDS delivers significant gains in accuracy and recall over state-of-the-art
approaches. Code and pretrained models will be made available at:

Motivation: 当前AV领域的研究和实践过于关注模型/算法，而低估了数据质量（DQ）的重要性。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过一个多层框架解决多源和多模态数据质量的问题。

Method: 提出一个五层框架（数据层、DQ层、任务层、应用层和目标层），并通过nuScenes数据集的案例研究验证了部分去除多源图像数据冗余可以提升YOLOv8目标检测任务的性能。

Result: 案例研究表明，部分去除多源图像数据的冗余可以提高目标检测任务的性能，同时揭示了图像和LiDAR多模态数据中存在的冗余问题。

Conclusion: 本文为AV领域提出了一个关键但未被充分探索的方向，即结合数据质量、任务编排和性能导向的系统开发，以构建更具适应性、可解释性和鲁棒性的AV系统。

Abstract: The next-generation autonomous vehicles (AVs), embedded with frequent
real-time decision-making, will rely heavily on a large volume of multisource
and multimodal data. In real-world settings, the data quality (DQ) of different
sources and modalities usually varies due to unexpected environmental factors
or sensor issues. However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field
overwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To
fulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality,
efficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and
data quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ
layer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework
aims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a
case study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that
partially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8
object detection task performance. Analysis on multimodal data of image and
LiDAR further presents existing redundancy DQ issues. This paper opens up a
range of critical but unexplored challenges at the intersection of DQ, task
orchestration, and performance-oriented system development in AVs. It is
expected to guide the AV community toward building more adaptive, explainable,
and resilient AVs that respond intelligently to dynamic environments and
heterogeneous data streams. Code, data, and implementation details are publicly

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分组的高效反馈门网络，用于单幅高光谱图像超分辨率，通过反馈和门操作提升空间-光谱信息利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单幅高光谱图像超分辨率方法未能充分探索波段间和空间-光谱信息的相干性，导致性能受限。

Method: 设计了高效反馈门网络，包括SPDFM模块（通道混洗和扩张卷积）、SSRGM模块（宽边界感知门和光谱增强门），以及三维SSRGM增强整体信息。

Result: 在三个高光谱数据集上实验表明，该方法在光谱保真度和空间内容重建上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 所提方法通过分组和门操作有效提升了高光谱图像超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Even without auxiliary images, single hyperspectral image super-resolution
(SHSR) methods can be designed to improve the spatial resolution of
hyperspectral images. However, failing to explore coherence thoroughly along
bands and spatial-spectral information leads to the limited performance of the
SHSR. In this study, we propose a novel group-based SHSR method termed the
efficient feedback gate network, which uses various feedbacks and gate
operations involving large kernel convolutions and spectral interactions. In
particular, by providing different guidance for neighboring groups, we can
learn rich band information and hierarchical hyperspectral spatial information
using channel shuffling and dilatation convolution in shuffled and progressive
dilated fusion module(SPDFM). Moreover, we develop a wide-bound perception gate
block and a spectrum enhancement gate block to construct the spatial-spectral
reinforcement gate module (SSRGM) and obtain highly representative
spatial-spectral features efficiently. Additionally, we apply a
three-dimensional SSRGM to enhance holistic information and coherence for
hyperspectral data. The experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed network over the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of spectral fidelity and spatial content
reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合旋转感知目标检测模型和视觉语言解析器的混合框架，用于高效提取2D工程图纸中的关键信息，并在下游制造任务中展示实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提取2D工程图纸信息效率低且不可靠，通用OCR模型因复杂布局和工程符号表现不佳，需更高效准确的解决方案。

Method: 采用YOLOv11-OBB定位注释并提取定向边界框（OBB）补丁，再通过微调的轻量级视觉语言模型（VLM）解析为结构化输出。

Result: Donut模型表现优于Florence-2，精确度88.5%，召回率99.2%，F1分数93.5%，幻觉率11.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升2D图纸信息提取的效率和准确性，支持下游制造任务，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering
drawings is essential for advancing digital manufacturing workflows. Such
information includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), measures,
material specifications, and textual annotations. Manual extraction is slow and
labor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts,
engineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable
outputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To
address these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that
integrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a
transformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies
YOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)
patches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,
lightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D
mechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is
trained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These
are parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are
lightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited
computational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated
dataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a
comparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four
key metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2%
recall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%. Finally, a
case study demonstrates how the extracted structured information supports
downstream manufacturing tasks such as process and tool selection, showcasing
the practical utility of the proposed framework in modernizing 2D drawing
interpretation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为STPT的自监督学习方法，用于自动化预测体外受精胚胎的存活率，解决了现有方法在处理胚胎发育视频时的内存和语义对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于标记的妊娠结果数据有限，且传统自监督学习方法在处理胚胎时间推移视频时面临内存需求和语义对齐的挑战，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: STPT方法分为空间和时间两个阶段，每个阶段只训练一个编码器以减少内存需求，并通过避免跨视频的帧对齐来处理时间不一致性。

Result: 在23,027个时间推移视频（3,286个标记）上，STPT达到了最高的AUC（0.635），优于基线方法。

Conclusion: STPT方法能够高效处理长视频和时间变异性，为胚胎存活率预测提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automating embryo viability prediction for in vitro fertilization (IVF) is
important but challenging due to the limited availability of labeled pregnancy
outcome data, as only a small fraction of embryos are labeled after transfer.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to
improve prediction. However, existing SSL methods for videos are not directly
applicable to embryo development videos due to two challenges: (1) embryo
time-lapse videos contain hundreds of frames, requiring significant GPU memory
for conventional SSL; (2) the dataset contains videos with varying lengths and
many outlier frames, causing traditional video alignment methods to struggle
with semantic misalignment. We propose Spatial-Temporal Pre-Training (STPT) to
address these challenges. STPT includes two stages: spatial and temporal. In
each stage, only one encoder is trained while the other is frozen, reducing
memory demands. To handle temporal misalignment, STPT avoids frame-by-frame
alignment across videos. The spatial stage learns from alignments within each
video and its temporally consistent augmentations. The temporal stage then
models relationships between video embeddings. Our method efficiently handles
long videos and temporal variability. On 23,027 time-lapse videos (3,286
labeled), STPT achieves the highest AUC of 0.635 (95% CI: 0.632-0.638) compared
to baselines, with limited computational resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球主要死因之一，现有筛查方法多依赖近期数据，未能充分利用时间序列信息。本文旨在通过捕捉乳腺组织的动态变化，提升风险预测的准确性和个性化。

Method: 采用Vision Mamba RNN（VMRNN）结合状态空间模型（SSM）和LSTM机制，捕捉时间序列的细微变化；引入不对称模块（SAD和LAT）识别临床相关的双侧差异。

Result: 在癌症发病预测中表现显著提升，尤其对高密度乳腺病例和长期时间点（第四和第五年）效果更佳。

Conclusion: 该框架为乳腺癌早期识别和个性化筛查提供了新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide and is typically
detected via screening programs where healthy people are invited in regular
intervals. Automated risk prediction approaches have the potential to improve
this process by facilitating dynamically screening of high-risk groups. While
most models focus solely on the most recent screening, there is growing
interest in exploiting temporal information to capture evolving trends in
breast tissue, as inspired by clinical practice. Early methods typically relied
on two time steps, and although recent efforts have extended this to multiple
time steps using Transformer architectures, challenges remain in fully
harnessing the rich temporal dynamics inherent in longitudinal imaging data. In
this work, we propose to instead leverage Vision Mamba RNN (VMRNN) with a
state-space model (SSM) and LSTM-like memory mechanisms to effectively capture
nuanced trends in breast tissue evolution. To further enhance our approach, we
incorporate an asymmetry module that utilizes a Spatial Asymmetry Detector
(SAD) and Longitudinal Asymmetry Tracker (LAT) to identify clinically relevant
bilateral differences. This integrated framework demonstrates notable
improvements in predicting cancer onset, especially for the more challenging
high-density breast cases and achieves superior performance at extended time
points (years four and five), highlighting its potential to advance early
breast cancer recognition and enable more personalized screening strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出Trans-CBCT和Trans²-CBCT两种方法，通过结合CNN-Transformer和点几何推理，显著提升了稀疏视图CBCT重建的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏视图CBCT重建中的强伪影和空间覆盖不足问题。

Method: 1. 使用TransUNet替代传统编码器，结合CNN和Transformer；2. 引入邻居感知的Point Transformer增强体积一致性。

Result: 在LUNA16数据集上，Trans-CBCT比基线提升1.17 dB PSNR和0.0163 SSIM；Trans²-CBCT进一步提升了0.63 dB PSNR和0.0117 SSIM。

Conclusion: 结合CNN-Transformer特征和点几何推理，有效提升了稀疏视图CBCT重建性能。

Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) using only a few X-ray projection views
enables faster scans with lower radiation dose, but the resulting severe
under-sampling causes strong artifacts and poor spatial coverage. We address
these challenges in a unified framework. First, we replace conventional
UNet/ResNet encoders with TransUNet, a hybrid CNN-Transformer model.
Convolutional layers capture local details, while self-attention layers enhance
global context. We adapt TransUNet to CBCT by combining multi-scale features,
querying view-specific features per 3D point, and adding a lightweight
attenuation-prediction head. This yields Trans-CBCT, which surpasses prior
baselines by 1.17 dB PSNR and 0.0163 SSIM on the LUNA16 dataset with six views.
Second, we introduce a neighbor-aware Point Transformer to enforce volumetric
coherence. This module uses 3D positional encoding and attention over k-nearest
neighbors to improve spatial consistency. The resulting model, Trans$^2$-CBCT,
provides an additional gain of 0.63 dB PSNR and 0.0117 SSIM. Experiments on
LUNA16 and ToothFairy show consistent gains from six to ten views, validating
the effectiveness of combining CNN-Transformer features with point-based
geometry reasoning for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid growth of the Internet of Things technologies and
the widespread adoption of 5G wireless networks have led to an exponential
increase in the number of radiation devices operating in complex
electromagnetic environments. A key challenge in managing and securing these
devices is accurate identification and classification. To address this
challenge, specific emitter identification techniques have emerged as a
promising solution that aims to provide reliable and efficient means of
identifying individual radiation devices in a unified and standardized manner.
This research proposes an approach that leverages transient energy spectrum
analysis using the General Linear Chirplet Transform to extract features from
RF devices. A dataset comprising nine RF devices is utilized, with each sample
containing 900 attributes and a total of 1080 equally distributed samples
across the devices. These features are then used in a classification modeling
framework. To overcome the limitations of conventional machine learning
methods, we introduce a hybrid deep learning model called the CNN-Bi-GRU for
learning the identification of RF devices based on their transient
characteristics. The proposed approach provided a 10-fold cross-validation
performance with a precision of 99.33%, recall of 99.53%, F1-score of 99.43%,
and classification accuracy of 99.17%. The results demonstrate the promising
classification performance of the CNN-Bi-GRU approach, indicating its
suitability for accurately identifying RF devices based on their transient
characteristics and its potential for enhancing device identification and
classification in complex wireless environments.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is essential for the safety and reliability of autonomous

paper, we introduce real-time anomaly detection for autonomous driving,
prioritizing both minimal response time and high accuracy. We propose a novel
multimodal asynchronous hybrid network that combines event streams from event
cameras with image data from RGB cameras. Our network utilizes the high
temporal resolution of event cameras through an asynchronous Graph Neural
Network and integrates it with spatial features extracted by a CNN from RGB
images. This combination effectively captures both the temporal dynamics and
spatial details of the driving environment, enabling swift and precise anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach
outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and response time, achieving
millisecond-level real-time performance.

Result: 实验表明，现有方法在现实条件下性能下降，而提出的方法在多种模态和任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该研究为医学图像分析中的VLMs适应提供了更实用的解决方案，尤其在数据不平衡和无验证集的场景下。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are gaining attention in medical image
analysis. These are pre-trained on large, heterogeneous data sources, yielding
rich and transferable representations. Notably, the combination of
modality-specialized VLMs with few-shot adaptation has provided fruitful
results, enabling the efficient deployment of high-performing solutions.
However, previous works on this topic make strong assumptions about the
distribution of adaptation data, which are unrealistic in the medical domain.
First, prior art assumes access to a balanced support set, a condition that
breaks the natural imbalance in disease prevalence found in real-world
scenarios. Second, these works typically assume the presence of an additional
validation set to fix critical hyper-parameters, which is highly
data-inefficient. This work challenges these favorable deployment scenarios and
introduces a realistic, imbalanced, validation-free adaptation setting. Our
extensive benchmark across various modalities and downstream tasks demonstrates
that current methods systematically compromise their performance when operating
under realistic conditions, occasionally even performing worse than zero-shot
inference. Also, we introduce a training-free linear probe that adaptively
blends visual and textual supervision. Detailed studies demonstrate that the
proposed solver is a strong, efficient baseline, enabling robust adaptation in
challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: SCA-T为医学VLM的迁移学习提供了一种更可靠和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented
transfer capabilities and are being increasingly adopted for data-efficient
image classification. Despite its growing popularity, its reliability aspect
remains largely unexplored. This work explores the split conformal prediction
(SCP) framework to provide trustworthiness guarantees when transferring such
models based on a small labeled calibration set. Despite its potential, the
generalist nature of the VLMs' pre-training could negatively affect the
properties of the predicted conformal sets for specific tasks. While common
practice in transfer learning for discriminative purposes involves an
adaptation stage, we observe that deploying such a solution for conformal
purposes is suboptimal since adapting the model using the available calibration
data breaks the rigid exchangeability assumptions for test data in SCP. To
address this issue, we propose transductive split conformal adaptation (SCA-T),
a novel pipeline for transfer learning on conformal scenarios, which performs
an unsupervised transductive adaptation jointly on calibration and test data.
We present comprehensive experiments utilizing medical VLMs across various
image modalities, transfer tasks, and non-conformity scores. Our framework
offers consistent gains in efficiency and conditional coverage compared to SCP,
maintaining the same empirical guarantees.

Abstract: Despite its importance for performance and injury prevention, golf swing
analysis is limited by isolated metrics, underrepresentation of professional
athletes, and a lack of rich, interpretable movement representations. We
address these gaps with a holistic, data-driven framework for personalized golf
swing analysis from a single wrist-worn sensor. We build a large dataset of
professional swings from publicly available videos, reconstruct full-body 3D
kinematics using biologically accurate human mesh recovery, and generate
synthetic inertial data to train neural networks that infer motion and segment
swing phases from wrist-based input. We learn a compositional, discrete
vocabulary of motion primitives that facilitates the detection and
visualization of technical flaws, and is expressive enough to predict player
identity, club type, sex, and age. Our system accurately estimates full-body
kinematics and swing events from wrist data, delivering lab-grade motion
analysis on-course and supporting early detection of anomalous movement
patterns. Explainability methods reveal subtle, individualized movement
signatures, reinforcing the view that variability is a hallmark of skilled
performance. Longitudinal tracking demonstrates practical value: as one
player's handicap improved from 50 to 2.2 over 1.5 years, our system captured
measurable technical progress and provided targeted, actionable feedback. Our
findings challenge common assumptions, such as swing consistency across clubs
and the existence of a single "ideal" swing, and uncover latent biomarkers
shaped by both intrinsic traits and task-specific constraints. This work
bridges lab and field-based biomechanics, offering scalable, accessible,
high-fidelity motion analysis for research, coaching, and injury prevention,
while opening new directions in movement-based phenotyping, personalized
equipment design, and motor skill development.

Result: Scene-R1在多个数据集上超越现有基线，提供透明的逐步推理。

Conclusion: 强化学习结合RGB-D视频提供了一种高效且可信的3D场景理解方法。

Abstract: Currently, utilizing large language models to understand the 3D world is
becoming popular. Yet existing 3D-aware LLMs act as black boxes: they output
bounding boxes or textual answers without revealing how those decisions are
made, and they still rely on pre-trained 3D detectors to supply object
proposals. We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to
reason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by
pairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding
pipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video
and select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query. In the
subsequent image grounding stage, we analyze the image and predict the 2D
bounding box. After that, we track the object using SAM2 to produce
pixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, and project them back into 3D, thereby
eliminating the need for 3D detector-based proposals while capturing fine
geometry and material cues. Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question
answering task to answer free-form questions directly from video. Our training
pipeline only needs task-level 2D boxes or textual labels without dense 3D
point-wise labels. Scene-R1 surpasses existing open-vocabulary baselines on
multiple datasets, while delivering transparent, step-by-step rationales. These
results show that reinforcement-learning-based reasoning combined with RGB-D
video alone offers a practical, annotation-efficient route to trustworthy 3D
scene understanding.

Abstract: Learning to infer object representations, and in particular part-whole
hierarchies, has been the focus of extensive research in computer vision, in
pursuit of improving data efficiency, systematic generalisation, and
robustness. Models which are \emph{designed} to infer part-whole hierarchies,
often referred to as capsule networks, are typically trained end-to-end on
supervised tasks such as object classification, in which case it is difficult
to evaluate whether such a model \emph{actually} learns to infer part-whole
hierarchies, as claimed. To address this difficulty, we present a SYNthetic
DAtaset for CApsule Testing and Evaluation, abbreviated as SynDaCaTE, and
establish its utility by (1) demonstrating the precise bottleneck in a
prominent existing capsule model, and (2) demonstrating that
permutation-equivariant self-attention is highly effective for parts-to-wholes
inference, which motivates future directions for designing effective inductive
biases for computer vision.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型在任务规划和动作生成上的方法差异大，难以确定性能提升的具体来源。本文旨在系统研究不同规划和表示的影响。

Method: 提出VLA-OS架构，支持多种任务规划范式，并设计全面的实验，涵盖不同对象类别、视觉模态、环境和末端执行器。

Result: 视觉基础规划表示优于语言规划表示；分层VLA范式在任务性能、预训练、泛化能力等方面表现更优，但训练和推理速度较慢。

Conclusion: 分层VLA范式和视觉基础规划表示是提升VLA模型性能的有效方法，但需权衡速度与性能。

Abstract: Recent studies on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shifted from the
end-to-end action-generation paradigm toward a pipeline involving task planning
followed by action generation, demonstrating improved performance on various
complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches vary
significantly in terms of network architectures, planning paradigms,
representations, and training data sources, making it challenging for
researchers to identify the precise sources of performance gains and components
to be further improved. To systematically investigate the impacts of different
planning paradigms and representations isolating from network architectures and
training data, in this paper, we introduce VLA-OS, a unified VLA architecture
series capable of various task planning paradigms, and design a comprehensive
suite of controlled experiments across diverse object categories (rigid and
deformable), visual modalities (2D and 3D), environments (simulation and
real-world), and end-effectors (grippers and dexterous hands). Our results
demonstrate that: 1) visually grounded planning representations are generally
better than language planning representations; 2) the Hierarchical-VLA paradigm
generally achieves superior or comparable performance than other paradigms on
task performance, pretraining, generalization ability, scalability, and
continual learning ability, albeit at the cost of slower training and inference
speeds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedMRG是一个基于联邦学习的框架，用于隐私保护的多中心LLM驱动的医学报告生成，解决了通信效率和多模态数据异质性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像-报告数据分散且隐私受限，阻碍了LLM驱动的医学报告生成模型的开发。

Method: 采用低秩分解减少通信开销，结合客户端感知对比学习和双适配器机制处理数据异质性。

Result: FedMRG在通信效率和临床报告准确性方面表现优异，适用于多中心数据。

Conclusion: FedMRG为多中心LLM驱动的医学报告生成提供了高效、隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in Medical Report Generation
(MRG), yet their development requires large amounts of medical image-report
pairs, which are commonly scattered across multiple centers. Centralizing these
data is exceptionally challenging due to privacy regulations, thereby impeding
model development and broader adoption of LLM-driven MRG models. To address
this challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated
Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of
LLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge
of communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity.
To start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication
overhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently
decompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs
and making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings.
Furthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario:
varying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse
reporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further
enhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder,
coupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally
generalizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic
accuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder
that harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in
reporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our
established FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and
adaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center
data and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication
efficiency.

TL;DR: HalluRNN通过引入Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit（DG-DPU）模块，以架构层面的解决方案减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，仅需微调DG-DPU模块即可在多基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）易产生视觉不真实的幻觉输出，现有方法通常需要大量资源或任务特定配置，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出HalluRNN架构，采用DG-DPU模块进行跨层循环推理，自适应传播信息并增强层间一致性。

Result: 仅微调DG-DPU模块的HalluRNN在多个基准测试中表现出色且稳健。

Conclusion: HalluRNN通过架构创新有效减少幻觉问题，且资源需求低，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across various tasks, they are still prone to
hallucinations-generating outputs that are textually plausible but visually
ungrounded. While prior approaches generally address this issue through
data-centric fine-tuning or innovative decoding strategies, these methods often
require substantial resources or task-specific configurations. In this work, we
introduce an architecture-level solution, HalluRNN, which enhances model
stability through recurrent cross-layer reasoning. Specifically, we propose a
novel Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU) module, which is shared across
layers and recurrently refines hidden states. This allows for the adaptive
propagation of information throughout the model, enforces consistency across
layers, and mitigates hallucinations caused by representational drift. By
fine-tuning only the DG-DPU module, HalluRNN achieves strong and robust
performance across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决现有基准测试在安全关键场景下多类意图预测评估的不足。

Method: 通过自动化标注流程构建DRAMA-X数据集，并提出轻量级框架SGG-Intent，结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型进行推理。

Result: 实验表明，基于场景图的推理能显著提升意图预测和风险评估的准确性。

Conclusion: DRAMA-X为自动驾驶决策提供了结构化评估工具，场景图推理方法具有潜力。

Abstract: Understanding the short-term motion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) like
pedestrians and cyclists is critical for safe autonomous driving, especially in
urban scenarios with ambiguous or high-risk behaviors. While vision-language
models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for
fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing
benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical
situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark
constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline.
DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding
boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores,
expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion
summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four
interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection,
intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference
baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that
mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene
graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses
risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by
a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing
performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment,
especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度伪造检测中身份特征使用引发的争议：一方面身份特征可能引入偏见，另一方面可作为有效证据。论文旨在明确身份特征的判别性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出SELFI框架，包括Forgery-Aware Identity Adapter（FAIA）提取身份嵌入，Identity-Aware Fusion Module（IAFM）选择性融合身份与视觉特征。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，SELFI平均AUC提升3.1%，在DFDC数据集上超过之前最佳方法6%。

Conclusion: 身份特征应被显式建模并动态调节，而非盲目抑制或依赖。SELFI框架展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Face identity provides a powerful signal for deepfake detection. Prior
studies show that even when not explicitly modeled, classifiers often learn
identity features implicitly. This has led to conflicting views: some suppress
identity cues to reduce bias, while others rely on them as forensic evidence.
To reconcile these views, we analyze two hypotheses: (1) whether face identity
alone is discriminative for detecting deepfakes, and (2) whether such identity
features generalize poorly across manipulation methods. Our experiments confirm
that identity is informative but context-dependent. While some manipulations
preserve identity-consistent artifacts, others distort identity cues and harm
generalization. We argue that identity features should neither be blindly
suppressed nor relied upon, but instead be explicitly modeled and adaptively
controlled based on per-sample relevance. We propose \textbf{SELFI}
(\textbf{SEL}ective \textbf{F}usion of \textbf{I}dentity), a generalizable
detection framework that dynamically modulates identity usage. SELFI consists
of: (1) a Forgery-Aware Identity Adapter (FAIA) that extracts identity
embeddings from a frozen face recognition model and projects them into a
forgery-relevant space via auxiliary supervision; and (2) an Identity-Aware
Fusion Module (IAFM) that selectively integrates identity and visual features
using a relevance-guided fusion mechanism. Experiments on four benchmarks show
that SELFI improves cross-manipulation generalization, outperforming prior
methods by an average of 3.1\% AUC. On the challenging DFDC dataset, SELFI
exceeds the previous best by 6\%. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: 帕金森病（PD）的不可治愈性、快速进展和严重残疾对患者及其家庭构成重大挑战，早期检测需求增加。现有体外诊断方法存在数据不足、设备要求高和单模态风险等问题。

Method: 采用轻量级深度学习模型进行特征提取和融合，结合面部表情和步态数据，提高诊断准确性并便于移动设备部署。

Result: 建立了最大的多模态PD数据集，并通过实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态方法在PD早期检测中具有潜力，解决了现有方法的局限性，并展示了实际应用的可能性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by its incurable nature, rapid
progression, and severe disability, poses significant challenges to the lives
of patients and their families. Given the aging population, the need for early
detection of PD is increasing. In vitro diagnosis has garnered attention due to
its non-invasive nature and low cost. However, existing methods present several
challenges: 1) limited training data for facial expression diagnosis; 2)
specialized equipment and acquisition environments required for gait diagnosis,
resulting in poor generalizability; 3) the risk of misdiagnosis or missed
diagnosis when relying on a single modality. To address these issues, we
propose a novel multimodal in vitro diagnostic method for PD, leveraging facial
expressions and behavioral gait. Our method employs a lightweight deep learning
model for feature extraction and fusion, aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy
and facilitating deployment on mobile devices. Furthermore, we have established
the largest multimodal PD dataset in collaboration with a hospital and
conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Motivation: 开发一个可解释且对人口统计学和技术差异具有鲁棒性的脑年龄预测模型。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，结合自监督预训练，处理伪3D T1加权MRI扫描，并通过茎架构降低计算复杂度。模型在ADNI2 & 3和OASIS3数据集上训练，并在AIBL数据集上验证。

Result: 在测试集上MAE为3.65年，泛化能力MAE为3.54年。脑年龄差（BAG）与认知能力显著相关，关键区域为脑室和白质结构。

Conclusion: 模型融合多视角和体积信息，实现了高精度、泛化能力强且可解释的脑年龄预测，与神经退行性疾病相关。

Abstract: Purpose: To develop an age prediction model which is interpretable and robust
to demographic and technological variances in brain MRI scans. Materials and
Methods: We propose a transformer-based architecture that leverages
self-supervised pre-training on large-scale datasets. Our model processes
pseudo-3D T1-weighted MRI scans from three anatomical views and incorporates
brain volumetric information. By introducing a stem architecture, we reduce the
conventional quadratic complexity of transformer models to linear complexity,
enabling scalability for high-dimensional MRI data. We trained our model on
ADNI2 $\&$ 3 (N=1348) and OASIS3 (N=716) datasets (age range: 42 - 95) from the
North America, with an 8:1:1 split for train, validation and test. Then, we
validated it on the AIBL dataset (N=768, age range: 60 - 92) from Australia.
Results: We achieved an MAE of 3.65 years on ADNI2 $\&$ 3 and OASIS3 test set
and a high generalizability of MAE of 3.54 years on AIBL. There was a notable
increase in brain age gap (BAG) across cognitive groups, with mean of 0.15
years (95% CI: [-0.22, 0.51]) in CN, 2.55 years ([2.40, 2.70]) in MCI, 6.12
years ([5.82, 6.43]) in AD. Additionally, significant negative correlation
between BAG and cognitive scores was observed, with correlation coefficient of
-0.185 (p < 0.001) for MoCA and -0.231 (p < 0.001) for MMSE. Gradient-based
feature attribution highlighted ventricles and white matter structures as key
regions influenced by brain aging. Conclusion: Our model effectively fused
information from different views and volumetric information to achieve
state-of-the-art brain age prediction accuracy, improved generalizability and
interpretability with association to neurodegenerative disorders.

Motivation: 高分辨率图像特征在多模态大语言模型中表现优异，但计算成本高昂，需多次调用大型图像编码器。

Method: 提出浅层特征增强器，通过特征上采样生成高分辨率特征，减少计算负担。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在训练和推理时间上大幅减少，计算成本降低1.5倍FLOPs，同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 浅层特征增强器是一种高效的高分辨率特征生成方法，显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: The integration of high-resolution image features in modern multimodal large
language models has demonstrated significant improvements in fine-grained
visual understanding tasks, achieving high performance across multiple
benchmarks. Since these features are obtained from large image encoders like
ViT, they come with a significant increase in computational costs due to
multiple calls to these encoders. In this work, we first develop an intuition
for feature upsampling as a natural extension of high-resolution feature
generation. Through extensive experiments and ablations, we demonstrate how a
shallow feature enricher can achieve competitive results with tremendous
reductions in training and inference time as well as computational cost, with
upto 1.5x saving in FLOPs.

Motivation: 解决专业修图工具操作复杂和现有AI解决方案调整性差的问题，满足个性化修图需求。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：Chain-of-Thought监督微调建立基础推理能力，GRPO-R优化决策和工具使用；提出Agent-to-Lightroom协议实现与Lightroom的无缝集成。

Result: 在MMArt-Bench上，JarvisArt在内容保真度上比GPT-4o提升60%，同时保持指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: JarvisArt为智能修图开辟了新途径，具备用户友好、泛化能力强和精细控制的特点。

Abstract: Photo retouching has become integral to contemporary visual storytelling,
enabling users to capture aesthetics and express creativity. While professional
tools such as Adobe Lightroom offer powerful capabilities, they demand
substantial expertise and manual effort. In contrast, existing AI-based
solutions provide automation but often suffer from limited adjustability and
poor generalization, failing to meet diverse and personalized editing needs. To
bridge this gap, we introduce JarvisArt, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM)-driven agent that understands user intent, mimics the reasoning process
of professional artists, and intelligently coordinates over 200 retouching
tools within Lightroom. JarvisArt undergoes a two-stage training process: an
initial Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning to establish basic reasoning
and tool-use skills, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization for
Retouching (GRPO-R) to further enhance its decision-making and tool
proficiency. We also propose the Agent-to-Lightroom Protocol to facilitate
seamless integration with Lightroom. To evaluate performance, we develop
MMArt-Bench, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world user edits.
JarvisArt demonstrates user-friendly interaction, superior generalization, and
fine-grained control over both global and local adjustments, paving a new
avenue for intelligent photo retouching. Notably, it outperforms GPT-4o with a
60% improvement in average pixel-level metrics on MMArt-Bench for content
fidelity, while maintaining comparable instruction-following capabilities.

Motivation: 解决EVR中复杂指令多样性和长时视频动态性的挑战，弥补现有方法在视觉细节和逐步推理上的不足。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在处理长时视觉依赖方面。

Conclusion: CLiViS通过LLMs和VLMs的协同作用，有效提升了视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Embodied Visual Reasoning (EVR) seeks to follow complex, free-form
instructions based on egocentric video, enabling semantic understanding and
spatiotemporal reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite its promising
potential, EVR encounters significant challenges stemming from the diversity of
complex instructions and the intricate spatiotemporal dynamics in long-term
egocentric videos. Prior solutions either employ Large Language Models (LLMs)
over static video captions, which often omit critical visual details, or rely
on end-to-end Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that struggle with stepwise
compositional reasoning. Consider the complementary strengths of LLMs in
reasoning and VLMs in perception, we propose CLiViS. It is a novel
training-free framework that leverages LLMs for high-level task planning and
orchestrates VLM-driven open-world visual perception to iteratively update the
scene context. Building on this synergy, the core of CLiViS is a dynamic
Cognitive Map that evolves throughout the reasoning process. This map
constructs a structured representation of the embodied scene, bridging
low-level perception and high-level reasoning. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLiViS,
especially in handling long-term visual dependencies. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对立体深度估计（SDE）的物理可实现、场景自适应且可迁移的攻击方法PatchHunter，通过强化学习生成视觉模式，优于传统优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SDE模型对抗攻击多限于不现实的数字扰动，缺乏实际应用性，需设计更现实的攻击方法。

Method: 提出PatchHunter，一种无优化的对抗补丁攻击，通过强化学习搜索视觉模式空间，干扰SDE核心假设。

Result: PatchHunter在KITTI、CARLA和真实车辆部署中表现优异，攻击成功率高且迁移性强，优于优化方法。

Conclusion: PatchHunter为SDE攻击提供了高效、可迁移的解决方案，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: Stereo Depth Estimation (SDE) is essential for scene understanding in
vision-based systems like autonomous driving. However, recent studies show that
SDE models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are often limited to
unrealistic settings, e.g., digital perturbations on separate stereo views in
static scenes, restricting their real-world applicability. This raises a
critical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and
transferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?
  To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified
attack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages
of stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost
aggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation
across 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,
reveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.
Interestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather
than pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks. Motivated
by this, we present PatchHunter, the first optimization-free adversarial patch
attack against SDE. PatchHunter formulates patch generation as a reinforcement
learning-driven search over a structured space of visual patterns crafted to
disrupt SDE assumptions.
  We validate PatchHunter across three levels: the KITTI dataset, the CARLA
simulator, and real-world vehicle deployment. PatchHunter not only surpasses
optimization-based methods in effectiveness but also achieves significantly
better black-box transferability. Even under challenging physical conditions
like low light, PatchHunter maintains high attack success (e.g., D1-all > 0.4),
whereas optimization-based methods fail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OOD检测方法需要大量IID样本训练，限制了实际应用。少样本OOD检测更具挑战性，且现有方法忽略了类间多样性。

Method: 提出AMCN网络，结合CLIP模型，生成自适应文本提示（可学习的ID提示和OOD提示），并通过类间阈值和提示引导模块优化ID-OOD分离边界。

Result: 实验表明AMCN优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: AMCN通过自适应提示和类间分布学习，有效解决了少样本OOD检测问题。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection attempts to distinguish outlier samples
to prevent models trained on the in-distribution (ID) dataset from producing
unavailable outputs. Most OOD detection methods require many IID samples for
training, which seriously limits their real-world applications. To this end, we
target a challenging setting: few-shot OOD detection, where {Only a few {\em
labeled ID} samples are available.} Therefore, few-shot OOD detection is much
more challenging than the traditional OOD detection setting. Previous few-shot
OOD detection works ignore the distinct diversity between different classes. In
this paper, we propose a novel network: Adaptive Multi-prompt Contrastive
Network (AMCN), which adapts the ID-OOD separation boundary by learning inter-
and intra-class distribution. To compensate for the absence of OOD and scarcity
of ID {\em image samples}, we leverage CLIP, connecting text with images,
engineering learnable ID and OOD {\em textual prompts}. Specifically, we first
generate adaptive prompts (learnable ID prompts, label-fixed OOD prompts and
label-adaptive OOD prompts). Then, we generate an adaptive class boundary for
each class by introducing a class-wise threshold. Finally, we propose a
prompt-guided ID-OOD separation module to control the margin between ID and OOD
prompts. Experimental results show that AMCN outperforms other state-of-the-art
works.

Abstract: Automating medical report generation from histopathology images is a critical
challenge requiring effective visual representations and domain-specific
knowledge. Inspired by the common practices of human experts, we propose an
in-context learning framework called PathGenIC that integrates context derived
from the training set with a multimodal in-context learning (ICL) mechanism.
Our method dynamically retrieves semantically similar whole slide image
(WSI)-report pairs and incorporates adaptive feedback to enhance contextual
relevance and generation quality. Evaluated on the HistGen benchmark, the
framework achieves state-of-the-art results, with significant improvements
across BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics, and demonstrates robustness across
diverse report lengths and disease categories. By maximizing training data
utility and bridging vision and language with ICL, our work offers a solution
for AI-driven histopathology reporting, setting a strong foundation for future
advancements in multimodal clinical applications.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在解码时对图像标记的敏感性导致幻觉现象，需解决这一问题以提高模型可靠性。

Method: 提出Memory-Driven Sparse Attention Matrix (MDSAM)，动态捕获和优化每层图像标记的注意力分配，通过记忆和激活更新减少幻觉。

Result: 在图像描述和视觉问答等任务中，MDSAM能持续减少幻觉并提升可靠性，且兼容多种模型架构。

Conclusion: MDSAM是一种无需额外训练或外部工具的有效方法，能显著减少幻觉现象。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) often stem from the
model's sensitivity to image tokens during decoding, as evidenced by attention
peaks observed when generating both real and hallucinated entities. To address
this, we propose Memory-Driven Sparse Attention Matrix (MDSAM) , a novel
training-free approach that dynamically captures and refines the attention
allocated to image tokens at each layer. MDSAM memorizes attention patterns and
activates updates through alignment during decoding, enhancing focus on
relevant image tokens while effectively reducing hallucinations. We evaluate
MDSAM on multiple benchmarks for tasks such as image captioning and visual
question answering, demonstrating its ability to consistently reduce
hallucinations and improve reliability. Compatible with various LVLM
architectures, MDSAM highlights its adaptability and effectiveness in
mitigating hallucinations without requiring additional training or external
tools.

*Wei Haolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer的检测头CSDN，通过新颖的门控机制替代传统自注意力和交叉注意力层，以更高效地利用CNN主干网络的特征，提升目标检测的全局上下文建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在目标检测中因有限的感受野而难以捕捉全局上下文信息，且DETR架构中的自注意力机制存在信息冗余问题。

Method: 引入CSDN，采用门控机制自适应选择和组合多注意力模式的特征维度和尺度信息。

Result: CSDN显著提升了检测精度，且仅需少量微调即可适配多种CNN检测器。

Conclusion: CSDN通过高效特征利用和全局上下文建模，为目标检测提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have long been the cornerstone of target
detection, but they are often limited by limited receptive fields, which
hinders their ability to capture global contextual information. This paper
believes that the effective utilization of extracted features is as important
as the feature extraction process itself. We critically re-evaluated the
DETR-inspired header network architecture, questioning the indispensable nature
of its self-attention mechanism, and discovering significant information
redundancies. To solve these problems, we introduced the Context-Gated
Scale-Adaptive Detection Network (CSDN), a Transformer-based detection header
inspired by natural language processing architecture and human visual
perception. CSDN aims to efficiently utilize the characteristics of the CNN
backbone network by replacing the traditional stacked self-attention and
cross-attention layers with a novel gating mechanism. This mechanism enables
each region of interest (ROI) to adaptively select and combine feature
dimensions and scale information from multiple attention patterns. CSDN
provides more powerful global context modeling capabilities and can better
adapt to objects of different sizes and structures. Our proposed detection head
can directly replace the native heads of various CNN-based detectors, and only
a few rounds of fine-tuning on the pre-training weights can significantly
improve the detection accuracy, thus avoiding the need to achieve small
improvements. Various layer modules undergo extensive re-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决第一人称视角动作识别模型在未见训练环境中的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出SeqDG方法，包含视觉-文本序列重建（SeqRec）和跨域动作序列混合训练（SeqMix）。

Result: 在EPIC-KITCHENS-100上跨域识别提升2.4%，在EGTEA上域内识别提升0.6%。

Conclusion: SeqDG通过序列建模和跨域训练有效提升了动作识别的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recognizing human activities from visual inputs, particularly through a
first-person viewpoint, is essential for enabling robots to replicate human
behavior. Egocentric vision, characterized by cameras worn by observers,
captures diverse changes in illumination, viewpoint, and environment. This
variability leads to a notable drop in the performance of Egocentric Action
Recognition models when tested in environments not seen during training. In
this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a domain generalization
approach for Egocentric Action Recognition. Our insight is that action
sequences often reflect consistent user intent across visual domains. By
leveraging action sequences, we aim to enhance the model's generalization
ability across unseen environments. Our proposed method, named SeqDG,
introduces a visual-text sequence reconstruction objective (SeqRec) that uses
contextual cues from both text and visual inputs to reconstruct the central
action of the sequence. Additionally, we enhance the model's robustness by
training it on mixed sequences of actions from different domains (SeqMix). We
validate SeqDG on the EGTEA and EPIC-KITCHENS-100 datasets. Results on
EPIC-KITCHENS-100, show that SeqDG leads to +2.4% relative average improvement
in cross-domain action recognition in unseen environments, and on EGTEA the
model achieved +0.6% Top-1 accuracy over SOTA in intra-domain action
recognition.

Result: 实验表明，该方法无需标注数据即可实现竞争性性能，同时降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架在计算效率和模态缺失鲁棒性方面表现优异，为音频-视觉说话人验证提供了新思路。

Abstract: Conventional audio-visual methods for speaker verification rely on large
amounts of labeled data and separate modality-specific architectures, which is
computationally expensive, limiting their scalability. To address these
problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework based on contrastive
learning with asymmetric masking and masked data modeling to obtain robust
audiovisual feature representations. In particular, we employ a unified
framework for self-supervised audiovisual speaker verification using a single
shared backbone for audio and visual inputs, leveraging the versatility of
vision transformers. The proposed unified framework can handle audio, visual,
or audiovisual inputs using a single shared vision transformer backbone during
training and testing while being computationally efficient and robust to
missing modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance without labeled data while reducing computational costs
compared to traditional approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamJourney提出了一种两阶段框架，利用视频扩散模型生成动态场景视图，解决了现有方法在3D感知和动态对象运动方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于2D扩散模型，缺乏3D感知且无法处理动态对象运动，导致生成视图存在扭曲和静态场景限制。

Method: 第一阶段将输入图像转换为3D点云并渲染部分图像序列，利用视频扩散模型补全缺失区域；第二阶段通过多模态大语言模型生成对象运动描述，并用视频扩散模型动画化视图。

Result: 实验表明，DreamJourney在定量和定性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DreamJourney通过结合3D感知和动态对象运动，实现了高质量的动态场景视图生成。

Abstract: Perpetual view generation aims to synthesize a long-term video corresponding
to an arbitrary camera trajectory solely from a single input image. Recent
methods commonly utilize a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to
synthesize new content of previously unseen regions along camera movement.
However, the underlying 2D diffusion model lacks 3D awareness and results in
distorted artifacts. Moreover, they are limited to generating views of static
3D scenes, neglecting to capture object movements within the dynamic 4D world.
To alleviate these issues, we present DreamJourney, a two-stage framework that
leverages the world simulation capacity of video diffusion models to trigger a
new perpetual scene view generation task with both camera movements and object
dynamics. Specifically, in stage I, DreamJourney first lifts the input image to
3D point cloud and renders a sequence of partial images from a specific camera
trajectory. A video diffusion model is then utilized as generative prior to
complete the missing regions and enhance visual coherence across the sequence,
producing a cross-view consistent video adheres to the 3D scene and camera
trajectory. Meanwhile, we introduce two simple yet effective strategies (early
stopping and view padding) to further stabilize the generation process and
improve visual quality. Next, in stage II, DreamJourney leverages a multimodal
large language model to produce a text prompt describing object movements in
current view, and uses video diffusion model to animate current view with
object movements. Stage I and II are repeated recurrently, enabling perpetual
dynamic scene view generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our DreamJourney over state-of-the-art methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Our project page:

Motivation: 为了解决通过自然语言精确控制3D房间属性的挑战，将复杂任务分解为多个简单步骤，并通过统一框架支持多样化任务。

Method: 框架结合视觉编程（VP）和预训练扩散模型，分解任务为生成3D坐标、全景图像、构建网格和家具布置，利用双向LSTM优化全景图像生成。

Result: 展示了框架在生成和编辑3D房间网格上的灵活性，并在定量和定性上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Programmable-Room通过模块化设计和视觉编程，实现了高效且高质量的3D房间生成与编辑。

Abstract: We present Programmable-Room, a framework which interactively generates and
edits a 3D room mesh, given natural language instructions. For precise control
of a room's each attribute, we decompose the challenging task into simpler
steps such as creating plausible 3D coordinates for room meshes, generating
panorama images for the texture, constructing 3D meshes by integrating the
coordinates and panorama texture images, and arranging furniture. To support
the various decomposed tasks with a unified framework, we incorporate visual
programming (VP). VP is a method that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to
write a Python-like program which is an ordered list of necessary modules for
the various tasks given in natural language. We develop most of the modules.
Especially, for the texture generating module, we utilize a pretrained
large-scale diffusion model to generate panorama images conditioned on text and
visual prompts (i.e., layout, depth, and semantic map) simultaneously.
Specifically, we enhance the panorama image generation quality by optimizing
the training objective with a 1D representation of a panorama scene obtained
from bidirectional LSTM. We demonstrate Programmable-Room's flexibility in
generating and editing 3D room meshes, and prove our framework's superiority to
an existing model quantitatively and qualitatively. Project page is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PDC-Net的新方法，用于从MRI中准确分割骨盆辐射损伤（PRI），通过多方向聚合模块和记忆引导上下文模块提升分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 骨盆辐射损伤（PRI）的精确分割对预后评估和个性化治疗计划至关重要，但自动化分割因器官形态复杂和上下文混淆而具有挑战性。

Method: PDC-Net采用分而治之策略，包括多方向聚合模块（MDA）增强形状拟合，记忆引导上下文模块（MGC）提升全局模式区分，以及自适应融合解码器（AFD）动态选择特征。

Result: 在首个大规模骨盆辐射损伤数据集上的实验表明，PDC-Net优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PDC-Net通过创新的模块设计和动态特征选择，显著提升了PRI分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of Pelvic Radiation Injury (PRI) from Magnetic
Resonance Images (MRI) is crucial for more precise prognosis assessment and the
development of personalized treatment plans. However, automated segmentation
remains challenging due to factors such as complex organ morphologies and
confusing context. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Pattern
Divide-and-Conquer Network (PDC-Net) for PRI segmentation. The core idea is to
use different network modules to "divide" various local and global patterns
and, through flexible feature selection, to "conquer" the Regions of Interest
(ROI) during the decoding phase. Specifically, considering that our ROI often
manifests as strip-like or circular-like structures in MR slices, we introduce
a Multi-Direction Aggregation (MDA) module. This module enhances the model's
ability to fit the shape of the organ by applying strip convolutions in four
distinct directions. Additionally, to mitigate the challenge of confusing
context, we propose a Memory-Guided Context (MGC) module. This module
explicitly maintains a memory parameter to track cross-image patterns at the
dataset level, thereby enhancing the distinction between global patterns
associated with the positive and negative classes. Finally, we design an
Adaptive Fusion Decoder (AFD) that dynamically selects features from different
patterns based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, ultimately generating
the final segmentation results. We evaluate our method on the first large-scale
pelvic radiation injury dataset, and the results demonstrate the superiority of
our PDC-Net over existing approaches.

TL;DR: YOLOv13通过HyperACE机制和FullPAD范式，解决了YOLO系列模型在全局多对多高阶相关性建模上的不足，提升了复杂场景下的检测性能，同时减少了参数和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: YOLO系列模型在实时目标检测中表现出色，但缺乏全局多对多高阶相关性建模能力，限制了复杂场景下的检测性能。

Method: 提出HyperACE机制和FullPAD范式，利用超图计算实现全局特征融合，并采用深度可分离卷积减少参数和计算量。

Result: 在MS COCO基准测试中，YOLOv13-N的mAP比YOLO11-N和YOLOv12-N分别提高了3.0%和1.5%，且参数和FLOPs更少。

Conclusion: YOLOv13通过创新机制和优化设计，实现了高效、轻量化的目标检测，性能优于前代模型。

Abstract: The YOLO series models reign supreme in real-time object detection due to
their superior accuracy and computational efficiency. However, both the
convolutional architectures of YOLO11 and earlier versions and the area-based
self-attention mechanism introduced in YOLOv12 are limited to local information
aggregation and pairwise correlation modeling, lacking the capability to
capture global multi-to-multi high-order correlations, which limits detection
performance in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose YOLOv13, an
accurate and lightweight object detector. To address the above-mentioned
challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-based Adaptive Correlation Enhancement
(HyperACE) mechanism that adaptively exploits latent high-order correlations
and overcomes the limitation of previous methods that are restricted to
pairwise correlation modeling based on hypergraph computation, achieving
efficient global cross-location and cross-scale feature fusion and enhancement.
Subsequently, we propose a Full-Pipeline Aggregation-and-Distribution (FullPAD)
paradigm based on HyperACE, which effectively achieves fine-grained information
flow and representation synergy within the entire network by distributing
correlation-enhanced features to the full pipeline. Finally, we propose to
leverage depthwise separable convolutions to replace vanilla large-kernel
convolutions, and design a series of blocks that significantly reduce
parameters and computational complexity without sacrificing performance. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO benchmark, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Specifically, our YOLOv13-N
improves mAP by 3.0\% over YOLO11-N and by 1.5\% over YOLOv12-N. The code and
models of our YOLOv13 model are available at:

Abstract: Transforming static images into interactive experiences remains a challenging
task in computer vision. Tackling this challenge holds the potential to elevate
mobile user experiences, notably through interactive and AR/VR applications.
Current approaches aim to achieve this either using pre-recorded video
responses or requiring multi-view images as input. In this paper, we present
PhysID, that streamlines the creation of physics-based interactive dynamics
from a single-view image by leveraging large generative models for 3D mesh
generation and physical property prediction. This significantly reduces the
expertise required for engineering-intensive tasks like 3D modeling and
intrinsic property calibration, enabling the process to be scaled with minimal
manual intervention. We integrate an on-device physics-based engine for
physically plausible real-time rendering with user interactions. PhysID
represents a leap forward in mobile-based interactive dynamics, offering
real-time, non-deterministic interactions and user-personalization with
efficient on-device memory consumption. Experiments evaluate the zero-shot
capabilities of various Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse
tasks and the performance of 3D reconstruction models. These results
demonstrate the cohesive functioning of all modules within the end-to-end
framework, contributing to its effectiveness.

Conclusion: LoLA-SpecViT为高光谱图像应用提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案，适用于农业、环境监测和遥感分析。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality of spectral data, significant inter-band redundancy, and the
limited availability of annotated samples. While recent transformer-based
models have improved the global modeling of spectral-spatial dependencies,
their scalability and adaptability under label-scarce conditions remain
limited. In this work, we propose \textbf{LoLA-SpecViT}(Low-rank adaptation
Local Attention Spectral Vision Transformer), a lightweight spectral vision
transformer that addresses these limitations through a parameter-efficient
architecture tailored to the unique characteristics of hyperspectral imagery.
Our model combines a 3D convolutional spectral front-end with local
window-based self-attention, enhancing both spectral feature extraction and
spatial consistency while reducing computational complexity. To further improve
adaptability, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) into attention and
projection layers, enabling fine-tuning with over 80\% fewer trainable
parameters. A novel cyclical learning rate scheduler modulates LoRA adaptation
strength during training, improving convergence and generalisation. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets WHU-Hi LongKou, WHU-Hi HongHu, and
Salinas demonstrate that LoLA-SpecViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving up to 99.91\% accuracy with substantially fewer parameters
and enhanced robustness under low-label regimes. The proposed framework
provides a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world HSI applications
in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing analytics. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在皮肤疾病诊断中存在对不同人口群体的偏见，导致不公平的医疗结果和患者信任下降。现有方法在消除偏见时往往牺牲准确性。

Method: 提出FairMoE框架，利用分层混合专家模块作为群体特定学习器，动态路由数据以处理群体边界附近的案例。

Result: 实验表明，FairMoE在保持公平性指标的同时显著提高了准确性，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: FairMoE为AI在医疗领域的公平性提供了一种有效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: AI-based systems have achieved high accuracy in skin disease diagnostics but
often exhibit biases across demographic groups, leading to inequitable
healthcare outcomes and diminished patient trust. Most existing bias mitigation
methods attempt to eliminate the correlation between sensitive attributes and
diagnostic prediction, but those methods often degrade performance due to the
lost of clinically relevant diagnostic cues. In this work, we propose an
alternative approach that incorporates sensitive attributes to achieve
fairness. We introduce FairMoE, a framework that employs layer-wise
mixture-of-experts modules to serve as group-specific learners. Unlike
traditional methods that rigidly assign data based on group labels, FairMoE
dynamically routes data to the most suitable expert, making it particularly
effective for handling cases near group boundaries. Experimental results show
that, unlike previous fairness approaches that reduce performance, FairMoE
achieves substantial accuracy improvements while preserving comparable fairness
metrics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Temporal的自监督目标，用于视觉上下文学习（ICL），通过将其重新定义为视频对象分割（VOS）任务，解决了传统网格方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流ICL方法依赖网格策略，缺乏视觉应用所需的灵活性，限制了上下文图像的数量和分辨率。

Method: 提出Temporal自监督目标，预训练提示检索器，将ICL重新定义为VOS任务，支持可变数量的上下文图像并保留其分辨率。

Result: 在MICCAI FLARE 2022上，图像分割Dice得分提升10.64%至90.95%，视频分割提升14.88%至92.45%。

Conclusion: 通过Temporal方法，ICL在视觉任务中表现出更高的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables generalization to new tasks with minimal
labeled data. However, mainstream ICL approaches rely on a gridding strategy,
which lacks the flexibility required for vision applications. We introduce
Temporal, a time-contrastive self-supervised objective that pretrains a prompt
retriever for visual ICL, and formulate ICL as a video object segmentation
(VOS) task. Temporal addresses key limitations of grid-based methods that
restrict the number and resolution of context images. By reframing ICL as a VOS
problem, our approach supports a variable number of context images while
preserving their full resolution. To address the challenge of selecting optimal
context sets for queries, we pretrain a prompt retriever on videos via
self-supervised learning, where adjacent frames serve as positives and distant
frames as negatives. For image segmentation, the prompt retriever selects
relevant sequences that, when combined with the query, form coherent videos for
VOS processing. For video segmentation, it identifies keyframes, predicts their
masks using our ICL pipeline, and propagates them throughout the sequence. When
evaluated on MICCAI FLARE 2022, our method achieves substantial improvements
over baselines: 90.95% Dice score for image segmentation (10.64% improvement)
and 92.45% Dice for video segmentation (14.88% improvement).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FBS方法无法准确分离低质量视频中的前景和背景，因为它们仅捕获特定或通用特征，且未明确建模多种噪声。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在红外和显微镜视频中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新方法能有效分离低帧率多噪声视频中的前景和背景。

Abstract: This paper proposes a foreground-background separation (FBS) method with a
novel foreground model based on convolutional sparse representation (CSR). In
order to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under
undesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,
it is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low
frame rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two
limitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and
background components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture
either data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not
include explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS
process. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based
foreground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures
scattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex
optimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general
features, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of
noise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and
general features to accurately separate the components from various types of
noise even under low frame rates. To obtain a solution of the optimization
problem, we develop an algorithm that alternately solves its two convex
subproblems by newly established algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method over existing methods using two types of degraded
videos: infrared and microscope videos.

Motivation: 现有方法（关键点或体分割）在胎儿MRI分析中存在局限性，无法同时兼顾运动分析和完整形状信息。

Method: 构建3D统计体模型，迭代估计图像空间中的姿态和规范姿态空间中的形状，提高对MRI伪影的鲁棒性。

Result: 模型在测试中实现了3.2 mm的表面对齐误差，并支持自动人体测量。

Conclusion: 该模型是首个3D胎儿统计体模型，为产前诊断中的运动和形状分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Analyzing fetal body motion and shape is paramount in prenatal diagnostics
and monitoring. Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis mainly rely on
anatomical keypoints or volumetric body segmentations. Keypoints simplify body
structure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of
full-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but
complicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements. To address
these limitations, we construct a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model
based on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). Our algorithm
iteratively estimates body pose in the image space and body shape in the
canonical pose space. This approach improves robustness to MRI motion artifacts
and intensity distortions, and reduces the impact of incomplete surface
observations due to challenging fetal poses. We train our model on
segmentations and keypoints derived from $19,816$ MRI volumes across $53$
subjects. Our model captures body shape and motion across time series and
provides intuitive visualization. Furthermore, it enables automated
anthropometric measurements traditionally difficult to obtain from
segmentations and keypoints. When tested on unseen fetal body shapes, our
method yields a surface alignment error of $3.2$ mm for $3$ mm MRI voxel size.
To our knowledge, this represents the first 3D articulated statistical fetal
body model, paving the way for enhanced fetal motion and shape analysis in
prenatal diagnostics. The code is available at

TL;DR: CM-SSM是一种高效的RGB-热数据语义分割架构，通过跨模态状态空间建模（SSM）降低计算开销，优于基于Transformer的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在野外环境中，RGB和热数据的融合能显著提升语义分割性能，但现有方法（如基于Transformer的方法）计算开销大，难以在资源受限系统中应用。

Method: 提出CM-SSM架构，包含跨模态2D选择性扫描（CM-SS2D）模块和跨模态状态空间关联（CM-SSA）模块，实现线性计算复杂度。

Result: 在CART和PST900数据集上，CM-SSM以更少的参数和更低计算成本达到最优性能。

Conclusion: CM-SSM是一种高效且通用的RGB-热数据语义分割解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of RGB and thermal data can significantly improve semantic
segmentation performance in wild environments for field robots. Nevertheless,
multi-source data processing (e.g. Transformer-based approaches) imposes
significant computational overhead, presenting challenges for
resource-constrained systems. To resolve this critical limitation, we
introduced CM-SSM, an efficient RGB-thermal semantic segmentation architecture
leveraging a cross-modal state space modeling (SSM) approach. Our framework
comprises two key components. First, we introduced a cross-modal
2D-selective-scan (CM-SS2D) module to establish SSM between RGB and thermal
modalities, which constructs cross-modal visual sequences and derives hidden
state representations of one modality from the other. Second, we developed a
cross-modal state space association (CM-SSA) module that effectively integrates
global associations from CM-SS2D with local spatial features extracted through
convolutional operations. In contrast with Transformer-based approaches, CM-SSM
achieves linear computational complexity with respect to image resolution.
Experimental results show that CM-SSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the CART dataset with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Further
experiments on the PST900 dataset demonstrate its generalizability. Codes are
available at https://github.com/xiaodonguo/CMSSM.

Result: 实验表明SurgVidLM在全景和精细视频理解任务中显著优于现有Vid-LLMs。

Conclusion: SurgVidLM填补了精细手术视频理解的空白，展示了在复杂手术场景中的优越性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated great
potential in the medical domain, facilitating users to understand surgical
scenes and procedures. Beyond image-based methods, the exploration of Video
Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) has emerged as a promising avenue for
capturing the complex sequences of information involved in surgery. However,
there is still a lack of Vid-LLMs specialized for fine-grained surgical video
understanding tasks, which is crucial for analyzing specific processes or
details within a surgical procedure. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVidLM,
the first video language model designed to address both full and fine-grained
surgical video comprehension. To train our SurgVidLM, we construct the SVU-31K
dataset which consists of over 31K video-instruction pairs, enabling both
holistic understanding and detailed analysis of surgical procedures.
Furthermore, we introduce the StageFocus mechanism which is a two-stage
framework performing the multi-grained, progressive understanding of surgical
videos. We also develop the Multi-frequency Fusion Attention to effectively
integrate low and high-frequency visual tokens, ensuring the retention of
critical information. Experimental results demonstrate that SurgVidLM
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs in both full and
fine-grained video understanding tasks, showcasing its superior capability in
capturing complex procedural contexts.

Motivation: 病理图像的颜色差异可能影响计算机辅助诊断系统的性能，因此需要一种有效的染色归一化方法。

Method: 将图像解耦为结构特征和向量量化的颜色特征，利用固定颜色向量代码本和交叉注意力机制重新染色结构特征。

Result: 实验验证了StainPIDR和模板图像选择算法的有效性，表明该方法在染色归一化任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: StainPIDR能有效解决病理图像的染色差异问题，提升计算机辅助诊断系统的性能。

Abstract: The color appearance of a pathological image is highly related to the imaging
protocols, the proportion of different dyes, and the scanning devices.
Computer-aided diagnostic systems may deteriorate when facing these
color-variant pathological images. In this work, we propose a stain
normalization method called StainPIDR. We try to eliminate this color
discrepancy by decoupling the image into structure features and
vector-quantized color features, restaining the structure features with the
target color features, and decoding the stained structure features to
normalized pathological images. We assume that color features decoupled by
different images with the same color should be exactly the same. Under this
assumption, we train a fixed color vector codebook to which the decoupled color
features will map. In the restaining part, we utilize the cross-attention
mechanism to efficiently stain the structure features. As the target color
(decoupled from a selected template image) will also affect the performance of
stain normalization, we further design a template image selection algorithm to
select a template from a given dataset. In our extensive experiments, we
validate the effectiveness of StainPIDR and the template image selection
algorithm. All the results show that our method can perform well in the stain
normalization task. The code of StainPIDR will be publicly available later.

Abstract: Cloud contamination significantly impairs the usability of optical satellite
imagery, affecting critical applications such as environmental monitoring,
disaster response, and land-use analysis. This research presents a
Cloud-Attentive Reconstruction Framework that integrates SAR-optical feature
fusion with deep learning-based image reconstruction to generate cloud-free

fusion mechanism to align complementary structural information from Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) with spectral characteristics from optical data.
Furthermore, a cloud-aware model update strategy introduces adaptive loss
weighting to prioritize cloud-occluded regions, enhancing reconstruction
accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
existing approaches, achieving a PSNR of 31.01 dB, SSIM of 0.918, and MAE of

Result: 在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: Relation3D通过增强关系建模，显著提升了3D实例分割的效果。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation aims to predict a set of object instances in a
scene, representing them as binary foreground masks with corresponding semantic
labels. Currently, transformer-based methods are gaining increasing attention
due to their elegant pipelines and superior predictions. However, these methods
primarily focus on modeling the external relationships between scene features
and query features through mask attention. They lack effective modeling of the
internal relationships among scene features as well as between query features.
In light of these disadvantages, we propose \textbf{Relation3D: Enhancing
Relation Modeling for Point Cloud Instance Segmentation}. Specifically, we
introduce an adaptive superpoint aggregation module and a contrastive
learning-guided superpoint refinement module to better represent superpoint
features (scene features) and leverage contrastive learning to guide the
updates of these features. Furthermore, our relation-aware self-attention
mechanism enhances the capabilities of modeling relationships between queries
by incorporating positional and geometric relationships into the self-attention
mechanism. Extensive experiments on the ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, ScanNet200 and
S3DIS datasets demonstrate the superior performance of Relation3D.

Abstract: Conveyor belt is a category of important equipments in modern industry,
widely applied in production and manufacturing Fields. Its health status is
much critical to operation efficiency and safety hazards. Among the factors
affecting belt health, crack is often one of the most threatening risks.
Currently, considering safety, how to intelligently detect belt cracks is
catching an increasing attention. To implement the intelligent detection with
machine learning, real crack samples are believed to be necessary. However,
existing crack datasets primarily focus on pavement scenarios or synthetic
data, no real-world industrial belt crack datasets at all. To propel machine
learning advancement in this field, this paper constructs the first
sequential-image belt crack detection datasets (BeltCrack14ks and
BeltCrack9kd), from real-world factory scenes. Furthermore, to validate
usability and effectiveness, we propose a special baseline method with
triple-domain (i.e., time-space-frequency) feature hierarchical fusion learning
for the two whole-new datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the
availability and effectiveness of our dataset. Besides, they also show that our
baseline is obviously superior to other similar detection methods. Our datasets

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有外中心到自我中心的转换方法依赖2D线索、多视图同步设置和不现实的假设，限制了应用。

Method: EgoWorld通过估计外中心深度图重建点云，再投影到自我中心视角，并应用扩散修复生成密集图像。

Result: 在H2O和TACO数据集上表现优异，对新对象、动作、场景和主体具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EgoWorld在无标签真实世界示例中也展现出潜力，为AR、VR和机器人应用提供了新可能。

Abstract: Egocentric vision is essential for both human and machine visual
understanding, particularly in capturing the detailed hand-object interactions
needed for manipulation tasks. Translating third-person views into first-person
views significantly benefits augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and
robotics applications. However, current exocentric-to-egocentric translation
methods are limited by their dependence on 2D cues, synchronized multi-view
settings, and unrealistic assumptions such as necessity of initial egocentric
frame and relative camera poses during inference. To overcome these challenges,
we introduce EgoWorld, a novel two-stage framework that reconstructs an
egocentric view from rich exocentric observations, including projected point
clouds, 3D hand poses, and textual descriptions. Our approach reconstructs a
point cloud from estimated exocentric depth maps, reprojects it into the
egocentric perspective, and then applies diffusion-based inpainting to produce
dense, semantically coherent egocentric images. Evaluated on the H2O and TACO
datasets, EgoWorld achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates
robust generalization to new objects, actions, scenes, and subjects. Moreover,
EgoWorld shows promising results even on unlabeled real-world examples.

TL;DR: MMGrounded-PostAlign是一个后多模态对齐框架，通过视觉和文本接地模块增强MLLMs的视觉理解能力并减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在视觉语言任务中过度依赖虚假相关性和语言先验的问题。

Method: 引入多模态接地模块（视觉接地和文本接地）和负拒绝机制，以及选择性推理机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升了细粒度视觉理解和幻觉抑制能力。

Conclusion: MMGrounded-PostAlign有效提升了MLLMs的视觉理解能力并减少了幻觉。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. However, they often suffer
from over-reliance on spurious correlations, primarily due to linguistic priors
that distract the model from leveraging actual visual information. To address
these issues, we introduce MMGrounded-PostAlign, a post-multimodal alignment
framework designed to enhance the visual understanding capabilities and
mitigate the hallucinations of MLLMs. Our framework incorporates a multimodal
grounding module for both visual grounding, which identifies the referred
object in the image, and textual grounding, which generates the rationale for
the final answer, ensuring that outputs are anchored in both visual and textual
evidence. To mitigate the hallucinations, we introduce a negative rejection
mechanism in the visual grounding module to distinguish grounded entities from
non-existent objects influenced by linguistic biases. On the textual grounding
side, we propose a selective reasoning mechanism that adjusts the model's
reasoning strategy based on query complexity. Extensive evaluations are
conducted on benchmarks such as POPE, HaloQuest, VQAv2, MME, and MMBench
showing significant improvements in fine-grained visual understanding and
hallucination suppression.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CEDO的框架，通过三种机制（MHO、GMS、DLR）从因果和效应角度全面减轻医学视觉问答模型中的语言偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉问答模型存在语言偏差问题，即问题类型与答案类别之间建立虚假关联。

Method: CEDO框架包含三种机制：MHO（模态驱动的异构优化）、GMS（梯度引导的模态协同）和DLR（分布适应的损失重缩放），分别从不同角度减轻偏差。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CEDO表现出优于现有方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CEDO通过综合优化机制有效减轻了语言偏差，提升了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Existing Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) models often suffer from
language biases, where spurious correlations between question types and answer
categories are inadvertently established. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Cause-Effect Driven Optimization framework called CEDO, that incorporates
three well-established mechanisms, i.e., Modality-driven Heterogeneous
Optimization (MHO), Gradient-guided Modality Synergy (GMS), and
Distribution-adapted Loss Rescaling (DLR), for comprehensively mitigating
language biases from both causal and effectual perspectives. Specifically, MHO
employs adaptive learning rates for specific modalities to achieve
heterogeneous optimization, thus enhancing robust reasoning capabilities.
Additionally, GMS leverages the Pareto optimization method to foster
synergistic interactions between modalities and enforce gradient orthogonality
to eliminate bias updates, thereby mitigating language biases from the effect
side, i.e., shortcut bias. Furthermore, DLR is designed to assign adaptive
weights to individual losses to ensure balanced learning across all answer
categories, effectively alleviating language biases from the cause side, i.e.,
imbalance biases within datasets. Extensive experiments on multiple traditional
and bias-sensitive benchmarks consistently demonstrate the robustness of CEDO
over state-of-the-art competitors.

Abstract: 2D cameras are often used in interactive systems. Other systems like gaming

Overall, these cameras are not reliable in large, complex environments. In this
work, we propose a 3D stereo vision based pipeline for interactive systems,
that is able to handle both ordinary and sensitive applications, through robust
scene understanding. We explore the fusion of multiple 3D cameras to do full
scene reconstruction, which allows for preforming a wide range of tasks, like
event recognition, subject tracking, and notification. Using possible feedback
approaches, the system can receive data from the subjects present in the
environment, to learn to make better decisions, or to adapt to completely new
environments. Throughout the paper, we introduce the pipeline and explain our
preliminary experimentation and results. Finally, we draw the roadmap for the
next steps that need to be taken, in order to get this pipeline into production

Motivation: 当前LLM在文本到运动生成中表现不佳，主要由于运动标记化的粒度问题导致局部依赖或细节丢失。

Method: 提出PlanMoGPT框架，结合渐进式规划和流增强的细粒度标记化，通过分层生成和增强解码器优化运动细节。

Result: 在长序列生成中FID分数提升63.8%，运动多样性增加49.9%，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: PlanMoGPT成功解决了多样性-质量的权衡问题，为文本到运动生成设定了新标准。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled breakthroughs in
many multimodal generation tasks, but a significant performance gap still
exists in text-to-motion generation, where LLM-based methods lag far behind
non-LLM methods. We identify the granularity of motion tokenization as a
critical bottleneck: fine-grained tokenization induces local dependency issues,
where LLMs overemphasize short-term coherence at the expense of global semantic
alignment, while coarse-grained tokenization sacrifices motion details. To
resolve this issue, we propose PlanMoGPT, an LLM-based framework integrating
progressive planning and flow-enhanced fine-grained motion tokenization. First,
our progressive planning mechanism leverages LLMs' autoregressive capabilities
to hierarchically generate motion tokens by starting from sparse global plans
and iteratively refining them into full sequences. Second, our flow-enhanced
tokenizer doubles the downsampling resolution and expands the codebook size by
eight times, minimizing detail loss during discretization, while a
flow-enhanced decoder recovers motion nuances. Extensive experiments on
text-to-motion benchmarks demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving FID scores by 63.8% (from 0.380 to 0.141) on
long-sequence generation while enhancing motion diversity by 49.9% compared to
existing methods. The proposed framework successfully resolves the
diversity-quality trade-off that plagues current non-LLM approaches,
establishing new standards for text-to-motion generation.

Method: 结合ResNet和FPN的深度结构，设计新型损失函数与现有损失函数的组合，优化训练。

Result: 在Office-Home、Office-31和VisDA-2017数据集上优于现有CNN方法，DomainNet数据集上表现相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在多模态分布对齐和训练效率上表现优异，适用于自然图像的域自适应任务。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for
natural images. A commonly-used objective for UDA schemes is to enhance domain
alignment in representation space even if there is a domain shift in the input
space. Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods may not effectively align
different domains of multimodal distributions associated with classification
problems. Our approach has two main features. Firstly, its neural architecture
uses the deep structure of ResNet and the effective separation of scales of
feature pyramidal network (FPN) to work with both content and style features.
Secondly, it uses a combination of a novel loss function and judiciously
selected existing loss functions to train the network architecture. This
tailored combination is designed to address challenges inherent to natural
images, such as scale, noise, and style shifts, that occur on top of a
multi-modal (multi-class) distribution. The combined loss function not only
enhances model accuracy and robustness on the target domain but also speeds up
training convergence. Our proposed UDA scheme generalizes better than
state-of-the-art for CNN-based methods on Office-Home, Office-31, and
VisDA-2017 datasets and comaparable for DomainNet dataset.

Abstract: Medical visual question answering aims to support clinical decision-making by
enabling models to answer natural language questions based on medical images.
While recent advances in multi-modal learning have significantly improved
performance, current methods still suffer from limited answer reliability and
poor interpretability, impairing the ability of clinicians and patients to
understand and trust model-generated answers. To address this, this work first
proposes a Thinking with Visual Grounding (ThinkVG) dataset wherein the answer
generation is decomposed into intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly
ground relevant visual regions of the medical image, thereby providing
fine-grained explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel verifiable
reward mechanism for reinforcement learning to guide post-training, improving
the alignment between the model's reasoning process and its final answer.
Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only one-eighth of
the training data, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the
proposal. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is widely used in a variety of fields such as
urban planning, terrain and geomorphology analysis, and environmental
monitoring, mainly by analyzing the significant change differences of features
(e.g., building changes) in the same spatial region at different time phases.
In this paper, we propose a large language model (LLM) augmented inference
approach (SegChange-R1), which enhances the detection capability by integrating
textual descriptive information and aims at guiding the model to segment the
more interested change regions, thus accelerating the convergence speed.
Moreover, we design a spatial transformation module (BEV) based on linear
attention, which solves the problem of modal misalignment in change detection
by unifying features from different temporal perspectives onto the BEV space.
In addition, we construct the first dataset for building change detection from
UAV viewpoints (DVCD ), and our experiments on four widely-used change

Motivation: 街头集市是许多地区的重要经济中心，但其非结构化特性使得帐篷等基础设施的自动分类具有挑战性。传统手动方法效率低下，而CNN在此类任务中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究使用了126张原始照片的数据集，通过数据增强生成更多图像，并比较了自定义CNN和EfficientNetB0的性能，评估指标包括准确率、精确率、召回率、F1分数和mAP。

Result: 自定义CNN达到92.8%的准确率，而EfficientNetB0达到98.4%，表明迁移学习在集市图像分类中效果显著。

Conclusion: 预训练模型如EfficientNetB0能显著提升分类准确性和泛化能力，适用于集市基础设施的自动分类任务。

Abstract: This research paper proposes an improved deep learning model for classifying
tents in street bazaars, comparing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
with EfficientNetB0. This is a critical task for market organization with a
tent classification, but manual methods in the past have been inefficient.
Street bazaars represent a vital economic hub in many regions, yet their
unstructured nature poses significant challenges for the automated
classification of market infrastructure, such as tents. In Kyrgyzstan, more
than a quarter of the country's GDP is derived from bazaars. While CNNs have
been widely applied to object recognition, their application to bazaar-specific
tasks remains underexplored. Here, we build upon our original approach by
training on an extended set of 126 original photographs that were augmented to
generate additional images. This dataset is publicly available for download on
Kaggle. A variety of performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall,
F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP), were used to assess the models
comparatively, providing a more extensive analysis of classification
performance.
  The results show that the CNN custom model achieved 92.8% accuracy, and
EfficientNetB0 showed 98.4% accuracy results, confirming the effectiveness of
transfer learning in the bazaar image classification. Also, when analyzing the
confusion matrix, the analysis reveals the weaknesses and strengths of each
model. These findings suggest that using a pre-trained model such as
EfficientNetB0 significantly improves classification accuracy and
generalization.

Abstract: This paper presents a newly developed mobile application designed to diagnose
Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) using the Mantoux Skin Test (TST).
Traditional TST methods often suffer from low follow-up return rates, patient
discomfort, and subjective manual interpretation, particularly with the
ball-point pen method, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Moreover,
previous developed mobile applications that used 3D reconstruction, this app
utilizes scaling stickers as reference objects for induration measurement. This
mobile application integrates advanced image processing technologies, including
ARCore, and machine learning algorithms such as DeepLabv3 for robust image
segmentation and precise measurement of skin indurations indicative of LTBI.
The system employs an edge detection algorithm to enhance accuracy. The
application was evaluated against standard clinical practices, demonstrating
significant improvements in accuracy and reliability. This innovation is
crucial for effective tuberculosis management, especially in resource-limited
regions. By automating and standardizing TST evaluations, the application
enhances the accessibility and efficiency of TB di-agnostics. Future work will
focus on refining machine learning models, optimizing measurement algorithms,
expanding functionalities to include comprehensive patient data management, and
enhancing ARCore's performance across various lighting conditions and
operational settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR和4D雷达在自动驾驶中各有优势，但现有研究常忽略多模态数据的对齐问题。本文旨在结合两者的优势，提升感知性能。

Method: 提出动态运动感知编码模块提取4D雷达的运动信息，并通过估计边界框的实例级不确定性来减少跨模态对齐误差。

Result: 在VoD数据集上，整个区域mAP达74.89%，驾驶走廊内达88.70%，实时推理速度为30.02 FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态对齐问题，显著提升了LiDAR检测性能，适用于实时自动驾驶应用。

Abstract: LiDAR and 4D radar are widely used in autonomous driving and robotics. While
LiDAR provides rich spatial information, 4D radar offers velocity measurement
and remains robust under adverse conditions. As a result, increasing studies
have focused on the 4D radar-LiDAR fusion method to enhance the perception.
However, the misalignment between different modalities is often overlooked. To
address this challenge and leverage the strengths of both modalities, we
propose a LiDAR detection framework enhanced by 4D radar motion status and
cross-modal uncertainty. The object movement information from 4D radar is first
captured using a Dynamic Motion-Aware Encoding module during feature extraction
to enhance 4D radar predictions. Subsequently, the instance-wise uncertainties
of bounding boxes are estimated to mitigate the cross-modal misalignment and
refine the final LiDAR predictions. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft
(VoD) dataset highlight the effectiveness of our method, achieving
state-of-the-art performance with the mAP of 74.89% in the entire area and
88.70% within the driving corridor while maintaining a real-time inference
speed of 30.02 FPS.

Motivation: 现有方法通常线性融合多尺度特征，未能充分捕捉失真对语义内容的影响。

Method: 利用CLIP模型，设计自底向上的多尺度交叉注意力模块，结合40个图像质量形容词的文本编码器。

Result: 在多数公开的FR和NR IQA基准测试中表现优异，且更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BPCLIP通过结合多尺度特征和语言表示，显著提升了图像质量评估的性能。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) aims to evaluate the perceptual quality of
images based on human subjective perception. Existing methods generally combine
multiscale features to achieve high performance, but most rely on
straightforward linear fusion of these features, which may not adequately
capture the impact of distortions on semantic content. To address this, we
propose a bottom-up image quality assessment approach based on the Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP, a recently proposed model that aligns images
and text in a shared feature space), named BPCLIP, which progressively extracts
the impact of low-level distortions on high-level semantics. Specifically, we
utilize an encoder to extract multiscale features from the input image and
introduce a bottom-up multiscale cross attention module designed to capture the
relationships between shallow and deep features. In addition, by incorporating
40 image quality adjectives across six distinct dimensions, we enable the
pre-trained CLIP text encoder to generate representations of the intrinsic
quality of the image, thereby strengthening the connection between image
quality perception and human language. Our method achieves superior results on
most public Full-Reference (FR) and No-Reference (NR) IQA benchmarks, while
demonstrating greater robustness.

Motivation: 合成数据在医学影像中具有隐私保护潜力，但现有方法在法律合规性和性能上存在不足。

Result: 合成数据性能接近真实数据（差距1%以内），显著优于不保护隐私的现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过最大化多样性实现隐私保护，同时提升合成数据的实用性和合规性。

Abstract: Synthetic data has recently reached a level of visual fidelity that makes it
nearly indistinguishable from real data, offering great promise for
privacy-preserving data sharing in medical imaging. However, fully synthetic
datasets still suffer from significant limitations: First and foremost, the
legal aspect of sharing synthetic data is often neglected and data regulations,
such as the GDPR, are largley ignored. Secondly, synthetic models fall short of
matching the performance of real data, even for in-domain downstream
applications. Recent methods for image generation have focused on maximising
image diversity instead of fidelity solely to improve the mode coverage and
therefore the downstream performance of synthetic data. In this work, we shift
perspective and highlight how maximizing diversity can also be interpreted as
protecting natural persons from being singled out, which leads to predicate
singling-out (PSO) secure synthetic datasets. Specifically, we propose a
generalisable framework for training diffusion models on personal data which
leads to unpersonal synthetic datasets achieving performance within one
percentage point of real-data models while significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods that do not ensure privacy. Our code is available at

present a fast and reliable neural inverse kinematics framework designed for
real-time capture of human body motions from 3D keypoints. We describe the

Our framework is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively, and we

Result: OSDMamba在两个公开数据集上分别取得8.9%和11.8%的性能提升，达到最优水平。

Conclusion: Mamba架构在油污检测中具有潜力，OSDMamba通过改进感受野和特征融合显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is commonly used for Oil Spill Detection (OSD) in
remote sensing images. However, the limited availability of labelled oil spill
samples and class imbalance present significant challenges that can reduce
detection accuracy. Furthermore, most existing methods, which rely on
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), struggle to detect small oil spill areas
due to their limited receptive fields and inability to effectively capture
global contextual information. This study explores the potential of State-Space
Models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, to overcome these limitations, building on
their recent success in vision applications. We propose OSDMamba, the first
Mamba-based architecture specifically designed for oil spill detection.
OSDMamba leverages Mamba's selective scanning mechanism to effectively expand
the model's receptive field while preserving critical details. Moreover, we
designed an asymmetric decoder incorporating ConvSSM and deep supervision to
strengthen multi-scale feature fusion, thereby enhancing the model's
sensitivity to minority class samples. Experimental results show that the
proposed OSDMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding improvements
of 8.9% and 11.8% in OSD across two publicly available datasets.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection has seen substantial advances in
recent years. However, existing works focus on the standard setting with ideal
images and natural distribution, far from practical scenarios with inevitable
distribution shifts. This hampers the practical applicability of HOI detection.
In this work, we investigate this issue by benchmarking, analyzing, and
enhancing the robustness of HOI detection models under various distribution
shifts. We start by proposing a novel automated approach to create the first
robustness evaluation benchmark for HOI detection. Subsequently, we evaluate
more than 40 existing HOI detection models on this benchmark, showing their
insufficiency, analyzing the features of different frameworks, and discussing
how the robustness in HOI is different from other tasks. With the insights from
such analyses, we propose to improve the robustness of HOI detection methods
through: (1) a cross-domain data augmentation integrated with mixup, and (2) a
feature fusion strategy with frozen vision foundation models. Both are simple,
plug-and-play, and applicable to various methods. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly increases the robustness
of various methods, with benefits on standard benchmarks, too. The dataset and
code will be released.

Abstract: This report introduces PP-DocBee2, an advanced version of the PP-DocBee,
designed to enhance multimodal document understanding. Built on a large
multimodal model architecture, PP-DocBee2 addresses the limitations of its
predecessor through key technological improvements, including enhanced
synthetic data quality, improved visual feature fusion strategy, and optimized
inference methodologies. These enhancements yield an $11.4\%$ performance boost
on internal benchmarks for Chinese business documents, and reduce inference
latency by $73.0\%$ to the vanilla version. A key innovation of our work is a
data quality optimization strategy for multimodal document tasks. By employing
a large-scale multimodal pre-trained model to evaluate data, we apply a novel
statistical criterion to filter outliers, ensuring high-quality training data.
Inspired by insights into underutilized intermediate features in multimodal
models, we enhance the ViT representational capacity by decomposing it into
layers and applying a novel feature fusion strategy to improve complex

Motivation: 解决WSI中空间异质性导致的组织分布分散问题，传统MIL方法难以有效建模跨区域空间交互。

Conclusion: MiCo有效提升了WSI分析中的跨区域组织关联和语义表达，为癌症诊断和预后提供了新工具。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown significant promise in
histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis for cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents
critical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often
dispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle
to model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional
spatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering
(MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and
strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by
clustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with
cluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional
intra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which
dynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via
feature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating
semantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate
semantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo
integrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while
enhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive
experiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Abstract: With the advancement of Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language

layer can process visual tokens for medical image segmentation tasks.
Specifically, we propose a simple hybrid structure that integrates a
pre-trained, frozen LLM layer within the CNN encoder-decoder segmentation
framework (LLM4Seg). Surprisingly, this design improves segmentation
performance with a minimal increase in trainable parameters across various
modalities, including ultrasound, dermoscopy, polypscopy, and CT scans. Our
in-depth analysis reveals the potential of transferring LLM's semantic
awareness to enhance segmentation tasks, offering both improved global
understanding and better local modeling capabilities. The improvement proves
robust across different LLMs, validated using LLaMA and DeepSeek.

Conclusion: CmFNet能有效缓解过拟合，提升分割性能，对临床治疗和多学科专家具有重要价值。

Abstract: Accurate automatic medical image segmentation relies on high-quality, dense
annotations, which are costly and time-consuming. Weakly supervised learning
provides a more efficient alternative by leveraging sparse and coarse
annotations instead of dense, precise ones. However, segmentation performance
degradation and overfitting caused by sparse annotations remain key challenges.
To address these issues, we propose CmFNet, a novel 3D weakly supervised
cross-modal medical image segmentation approach. CmFNet consists of three main
components: a modality-specific feature learning network, a cross-modal feature
learning network, and a hybrid-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, the
modality-specific feature learning network and the cross-modal feature learning
network effectively integrate complementary information from multi-modal
images, enhancing shared features across modalities to improve segmentation
performance. Additionally, the hybrid-supervised learning strategy guides
segmentation through scribble supervision, intra-modal regularization, and
inter-modal consistency, modeling spatial and contextual relationships while
promoting feature alignment. Our approach effectively mitigates overfitting,
delivering robust segmentation results. It excels in segmenting both
challenging small tumor regions and common anatomical structures. Extensive
experiments on a clinical cross-modal nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) dataset
(including CT and MR imaging) and the publicly available CT Whole Abdominal
Organ dataset (WORD) show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly
supervised methods. In addition, our approach also outperforms fully supervised
methods when full annotation is used. Our approach can facilitate clinical
therapy and benefit various specialists, including physicists, radiologists,
pathologists, and oncologists.

<details>

Motivation: SVLMs因参数规模小（≤2B）而具有低成本优势，但推理能力受限。本文旨在通过后训练优化提升其推理能力。

Method: 1. 构建自监督的COT数据系统；2. 通过四个阶段（SFT、格式对齐、推理增强、CLGRPO约束）逐步优化模型。

Result: 在EMOSet-118K数据集上，1B SVLM的准确率提升2.77，召回率提升0.69，性能接近8B模型。

Conclusion: 增量训练策略有效提升了SVLMs的推理能力，使其在低成本下达到接近更大模型的性能。

Abstract: Small Vision Language Models (SVLMs) generally refer to models with parameter
sizes less than or equal to 2B. Their low cost and power consumption
characteristics confer high commercial value. However, their reasoning
abilities are limited by the number of parameters. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a post-training optimization paradigm called the Incremental
Training Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of SVLMs. Firstly, we
constructed a Self-Supervised Chain-of-Thought (COT) Data Construction System,
which leverages multiple LVLMs with 7B parameters or more to transform original
data into COT data in a self-supervised manner. Our proposed Incremental
Training Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by
performing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT
data. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards
on the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training
on the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The
resulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline. Stage 4
addresses the limited capacity of the SVLMs and the weak ability to capture
complex patterns by proposing ClipLow GRPO (CLGRPO) to constrain the capture
space of the training process. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation
experiments on the abstract semantic recognition dataset EMOSet-118K.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the
reasoning ability of 1B SVLM. Compared to the baseline model fine-tuned on the
original data, accuracy increased by 2.77 and recall by 0.69, achieving
performance comparable to that of 8B models.

Conclusion: 深度学习模型在处理复杂几何形状（如小麦穗）时表现优于传统几何方法，形状对体积预测精度有显著影响。

Abstract: Estimating three-dimensional morphological traits from two-dimensional RGB
images presents inherent challenges due to the loss of depth information,
projection distortions, and occlusions under field conditions. In this work, we
explore multiple approaches for non-destructive volume estimation of wheat
spikes, using RGB image sequences and structured-light 3D scans as ground truth
references. Due to the complex geometry of the spikes, we propose a neural
network approach for volume estimation in 2D images, employing a transfer
learning pipeline that combines DINOv2, a self-supervised Vision Transformer,
with a unidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. By using deep
supervision, the model is able to learn more robust intermediate
representations, which enhances its generalisation ability across varying
evaluation sequences. We benchmark our model against two conventional
baselines: a 2D area-based projection and a geometric reconstruction using
axis-aligned cross-sections. Our deep supervised model achieves a mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE) of 6.46% on six-view indoor images, outperforming the
area (9.36%) and geometric (13.98%) baselines. Fine-tuning the model on
field-based single-image data enables domain adaptation, yielding a MAPE of
10.82%. We demonstrate that object shape significantly impacts volume
prediction accuracy, with irregular geometries such as wheat spikes posing
greater challenges for geometric methods compared to our deep learning
approach.

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image classification techniques are rapidly
advancing in medical image analysis, making it crucial to develop accurate and
trustworthy models that can be efficiently deployed across diverse clinical
scenarios. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which first predict a set of
explainable concepts from images and then perform classification based on these
concepts, are increasingly being adopted for explainable medical image
classification. However, the inherent explainability of CBMs introduces new
challenges when deploying trained models to new environments. Variations in
imaging protocols and staining methods may induce concept-level shifts, such as
alterations in color distribution and scale. Furthermore, since CBM training
requires explicit concept annotations, fine-tuning models solely with
image-level labels could compromise concept prediction accuracy and
faithfulness - a critical limitation given the high cost of acquiring
expert-annotated concept labels in medical domains. To address these
challenges, we propose a training-free confusion concept identification
strategy. By leveraging minimal new data (e.g., 4 images per class) with only
image-level labels, our approach enhances out-of-domain performance without
sacrificing source domain accuracy through two key operations: masking
misactivated confounding concepts and amplifying under-activated discriminative
concepts. The efficacy of our method is validated on both skin and white blood
cell images. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: MUPA在视频-语言理解中表现出高效性和可信性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Grounded Video Question Answering (Grounded VideoQA) requires aligning
textual answers with explicit visual evidence. However, modern multimodal
models often rely on linguistic priors and spurious correlations, resulting in
poorly grounded predictions. In this work, we propose MUPA, a cooperative
MUlti-Path Agentic approach that unifies video grounding, question answering,
answer reflection and aggregation to tackle Grounded VideoQA. MUPA features
three distinct reasoning paths on the interplay of grounding and QA agents in
different chronological orders, along with a dedicated reflection agent to
judge and aggregate the multi-path results to accomplish consistent QA and
grounding. This design markedly improves grounding fidelity without sacrificing
answer accuracy. Despite using only 2B parameters, our method outperforms all
7B-scale competitors. When scaled to 7B parameters, MUPA establishes new
state-of-the-art results, with Acc@GQA of 30.3% and 47.4% on NExT-GQA and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于单模态和低效架构，无法全面理解场景且难以实时部署。

Method: 提出MTS-Mamba子网络提取时空特征，结合MGMI模块自适应整合多模态特征。

Result: 在AIDE数据集上实现SOTA精度，参数量少于600万，推理速度达142.32 FPS。

Conclusion: TEM^3-Learning有效解决了多任务学习中的负迁移问题，并展示了高效性能。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) can advance assistive driving by exploring
inter-task correlations through shared representations. However, existing
methods face two critical limitations: single-modality constraints limiting
comprehensive scene understanding and inefficient architectures impeding
real-time deployment. This paper proposes TEM^3-Learning (Time-Efficient
Multimodal Multi-task Learning), a novel framework that jointly optimizes
driver emotion recognition, driver behavior recognition, traffic context
recognition, and vehicle behavior recognition through a two-stage architecture.
The first component, the mamba-based multi-view temporal-spatial feature
extraction subnetwork (MTS-Mamba), introduces a forward-backward temporal
scanning mechanism and global-local spatial attention to efficiently extract
low-cost temporal-spatial features from multi-view sequential images. The
second component, the MTL-based gated multimodal feature integrator (MGMI),
employs task-specific multi-gating modules to adaptively highlight the most
relevant modality features for each task, effectively alleviating the negative
transfer problem in MTL. Evaluation on the AIDE dataset, our proposed model
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across all four tasks, maintaining a
lightweight architecture with fewer than 6 million parameters and delivering an
impressive 142.32 FPS inference speed. Rigorous ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the independent
contributions of each module. The code is available on

Motivation: 当前先进的多模态生成模型（如GPT-4o-Image）多为专有且不可访问，研究团队希望通过开源数据集和模型推动开放研究。

Method: 使用GPT-4o生成合成数据集（45K文本到图像和46K文本和图像到图像数据），并基于此训练Janus-4o模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal generative models have unlocked photorealistic,
instruction-aligned image generation, yet leading systems like GPT-4o-Image
remain proprietary and inaccessible. To democratize these capabilities, we
present ShareGPT-4o-Image, the first dataset comprising 45K text-to-image and
46K text-and-image-to-image data, all synthesized using GPT-4o's image
generation capabilities for distilling its advanced image generation abilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we develop Janus-4o, a multimodal large language model
capable of both text-to-image and text-and-image-to-image generation. Janus-4o
not only significantly improves text-to-image generation over its predecessor,
Janus-Pro, but also newly supports text-and-image-to-image generation. Notably,
it achieves impressive performance in text-and-image-to-image generation from
scratch, using only 91K synthetic samples and 6 hours of training on an 8
A800-GPU machine. We hope the release of ShareGPT-4o-Image and Janus-4o will
foster open research in photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation.

TL;DR: 论文分析了VICReg在自监督学习中的潜在不足，提出改进方法SAG-VICReg，通过新训练技术提升泛化能力，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VICReg在泛化性上可能因过度依赖训练数据而表现不佳，研究旨在改进其泛化能力。

Method: 提出SAG-VICReg，通过新训练技术增强模型对全局语义的捕捉和泛化能力。

Result: SAG-VICReg在泛化性和全局语义理解上优于现有方法，同时保持局部指标的竞争力。

Conclusion: SAG-VICReg有效解决了VICReg的泛化问题，并提出新的无标签评估指标。

Abstract: In this paper, we argue that viewing VICReg-a popular self-supervised
learning (SSL) method--through the lens of spectral embedding reveals a
potential source of sub-optimality: it may struggle to generalize robustly to
unseen data due to overreliance on the training data. This observation invites
a closer look at how well this method achieves its goal of producing meaningful
representations of images outside of the training set as well. Here, we
investigate this issue and introduce SAG-VICReg (Stable and Generalizable
VICReg), a method that builds on VICReg by incorporating new training
techniques. These enhancements improve the model's ability to capture global
semantics within the data and strengthen the generalization capabilities.
Experiments demonstrate that SAG-VICReg effectively addresses the
generalization challenge while matching or surpassing diverse state-of-the-art
SSL baselines. Notably, our method exhibits superior performance on metrics
designed to evaluate global semantic understanding, while simultaneously
maintaining competitive results on local evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we
propose a new standalone evaluation metric for embeddings that complements the
standard evaluation methods and accounts for the global data structure without
requiring labels--a key issue when tagged data is scarce or not available.

Conclusion: 该方法为病变检测中的假阳性合成提供了新范式，推动了结直肠癌筛查的临床可靠性。

Abstract: Polyp detection is crucial for colorectal cancer screening, yet existing
models are limited by the scale and diversity of available data. While
generative models show promise for data augmentation, current methods mainly
focus on enhancing polyp diversity, often overlooking the critical issue of
false positives. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing an adversarial
diffusion framework to synthesize high-value false positives. The extensive
variability of negative backgrounds presents a significant challenge in false
positive synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce two key innovations: First,
we design a regional noise matching strategy to construct a negative synthesis
space using polyp detection datasets. This strategy trains a negative-centric
diffusion model by masking polyp regions, ensuring the model focuses
exclusively on learning diverse background patterns. Second, we introduce the
Detector-guided Adversarial Diffusion Attacker (DADA) module, which perturbs
the negative synthesis process to disrupt a pre-trained detector's decision,
guiding the negative-centric diffusion model to generate high-value,
detector-confusing false positives instead of low-value, ordinary backgrounds.
Our approach is the first to apply adversarial diffusion to lesion detection,
establishing a new paradigm for targeted false positive synthesis and paving
the way for more reliable clinical applications in colorectal cancer screening.
Extensive results on public and in-house datasets verify the superiority of our
method over the current state-of-the-arts, with our synthesized data improving
the detectors by at least 2.6% and 2.7% in F1-score, respectively, over the
baselines. Codes are at https://github.com/Huster-Hq/DADA.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合医学领域知识的视觉语言模型（VLM），通过引入比较分析机制，利用参考图像提升医学影像诊断的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学VLM缺乏比较分析能力，而通用VLM虽具备多图像比较能力但缺乏医学知识。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过提供查询图像和匹配的参考图像，结合临床启发的比较提示，对通用VLM进行监督微调（SFT）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了医学视觉问答（VQA）任务的性能，优于单图像基线。

Conclusion: 比较分析在医学诊断中具有临床价值，本文提出的策略为VLM在医学领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Medical imaging diagnosis presents inherent challenges due to diseases that
mimic normal anatomy and exhibit significant inter-patient variability.
Clinicians routinely employ comparative reasoning-using reference images from
healthy controls or previous patient examinations-to discern subtle yet
diagnostically critical abnormalities. However, existing medical
vision-language models (VLMs) focus primarily on single-image or single-series
analyses and lack explicit mechanisms for comparative reasoning. Conversely,
general-purpose VLMs demonstrate strong multi-image comparative reasoning
capabilities but lack essential medical-domain knowledge to identify nuanced
clinical differences. This work aims to bridge this gap by exploring
clinically-inspired comparative analysis within VLMs, leveraging reference
images to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Through extensive empirical analysis, we
show that providing general-purpose VLMs with query and normative matched
reference images, accompanied by clinically-informed comparative prompts,
significantly improves diagnostic outcomes compared to single-image baselines,
especially after supervised finetuning (SFT). Our contributions highlight the
clinical relevance of comparative analysis introduce novel strategies for
leveraging reference images in VLMs, empirically demonstrate enhanced
performance across multiple medical visual question answering (VQA) tasks, and
provide theoretical insights into the efficacy of comparative image analysis in
medical diagnosis.

Motivation: 传统方法在波长、尺寸或相关性上难以实现两相流的相位分离，因此探索基于图像模式的CNN方法。

Method: 利用卷积神经网络（如Faster R-CNN和YOLOv4）识别散焦粒子图像的模式差异，并通过生成对抗网络生成标注数据集。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集中，检测精度和分类准确率达到95-100%，即使存在领域偏移。

Conclusion: 证实了CNN在散焦粒子追踪测速中实现稳健相位分离的可行性，尤其在传统方法不适用时。

Abstract: This work investigates the feasibility of a post-processing-based approach
for phase separation in defocusing particle tracking velocimetry for dispersed
two-phase flows. The method enables the simultaneous 3D localization
determination of both tracer particles and particles of the dispersed phase,
using a single-camera setup. The distinction between phases is based on pattern
differences in defocused particle images, which arise from distinct light
scattering behaviors of tracer particles and bubbles or droplets. Convolutional
neural networks, including Faster R-CNN and YOLOv4 variants, are trained to
detect and classify particle images based on these pattern features. To
generate large, labeled training datasets, a generative adversarial network
based framework is introduced, allowing the generation of auto-labeled data
that more closely reflects experiment-specific visual appearance. Evaluation
across six datasets, comprising synthetic two-phase and real single- and
two-phase flows, demonstrates high detection precision and classification
accuracy (95-100%), even under domain shifts. The results confirm the viability
of using CNNs for robust phase separation in disperse two-phase DPTV,
particularly in scenarios where traditional wavelength-, size-, or ensemble
correlation-based methods are impractical.

Motivation: 解决密集对应学习中手动标注繁琐且不可扩展的问题，以及现有自监督方法中训练数据不足的挑战。

Method: 使用图像条件扩散模型生成多样化合成视图，并采用多锚点策略调整预训练任务的难度。

Result: CDG-MAE显著优于仅依赖图像的MAE方法，并大幅缩小了与基于视频方法的性能差距。

Conclusion: CDG-MAE通过合成视图和多锚点策略，为自监督学习提供了更丰富的训练信号，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Learning dense correspondences, critical for application such as video label
propagation, is hindered by tedious and unscalable manual annotation.
Self-supervised methods address this by using a cross-view pretext task, often
modeled with a masked autoencoder, where a masked target view is reconstructed
from an anchor view. However, acquiring effective training data remains a
challenge - collecting diverse video datasets is difficult and costly, while
simple image crops lack necessary pose variations. This paper introduces
CDG-MAE, a novel MAE-based self-supervised method that uses diverse synthetic
views generated from static images via an image-conditioned diffusion model.
These generated views exhibit substantial changes in pose and perspective,
providing a rich training signal that overcomes the limitations of video and
crop-based anchors. We present a quantitative method to evaluate local and
global consistency of generated images, discussing their use for cross-view
self-supervised pretraining. Furthermore, we enhance the standard single-anchor
MAE setting to a multi-anchor strategy to effectively modulate the difficulty
of pretext task. CDG-MAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MAE methods
reliant only on images and substantially narrows the performance gap to
video-based approaches.

Conclusion: 该模型能减少良性结节活检，同时保持对恶性肿瘤的高敏感性，有望改善临床决策和患者预后。

Abstract: Thyroid cancer is among the most common cancers in the United States. Thyroid
nodules are frequently detected through ultrasound (US) imaging, and some
require further evaluation via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Despite its
effectiveness, FNA often leads to unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules,
causing patient discomfort and anxiety. To address this, the American College
of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) has been
developed to reduce benign biopsies. However, such systems are limited by
interobserver variability. Recent deep learning approaches have sought to
improve risk stratification, but they often fail to utilize the rich temporal
and spatial context provided by US cine clips, which contain dynamic global
information and surrounding structural changes across various views. In this
work, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid
Ultrasound Time Series Classification (STACT-Time) model, a novel
representation learning framework that integrates imaging features from US cine
clips with features from segmentation masks automatically generated by a
pretrained model. By leveraging self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms,
our model captures the rich temporal and spatial context of US cine clips while
enhancing feature representation through segmentation-guided learning. Our
model improves malignancy prediction compared to state-of-the-art models,
achieving a cross-validation precision of 0.91 (plus or minus 0.02) and an F1
score of 0.89 (plus or minus 0.02). By reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign
nodules while maintaining high sensitivity for malignancy detection, our model
has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient
outcomes.

Result: 在PlantVillage数据集上，5-shot、10-shot和15-shot分类准确率分别为89.06%、92.46%和94.07%，80-shot分类准确率达98.09%。

Conclusion: DExNet在少样本条件下表现优异，显著降低数据需求，优于现有方法。

Abstract: While deep learning-based architectures have been widely used for correctly
detecting and classifying plant diseases, they require large-scale datasets to
learn generalized features and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This poses
a challenge for such models to obtain satisfactory performance in classifying
leaf diseases with limited samples. This work proposes a few-shot learning
framework, Domain-adapted Expert Network (DExNet), for plant disease
classification that compensates for the lack of sufficient training data by
combining observations of a number of expert critics. It starts with extracting
the feature embeddings as 'observations' from nine 'critics' that are
state-of-the-art pre-trained CNN-based architectures. These critics are 'domain
adapted' using a publicly available leaf disease dataset having no overlapping
classes with the specific downstream task of interest. The observations are
then passed to the 'Feature Fusion Block' and finally to a classifier network
consisting of Bi-LSTM layers. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on the 10
classes of tomato leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset, achieving
promising accuracies of 89.06%, 92.46%, and 94.07%, respectively, for 5-shot,
10-shot, and 15-shot classification. Furthermore, an accuracy of 98.09+-0.7%
has been achieved in 80-shot classification, which is only 1.2% less than
state-of-the-art, allowing a 94.5% reduction in the training data requirement.
The proposed pipeline also outperforms existing works on leaf disease
classification with limited data in both laboratory and real-life conditions in
single-domain, mixed-domain, and cross-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: FMF-SLAM在复杂环境中具有实时性和高效性，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Visual SLAM is particularly challenging in environments affected by noise,
varying lighting conditions, and darkness. Learning-based optical flow
algorithms can leverage multiple modalities to address these challenges, but
traditional optical flow-based visual SLAM approaches often require significant
computational resources.To overcome this limitation, we propose FMF-SLAM, an
efficient multimodal fusion SLAM method that utilizes fast Fourier transform
(FFT) to enhance the algorithm efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Fourier-based self-attention and cross-attention mechanism to extract features
from RGB and depth signals. We further enhance the interaction of multimodal
features by incorporating multi-scale knowledge distillation across modalities.
We also demonstrate the practical feasibility of FMF-SLAM in real-world
scenarios with real time performance by integrating it with a security robot by
fusing with a global positioning module GNSS-RTK and global Bundle Adjustment.
Our approach is validated using video sequences from TUM, TartanAir, and our
real-world datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art performance under noisy,
varying lighting, and dark conditions.Our code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: DINO增强的NeRF模型在极端少样本场景下表现不如基线NeRF，PSNR值更低，表明预训练视觉特征可能不适合少样本3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练视觉特征（如DINO）在少样本3D重建中的有效性，特别是在极端少样本场景下。

Method: 系统评估了基线NeRF、冻结DINO特征、LoRA微调特征和多尺度特征融合的DINO增强NeRF模型。

Result: 所有DINO变体表现均不如基线NeRF，PSNR值更低（12.9-13.0 vs. 14.71）。

Conclusion: 预训练视觉特征可能对少样本3D重建无益，甚至引入有害偏差，建议关注几何一致性的简单架构。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized 3D scene reconstruction
from sparse image collections. Recent work has explored integrating pre-trained
vision features, particularly from DINO, to enhance few-shot reconstruction
capabilities. However, the effectiveness of such approaches remains unclear,
especially in extreme few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we present a
systematic evaluation of DINO-enhanced NeRF models, comparing baseline NeRF,
frozen DINO features, LoRA fine-tuned features, and multi-scale feature fusion.
Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that all DINO variants perform worse than
the baseline NeRF, achieving PSNR values around 12.9 to 13.0 compared to the
baseline's 14.71. This counterintuitive result suggests that pre-trained vision
features may not be beneficial for few-shot 3D reconstruction and may even
introduce harmful biases. We analyze potential causes including feature-task
mismatch, overfitting to limited data, and integration challenges. Our findings
challenge common assumptions in the field and suggest that simpler
architectures focusing on geometric consistency may be more effective for
few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法可高精度自动化KA评估，为数字化临床工作流程提供了新可能。

Abstract: Radiographic knee alignment (KA) measurement is important for predicting
joint health and surgical outcomes after total knee replacement. Traditional
methods for KA measurements are manual, time-consuming and require long-leg
radiographs. This study proposes a deep learning-based method to measure KA in
anteroposterior knee radiographs via automatically localized knee anatomical
landmarks. Our method builds on hourglass networks and incorporates an
attention gate structure to enhance robustness and focus on key anatomical
features. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based method to
localize over 100 knee anatomical landmarks to fully outline the knee shape
while integrating KA measurements on both pre-operative and post-operative
images. It provides highly accurate and reliable anatomical varus/valgus KA
measurements using the anatomical tibiofemoral angle, achieving mean absolute
differences ~1{\deg} when compared to clinical ground truth measurements.
Agreement between automated and clinical measurements was excellent
pre-operatively (intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.97) and good
post-operatively (ICC = 0.86). Our findings demonstrate that KA assessment can
be automated with high accuracy, creating opportunities for digitally enhanced
clinical workflows.

Conclusion: 研究为LWIR偏振形状估计提供了新方法，并建立了首个真实世界基准数据集。

Abstract: Shape estimation for transparent objects is challenging due to their complex
light transport. To circumvent these difficulties, we leverage the Shape from
Polarization (SfP) technique in the Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) spectrum, where
most materials are opaque and emissive. While a few prior studies have explored
LWIR SfP, these attempts suffered from significant errors due to inadequate
polarimetric modeling, particularly the neglect of reflection. Addressing this
gap, we formulated a polarization model that explicitly accounts for the
combined effects of emission and reflection. Based on this model, we estimated
surface normals using not only a direct model-based method but also a
learning-based approach employing a neural network trained on a
physically-grounded synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we modeled the LWIR
polarimetric imaging process, accounting for inherent systematic errors to
ensure accurate polarimetry. We implemented a prototype system and created
ThermoPol, the first real-world benchmark dataset for LWIR SfP. Through
comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the high accuracy and broad
applicability of our method across various materials, including those
transparent in the visible spectrum.

Abstract: Early and accurate identification of retinal ailments is crucial for averting
ocular decline; however, access to dependable diagnostic devices is not often
available in low-resourced settings. This project proposes to solve that by
developing a lightweight, edge-device deployable disease classifier using
cross-architecture knowledge distilling. We first train a high-capacity vision
transformer (ViT) teacher model, pre-trained using I-JEPA self-supervised
learning, to classify fundus images into four classes: Normal, Diabetic
Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Cataract. We kept an Internet of Things (IoT) focus
when compressing to a CNN-based student model for deployment in
resource-limited conditions, such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. This was
accomplished using a novel framework which included a Partitioned
Cross-Attention (PCA) projector, a Group-Wise Linear (GL) projector, and a
multi-view robust training method. The teacher model has 97.4 percent more
parameters than the student model, with it achieving 89 percent classification
with a roughly 93 percent retention of the teacher model's diagnostic
performance. The retention of clinical classification behavior supports our
method's initial aim: compression of the ViT while retaining accuracy. Our work
serves as an example of a scalable, AI-driven triage solution for retinal
disorders in under-resourced areas.

*Xunzhi Xiang,Qi Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的动态稀疏注意力方法（ADSA），优化图像生成中的注意力计算，减少内存消耗和计算延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型在长上下文推理时存在内存和计算效率问题，需要优化注意力机制。

Method: 通过动态识别关键历史令牌，结合动态KV缓存更新机制，减少注意力计算开销。

Result: 实验表明ADSA在生成质量和资源效率上均表现优越，内存消耗降低约50%。

Conclusion: ADSA为图像生成提供了一种高效且无需训练的上下文优化方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive conditional image generation models have emerged as a dominant
paradigm in text-to-image synthesis. These methods typically convert images
into one-dimensional token sequences and leverage the self-attention mechanism,
which has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, to
capture long-range dependencies, model global context, and ensure semantic
coherence. However, excessively long contexts during inference lead to
significant memory overhead caused by KV-cache and computational delays. To
alleviate these challenges, we systematically analyze how global semantics,
spatial layouts, and fine-grained textures are formed during inference, and
propose a novel training-free context optimization method called Adaptive
Dynamic Sparse Attention (ADSA). Conceptually, ADSA dynamically identifies
historical tokens crucial for maintaining local texture consistency and those
essential for ensuring global semantic coherence, thereby efficiently
streamlining attention computation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic
KV-cache update mechanism tailored for ADSA, reducing GPU memory consumption
during inference by approximately $50\%$. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our
approach in terms of both generation quality and resource efficiency.

*Yue Li,Meng Tian,Dechang Zhu,Jiangtong Zhu,Zhenyu Lin,Zhiwei Xiong,Xinhai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Drive-R1是一种针对自动驾驶的大规模视觉语言模型，通过结合场景推理和运动规划，解决了现有模型依赖历史信息和推理与规划不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中过于依赖历史信息，且推理过程与规划结果不匹配，需要一种新方法提升规划能力。

Method: Drive-R1通过监督微调和强化学习框架，逐步从视觉输入推理到规划决策，并优化推理路径。

Result: 在nuScenes和DriveLM-nuScenes基准测试中，Drive-R1表现优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: Drive-R1为自动驾驶中推理与规划的结合提供了新方向，具有未来研究和应用的潜力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving (AD) are evolving
beyond perception and cognition tasks toward motion planning. However, we
identify two critical challenges in this direction: (1) VLMs tend to learn
shortcuts by relying heavily on history input information, achieving seemingly
strong planning results without genuinely understanding the visual inputs; and
(2) the chain-ofthought (COT) reasoning processes are always misaligned with
the motion planning outcomes, and how to effectively leverage the complex
reasoning capability to enhance planning remains largely underexplored. In this
paper, we start from a small-scale domain-specific VLM and propose Drive-R1
designed to bridges the scenario reasoning and motion planning for AD. Drive-R1
first undergoes the supervised finetuning on a elaborate dataset containing
both long and short COT data. Drive-R1 is encouraged to reason step-by-step
from visual input to final planning decisions. Subsequently, Drive-R1 is
trained within a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the
discovery of reasoning paths that are more informative for planning, guided by
rewards based on predicted trajectories and meta actions. Experimental
evaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that
Drive-R1 achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
VLMs. We believe that Drive-R1 presents a promising direction for bridging
reasoning and planning in AD, offering methodological insights for future
research and applications.

*Xiangzhao Hao,Kuan Zhu,Hongyu Guo,Haiyun Guo,Ming Tang,JinQiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出新任务REIR，结合实例级检索与定位，并构建REIRCOCO基准和基线方法CLARE，取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TIR和REC任务分别缺乏精度和可扩展性，无法满足现实场景需求。

Method: 提出REIR任务，构建REIRCOCO基准，开发CLARE方法，结合双流架构和MORE模块。

Result: CLARE在REIR上表现优异，并泛化至TIR和REC任务。

Conclusion: REIR填补了任务空白，CLARE展示了高效性和通用性。

Abstract: Natural language querying of visual content underpins many vision-language
tasks, typically categorized by text granularity and visual search scope.
Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves whole images using coarse descriptions,
while Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) localizes objects using
fine-grained expressions within a single image. However, real-world scenarios
often require both instance-level retrieval and localization across large
galleries -- tasks where TIR lacks precision and REC lacks scalability. To
address this gap, we propose a new task: Referring Expression Instance
Retrieval (REIR), which jointly supports instance-level retrieval and
localization. We introduce REIRCOCO, a large-scale benchmark constructed by
prompting vision-language models to generate fine-grained expressions for
MSCOCO and RefCOCO instances. We also present a baseline method, CLARE,
featuring a dual-stream architecture with a Mix of Relation Experts (MORE)
module for capturing inter-instance relationships. CLARE integrates object
detection and REC pretraining with Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment
(CLIA) for end-to-end optimization. Experiments show that CLARE achieves
state-of-the-art performance on REIR and generalizes well to TIR and REC,
highlighting its effectiveness and versatility.

### [180] [Semantic Structure-Aware Generative Attacks for Enhanced Adversarial Transferability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18248)
*Jongoh Jeong,Hunmin Yang,Jaeseok Jeong,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mean Teacher的语义结构感知攻击框架，通过特征蒸馏增强对抗性扰动的传递性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成对抗攻击未充分利用生成模型的语义信息，限制了扰动与目标显著区域的对齐。

Method: 利用Mean Teacher作为平滑特征参考，通过特征蒸馏指导学生与教师的早期层激活语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种模型、领域和任务中均优于现有生成攻击方法。

Conclusion: 通过锚定语义显著区域，显著提升了对抗性扰动的传递性。

Abstract: Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box
surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen
black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods
deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability;
however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the
representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic
information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode
rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain
under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with
object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To
remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on
the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With
this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the
early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich
teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the
semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on
empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on
regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct
extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate
consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks,
comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed
Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

### [181] [Improving Weakly Supervised Temporal Action Localization by Exploiting Multi-resolution Information in Temporal Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18261)
*Rui Su,Dong Xu,Luping Zhou,Wanli Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段方法，利用多分辨率信息生成高质量帧级伪标签，以解决弱监督时序动作定位问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督时序动作定位仅提供视频级标注，难以直接生成帧级标签，因此需要一种有效的方法利用有限信息。

Method: 第一阶段通过初始标签生成模块（ILG）生成可靠的帧级伪标签；第二阶段通过渐进式时序标签细化框架（PTLR）迭代优化伪标签，并利用多分辨率信息交换提升性能。

Result: 通过多分辨率信息交换和伪标签迭代优化，显著提升了时序动作定位的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过两阶段策略和多分辨率信息利用，有效解决了弱监督时序动作定位的挑战。

Abstract: Weakly supervised temporal action localization is a challenging task as only
the video-level annotation is available during the training process. To address
this problem, we propose a two-stage approach to fully exploit multi-resolution
information in the temporal domain and generate high quality frame-level pseudo
labels based on both appearance and motion streams. Specifically, in the first
stage, we generate reliable initial frame-level pseudo labels, and in the
second stage, we iteratively refine the pseudo labels and use a set of selected
frames with highly confident pseudo labels to train neural networks and better
predict action class scores at each frame. We fully exploit temporal
information at multiple scales to improve temporal action localization
performance. Specifically, in order to obtain reliable initial frame-level
pseudo labels, in the first stage, we propose an Initial Label Generation (ILG)
module, which leverages temporal multi-resolution consistency to generate high
quality class activation sequences (CASs), which consist of a number of
sequences with each sequence measuring how likely each video frame belongs to
one specific action class. In the second stage, we propose a Progressive
Temporal Label Refinement (PTLR) framework. In our PTLR framework, two networks
called Network-OTS and Network-RTS, which are respectively used to generate
CASs for the original temporal scale and the reduced temporal scales, are used
as two streams (i.e., the OTS stream and the RTS stream) to refine the pseudo
labels in turn. By this way, the multi-resolution information in the temporal
domain is exchanged at the pseudo label level, and our work can help improve
each stream (i.e., the OTS/RTS stream) by exploiting the refined pseudo labels
from another stream (i.e., the RTS/OTS stream).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种仅使用室内互联网数据（无需相机参数）实现3D语义占据预测的方法，通过自监督学习利用2D先验知识，并在两个基准测试中达到零样本SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂室内环境中，传统方法需要精确几何关系和大量标注数据，但数据采集复杂且隐私问题突出。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 收集YouTube房屋游览视频数据集YouTube-Occ，通过自监督模型利用2D先验知识（如视觉基础模型和超像素分组）训练3D占据网络。

Result: 在两个流行基准测试（NYUv2和OccScanNet）上实现了零样本SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 证明了仅用互联网数据即可实现高精度3D语义占据预测，无需相机参数或复杂标注。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction in the past was considered to require
precise geometric relationships in order to enable effective training. However,
in complex indoor environments, the large-scale and widespread collection of
data, along with the necessity for fine-grained annotations, becomes
impractical due to the complexity of data acquisition setups and privacy
concerns. In this paper, we demonstrate that 3D spatially-accurate training can
be achieved using only indoor Internet data, without the need for any
pre-knowledge of intrinsic or extrinsic camera parameters. In our framework, we
collect a web dataset, YouTube-Occ, which comprises house tour videos from
YouTube, providing abundant real house scenes for 3D representation learning.
Upon on this web dataset, we establish a fully self-supervised model to
leverage accessible 2D prior knowledge for reaching powerful 3D indoor
perception. Specifically, we harness the advantages of the prosperous vision
foundation models, distilling the 2D region-level knowledge into the occupancy
network by grouping the similar pixels into superpixels. Experimental results
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on two
popular benchmarks (NYUv2 and OccScanNet

TL;DR: ThermalLoc是一种新颖的端到端深度学习方法，专为热图像重定位设计，结合EfficientNet和Transformers提取特征，并通过MLP网络进行绝对姿态回归，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热相机通过热辐射捕捉数据，与传统可见光相机机制不同，现有视觉重定位方法不适用于热图像，因此需要专门的热相机重定位方法。

Method: ThermalLoc结合EfficientNet和Transformers提取热图像的局部和全局特征，使用两个MLP网络进行绝对姿态回归。

Result: 在公开数据集和自有数据集上，ThermalLoc在准确性和鲁棒性上优于AtLoc、MapNet、PoseNet和RobustLoc等现有方法。

Conclusion: ThermalLoc填补了热相机重定位领域的空白，展示了深度学习方法在此任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Thermal cameras capture environmental data through heat emission, a
fundamentally different mechanism compared to visible light cameras, which rely
on pinhole imaging. As a result, traditional visual relocalization methods
designed for visible light images are not directly applicable to thermal
images. Despite significant advancements in deep learning for camera
relocalization, approaches specifically tailored for thermal camera-based
relocalization remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
ThermalLoc, a novel end-to-end deep learning method for thermal image
relocalization. ThermalLoc effectively extracts both local and global features
from thermal images by integrating EfficientNet with Transformers, and performs
absolute pose regression using two MLP networks. We evaluated ThermalLoc on
both the publicly available thermal-odometry dataset and our own dataset. The
results demonstrate that ThermalLoc outperforms existing representative methods
employed for thermal camera relocalization, including AtLoc, MapNet, PoseNet,
and RobustLoc, achieving superior accuracy and robustness.

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效学习特定频率信息，显著提升MRI重建质量。

Conclusion: AMDM为未来利用掩码优化k空间数据提供了灵活框架。

Abstract: As the deep learning revolution marches on, masked modeling has emerged as a
distinctive approach that involves predicting parts of the original data that
are proportionally masked during training, and has demonstrated exceptional
performance in multiple fields. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction
is a critical task in medical imaging that seeks to recover high-quality images
from under-sampled k-space data. However, previous MRI reconstruction
strategies usually optimized the entire image domain or k-space, without
considering the importance of different frequency regions in the k-space This
work introduces a diffusion model based on adaptive masks (AMDM), which
utilizes the adaptive adjustment of frequency distribution based on k-space
data to develop a hybrid masks mechanism that adapts to different k-space
inputs. This enables the effective separation of high-frequency and
low-frequency components, producing diverse frequency-specific representations.
Additionally, the k-space frequency distribution informs the generation of
adaptive masks, which, in turn, guide a closed-loop diffusion process.
Experimental results verified the ability of this method to learn specific
frequency information and thereby improved the quality of MRI reconstruction,
providing a flexible framework for optimizing k-space data using masks in the
future.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了图像解释中的不一致性和不完整性问题，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Image explanation has been one of the key research interests in the Deep
Learning field. Throughout the years, several approaches have been adopted to
explain an input image fed by the user. From detecting an object in a given
image to explaining it in human understandable sentence, to having a
conversation describing the image, this problem has seen an immense change
throughout the years, However, the existing works have been often found to (a)
hallucinate objects that do not exist in the image and/or (b) lack identifying
the complete set of objects present in the image. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach to mitigate these drawbacks of inconsistency and incompleteness
of the objects recognized during the image explanation. To enable this, we
propose an interpretable framework that can be plugged atop diverse image
explaining frameworks including Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering
(VQA) and Prompt-based AI using LLMs, thereby enhancing their explanation
capabilities by rectifying the incorrect or missing objects. We further measure
the efficacy of the rectified explanations generated through our proposed
approaches leveraging object based precision metrics, and showcase the
improvements in the inconsistency and completeness of image explanations.
Quantitatively, the proposed framework is able to improve the explanations over
the baseline architectures of Image Captioning (improving the completeness by
81.81% and inconsistency by 37.10%), Visual Question Answering(average of 9.6%
and 37.10% in completeness and inconsistency respectively) and Prompt-based AI
model (0.01% and 5.2% for completeness and inconsistency respectively)
surpassing the current state-of-the-art by a substantial margin.

Abstract: Endoscopic image classification plays a pivotal role in medical diagnostics
by identifying anatomical landmarks and pathological findings. However,
conventional closed-set classification frameworks are inherently limited in
open-world clinical settings, where previously unseen conditions can arise
andcompromise model reliability. To address this, we explore the application of
Open Set Recognition (OSR) techniques on the Kvasir dataset, a publicly
available and diverse endoscopic image collection. In this study, we evaluate
and compare the OSR capabilities of several representative deep learning
architectures, including ResNet-50, Swin Transformer, and a hybrid
ResNet-Transformer model, under both closed-set and open-set conditions.
OpenMax is adopted as a baseline OSR method to assess the ability of these
models to distinguish known classes from previously unseen categories. This
work represents one of the first efforts to apply open set recognition to the
Kvasir dataset and provides a foundational benchmark for evaluating OSR
performance in medical image analysis. Our results offer practical insights
into model behavior in clinically realistic settings and highlight the
importance of OSR techniques for the safe deployment of AI systems in
endoscopy.

Conclusion: RP-PCN可推广至其他作物，显著提升田间群体冠层结构的分析能力。

Abstract: Quantitative descriptions of complete canopy architecture are crucial for
evaluating crop photosynthesis and yield to guide ideotype design. Although
three-dimensional (3D) sensing technologies have been developed for plant and
canopy reconstruction, severe occlusion and complex architectures hinder
accurate canopy descriptions. In this study, we propose a point cloud
completion model for 3D reconstruction of rapeseed populations from seeding to
silique stages using multi-view imaging. A complete point cloud generation
framework was developed with the virtual-real integration (VRI) simulation
method and occlusion point detection algorithm to annotate the training dataset
by distinguishing surface from occluded points. The rapeseed population point
cloud completion network (RP-PCN) was designed with a multi-resolution dynamic
graph convolutional encoder (MRDG) and point pyramid decoder (PPD) to predict
occluded points based on input surface point clouds. A dynamic graph
convolutional feature extractor (DGCFE) was introduced to capture structural
variations across the growth period. The effectiveness of point cloud
completion was validated by predicting yield using architectural indicators
from complete point clouds of rapeseed population. The results demonstrated
that RP-PCN achieved chamfer distance (CD) values of 3.35 cm, 3.46 cm, 4.32 cm,
and 4.51 cm at the seedling, bolting, flowering, and silique stages,
respectively. Ablation studies showed the effectiveness of the MRDG and DGCFE
modules, reducing CD values by 10% and 23%, respectively. The silique
efficiency index (SEI) from RP-PCN improved yield prediction accuracy by 11.2%
compared to incomplete point clouds. The RP-PCN pipeline proposed in this study
has the potential to be extended to other crops, significantly enhancing the
analysis of population canopy architectures in field environments.

Abstract: Remote sensing offers a highly effective method for obtaining accurate
information on total cropped area and crop types. The study focuses on crop
cover identification for irrigated regions of Central Punjab. Data collection
was executed in two stages: the first involved identifying and geocoding six
target crops through field surveys conducted in January and February 2023. The
second stage involved acquiring Landsat 8-9 imagery for each geocoded field to
construct a labelled dataset. The satellite imagery underwent extensive
pre-processing, including radiometric calibration for reflectance values,
atmospheric correction, and georeferencing verification to ensure consistency
within a common coordinate system. Subsequently, image fusion techniques were
applied to combine Landsat 8 and 9 spectral bands, creating a composite image
with enhanced spectral information, followed by contrast enhancement. During
data acquisition, farmers were interviewed, and fields were meticulously mapped
using GPS instruments, resulting in a comprehensive dataset of 50,835 data
points. This dataset facilitated the extraction of vegetation indices such as
NDVI, SAVO, RECI, and NDRE. These indices and raw reflectance values were
utilized for classification modeling using conventional classifiers, ensemble
learning, and artificial neural networks. A feature selection approach was also
incorporated to identify the optimal feature set for classification learning.
This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining remote sensing data and
advanced modeling techniques to improve crop classification accuracy in
irrigated agricultural regions.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多模态大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中虚假相关性的问题，开发了SpuriVerse基准测试，评估了15种模型，发现即使最先进的闭源模型表现也较差，但通过微调可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究虚假相关性在多模态LVLM中的影响，尤其是在真实世界任务中，而非人为设计的狭窄任务。

Method: 通过GPT-4o的错误数据构建SpuriVerse基准，包含124种虚假相关性类型，共1364个多选题，评估15种LVLM的性能。

Result: 最先进的闭源模型准确率仅为37.1%，但通过微调提升至78.40%，表明模型能学会避免“捷径”并关注整体图像上下文。

Conclusion: SpuriVerse为研究虚假相关性提供了新工具，微调能显著提升模型性能，表明模型能学习更通用的模式。

Abstract: Finetuning can cause spurious correlations to arise between non-essential
features and the target labels, but benchmarks to study these effects involve
contrived settings and narrow tasks. In contrast, we consider spurious
correlations in multi-modal Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) pretrained on
extensive and diverse datasets without explicit task supervision. We develop a
benchmark by sourcing GPT-4o errors on real-world visual-question-answering
(VQA) benchmarks, then curating a subset through LVLM-human annotation and
synthetic counterfactual evaluation to identify errors caused by spurious
correlations. This process yields SpuriVerse, a novel benchmark comprised of
124 distinct types of spurious correlations extracted from real-world datasets,
each containing 1 realistic and 10 synthetic VQA samples for a total of 1364
multiple choice questions. We evaluate 15 open and closed-source LVLMs on
SpuriVerse, finding that even state-of-the-art closed-source models struggle
significantly, achieving at best only 37.1% accuracy. Fine-tuning on synthetic
examples that emphasize the spurious correlation improves performance to
78.40%, suggesting that training on diverse spurious patterns generalizes to
unseen situations: models appear to learn to avoid "shortcuts" and attend to
the overall image context.

Conclusion: LucentVisionNet适用于移动摄影、监控和自主导航等实际应用，具有广泛部署潜力。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in the
absence of paired training data. In this study, we present LucentVisionNet, a
novel zero-shot learning framework that addresses the limitations of
traditional and deep learning-based enhancement methods. The proposed approach
integrates multi-scale spatial attention with a deep curve estimation network,
enabling fine-grained enhancement while preserving semantic and perceptual
fidelity. To further improve generalization, we adopt a recurrent enhancement
strategy and optimize the model using a composite loss function comprising six
tailored components, including a novel no-reference image quality loss inspired
by human visual perception. Extensive experiments on both paired and unpaired
benchmark datasets demonstrate that LucentVisionNet consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art supervised, unsupervised, and zero-shot methods across
multiple full-reference and no-reference image quality metrics. Our framework
achieves high visual quality, structural consistency, and computational
efficiency, making it well-suited for deployment in real-world applications
such as mobile photography, surveillance, and autonomous navigation.

*Yu Xie,Chengjie Zeng,Lingyun Zhang,Yanwei Fu*

TL;DR: 本文提出PromptSan方法，通过NSFW分类器引导的提示净化技术，减少文本到图像模型生成有害内容的风险，同时保持生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像模型的快速发展，其生成有害内容的风险增加，阻碍了技术的可持续发展。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出PromptSan方法，包含PromptSan-Modify（迭代替换有害标记）和PromptSan-Suffix（训练优化后缀序列）两种变体。

Result: 实验表明，PromptSan在减少有害内容生成方面表现优异，平衡了安全性和可用性。

Conclusion: PromptSan是一种有效的提示净化方法，为文本到图像模型的伦理使用提供了解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable
Diffusion, has enhanced their capability to synthesize images from textual
prompts. However, this progress also raises significant risks of misuse,
including the generation of harmful content (e.g., pornography, violence,
discrimination), which contradicts the ethical goals of T2I technology and
hinders its sustainable development. Inspired by "jailbreak" attacks in large
language models, which bypass restrictions through subtle prompt modifications,
this paper proposes NSFW-Classifier Guided Prompt Sanitization (PromptSan), a
novel approach to detoxify harmful prompts without altering model architecture
or degrading generation capability. PromptSan includes two variants:
PromptSan-Modify, which iteratively identifies and replaces harmful tokens in
input prompts using text NSFW classifiers during inference, and
PromptSan-Suffix, which trains an optimized suffix token sequence to neutralize
harmful intent while passing both text and image NSFW classifier checks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PromptSan achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reducing harmful content generation across multiple metrics,
effectively balancing safety and usability.

Motivation: 现有3D生成模型生成的内容可能不符合人类主观偏好或任务需求，且依赖2D文本到图像模型，缺乏对3D结构的理解。

Method: 提出了一种端到端可微分偏好学习框架，通过几何感知的奖励函数反向传播人类偏好，优化3D生成流程。

Result: 通过四种几何感知奖励函数验证了框架的有效性，实现了更可控和可解释的高质量3D内容生成。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于自然语言的高质量3D内容生成提供了更可控和几何感知的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generative models have achieved impressive results but
3D contents generated by these models may not align with subjective human
preferences or task-specific criteria. Moreover, a core challenge in the 3D
texture generation domain remains: most existing approaches rely on repeated
calls to 2D text-to-image generative models, which lack an inherent
understanding of the 3D structure of the input 3D mesh object. To address this,
we propose an end-to-end differentiable preference learning framework that
back-propagates human preferences, represented by differentiable reward
functions, through the entire 3D generative pipeline, making the process
inherently geometry-aware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
using four proposed novel geometry-aware reward functions, offering a more
controllable and interpretable pathway for high-quality 3D content creation
from natural language.

Conclusion: 该方法通过改进特征整合和解码器设计，显著提升了医学图像分割的准确性。

Abstract: Segmenting biomarkers in medical images is crucial for various biotech
applications. Despite advances, Transformer and CNN based methods often
struggle with variations in staining and morphology, limiting feature
extraction. In medical image segmentation, where datasets often have limited
sample availability, recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods achieve higher
accuracy by leveraging pre-trained encoders, whereas end-to-end methods tend to
underperform. This is due to challenges in effectively transferring rich
multiscale features from encoders to decoders, as well as limitations in
decoder efficiency. To address these issues, we propose an architecture that
captures multi-scale local and global contextual information and a novel
decoder design, which effectively integrates features from the encoder,
emphasizes important channels and regions, and reconstructs spatial dimensions
to enhance segmentation accuracy. Our method, compatible with various encoders,
outperforms SOTA methods, as demonstrated by experiments on four datasets and
ablation studies. Specifically, our method achieves absolute performance gains
of 2.76% on MoNuSeg, 3.12% on DSB, 2.87% on Electron Microscopy, and 4.03% on
TNBC datasets compared to existing SOTA methods. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BSMamba是一种新颖的视觉Mamba架构，通过亮度Mamba和语义Mamba组件，解决了低光图像增强中亮度恢复和语义一致性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低光图像增强方法在提升亮度时难以同时保持语义一致性和细节，且现有视觉Mamba方法因固定扫描规则限制了长距离依赖的捕捉。

Method: BSMamba包含亮度Mamba和语义Mamba，分别基于亮度和语义相似性建模令牌交互，避免固定扫描模式的限制。

Result: 实验表明，BSMamba在低光图像增强任务中实现了最先进的性能，同时保持了语义一致性。

Conclusion: BSMamba通过亮度与语义引导的令牌交互，显著提升了低光图像增强的效果和效率。

Abstract: Current low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods face significant
limitations in simultaneously improving brightness while preserving semantic
consistency, fine details, and computational efficiency. With the emergence of
state-space models, particularly Mamba, image restoration has achieved
remarkable performance, yet existing visual Mamba approaches flatten 2D images
into 1D token sequences using fixed scanning rules, critically limiting
interactions between distant tokens with causal relationships and constraining
their ability to capture meaningful long-range dependencies. To address these
fundamental limitations, we propose BSMamba, a novel visual Mamba architecture
comprising two specially designed components: Brightness Mamba and Semantic
Mamba. The Brightness Mamba revolutionizes token interaction patterns by
prioritizing connections between distant tokens with similar brightness levels,
effectively addressing the challenge of brightness restoration in LLIE tasks
through brightness-guided selective attention. Complementing this, the Semantic
Mamba establishes priority interactions between tokens sharing similar semantic
meanings, allowing the model to maintain contextual consistency by connecting
semantically related regions across the image, thus preserving the hierarchical
nature of image semantics during enhancement. By intelligently modeling tokens
based on brightness and semantic similarity rather than arbitrary scanning
patterns, BSMamba transcends the constraints of conventional token sequencing
while adhering to the principles of causal modeling. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLIE while
preserving semantic consistency.

Method: 通过创新的数据预处理方法，结合频域和空间域信息，提升图像特征表示准确性。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效提升分类性能。

Conclusion: 结合频域信息的SFIFNet在小样本学习中表现优越。

Abstract: The objective of Few-shot learning is to fully leverage the limited data
resources for exploring the latent correlations within the data by applying
algorithms and training a model with outstanding performance that can
adequately meet the demands of practical applications. In practical
applications, the number of images in each category is usually less than that
in traditional deep learning, which can lead to over-fitting and poor
generalization performance. Currently, many Few-shot classification models pay
more attention to spatial domain information while neglecting frequency domain
information, which contains more feature information. Ignoring frequency domain
information will prevent the model from fully exploiting feature information,
which would effect the classification performance. Based on conventional data
augmentation, this paper proposes an SFIFNet with innovative data
preprocessing. The key of this method is enhancing the accuracy of image
feature representation by integrating frequency domain information with spatial
domain information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
this method in enhancing classification performance.

TL;DR: SeeKer是一种基于自回归因子化的方法，用于检测人体骨骼序列中的异常行为，通过关键点级别的条件分布建模，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗监控、工作场所安全和公共监控等安全关键应用中，检测异常行为至关重要。异常通常表现为不寻常的人体姿态。

Method: 通过自回归因子化在关键点级别建模骨骼序列密度，利用条件高斯分布预测关键点位置，并通过低密度标记异常。

Result: 在UBnormal、MSAD-HR数据集上表现最佳，在ShanghaiTech数据集上也有竞争力。

Conclusion: SeeKer方法简单有效，显著提升了异常行为检测的性能。

Abstract: Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in
safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety,
or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected
with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting
anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton
sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level.
The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint
locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of
the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across
its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint
locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our
anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the
weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite
its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the
UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the
ShanghaiTech dataset.

Result: 该方法显著提升了模型的视觉识别和个性化生成能力，在多概念图像描述任务中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 强化学习框架为多模态大语言模型的个性化图像描述提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to generate
personalized image captions, even when trained on high-quality captions. In
this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing
post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being
post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT),
these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world
scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring
large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and
difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for
personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual
recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently
outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging
multi-concept image captioning task.

Abstract: Recent benchmarks and datasets have been proposed to improve spatial

limited in scale, visual diversity, and instruction expressiveness. In this
work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial
reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation
benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction
formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view
and multi-view settings, drawn from diverse visual environments and supporting
19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we
propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view
reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not
been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on
InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on
VSI-Bench, while maintaining strong performance on general-purpose benchmarks.
We hope these resources will support the development of spatially capable VLMs
in practical applications such as robotics and embodied AI.

Motivation: 解决分布式多目标滤波中PMB密度GCI融合的复杂性问题，提出一种可行的近似方法。

Method: 提出一种近似方法，将PMB密度的幂近似为未归一化的PMB密度，并通过GCI融合规则实现归一化乘积，结果表示为闭式泊松多伯努利混合（PMBM）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于其他分布式多目标滤波器。

Conclusion: 该方法通过近似和闭式表达，有效解决了分布式多目标滤波中的融合问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper presents the distributed Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter
based on the generalised covariance intersection (GCI) fusion rule for
distributed multi-object filtering. Since the exact GCI fusion of two PMB
densities is intractable, we derive a principled approximation. Specifically,
we approximate the power of a PMB density as an unnormalised PMB density, which
corresponds to an upper bound of the PMB density. Then, the GCI fusion rule
corresponds to the normalised product of two unnormalised PMB densities. We
show that the result is a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM), which can be
expressed in closed form. Future prediction and update steps in each filter
preserve the PMBM form, which can be projected back to a PMB density before the
next fusion step. Experimental results show the benefits of this approach
compared to other distributed multi-object filters.

Abstract: Melanoma represents a critical health risk due to its aggressive progression
and high mortality, underscoring the need for early, interpretable diagnostic
tools. While deep learning has advanced in skin lesion classification, most
existing models provide only binary outputs, offering limited clinical insight.
This work introduces a novel approach that extends beyond classification,
enabling interpretable risk modelling through a Conditional Variational
Autoencoder. The proposed method learns a structured latent space that captures
semantic relationships among lesions, allowing for a nuanced, continuous
assessment of morphological differences. An SVM is also trained on this
representation effectively differentiating between benign nevi and melanomas,
demonstrating strong and consistent performance. More importantly, the learned
latent space supports visual and geometric interpretation of malignancy, with
the spatial proximity of a lesion to known melanomas serving as a meaningful
indicator of risk. This approach bridges predictive performance with clinical
applicability, fostering early detection, highlighting ambiguous cases, and
enhancing trust in AI-assisted diagnosis through transparent and interpretable
decision-making.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for improving
prognosis prediction in medical imaging, yet its effective application remains
challenging. In this work, we introduce a structured benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate and compare the transferability of Convolutional Neural
Networks and Foundation Models in predicting clinical outcomes in COVID-19
patients, leveraging diverse publicly available Chest X-ray datasets. Our
experimental methodology extensively explores a wide set of fine-tuning
strategies, encompassing traditional approaches such as Full Fine-Tuning and
Linear Probing, as well as advanced Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods
including Low-Rank Adaptation, BitFit, VeRA, and IA3. The evaluations were
conducted across multiple learning paradigms, including both extensive
full-data scenarios and more clinically realistic Few-Shot Learning settings,
which are critical for modeling rare disease outcomes and rapidly emerging
health threats. By implementing a large-scale comparative analysis involving a
diverse selection of pretrained models, including general-purpose architectures
pretrained on large-scale datasets such as CLIP and DINOv2, to
biomedical-specific models like MedCLIP, BioMedCLIP, and PubMedCLIP, we
rigorously assess each model's capacity to effectively adapt and generalize to
prognosis tasks, particularly under conditions of severe data scarcity and
pronounced class imbalance. The benchmark was designed to capture critical
conditions common in prognosis tasks, including variations in dataset size and
class distribution, providing detailed insights into the strengths and
limitations of each fine-tuning strategy. This extensive and structured
evaluation aims to inform the practical deployment and adoption of robust,
efficient, and generalizable AI-driven solutions in real-world clinical
prognosis prediction workflows.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效保留更多高频信息，提升图像修复质量。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过频域融合和新型注意力机制，解决了Transformer在图像修复中的高频细节丢失和计算成本问题。

Abstract: Image inpainting plays a vital role in restoring missing image regions and
supporting high-level vision tasks, but traditional methods struggle with
complex textures and large occlusions. Although Transformer-based approaches
have demonstrated strong global modeling capabilities, they often fail to
preserve high-frequency details due to the low-pass nature of self-attention
and suffer from high computational costs. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a Transformer-based image inpainting method incorporating
frequency-domain fusion. Specifically, an attention mechanism combining wavelet
transform and Gabor filtering is introduced to enhance multi-scale structural
modeling and detail preservation. Additionally, a learnable frequency-domain
filter based on the fast Fourier transform is designed to replace the
feedforward network, enabling adaptive noise suppression and detail retention.
The model adopts a four-level encoder-decoder structure and is guided by a
novel loss strategy to balance global semantics and fine details. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the quality
of image inpainting by preserving more high-frequency information.

Abstract: Editing natural images using textual descriptions in text-to-image diffusion
models remains a significant challenge, particularly in achieving consistent
generation and handling complex, non-rigid objects. Existing methods often
struggle to preserve textures and identity, require extensive fine-tuning, and
exhibit limitations in editing specific spatial regions or objects while
retaining background details. This paper proposes Context-Preserving Adaptive
Manipulation (CPAM), a novel zero-shot framework for complicated, non-rigid
real image editing. Specifically, we propose a preservation adaptation module
that adjusts self-attention mechanisms to preserve and independently control
the object and background effectively. This ensures that the objects' shapes,
textures, and identities are maintained while keeping the background
undistorted during the editing process using the mask guidance technique.
Additionally, we develop a localized extraction module to mitigate the
interference with the non-desired modified regions during conditioning in
cross-attention mechanisms. We also introduce various mask-guidance strategies
to facilitate diverse image manipulation tasks in a simple manner. Extensive
experiments on our newly constructed Image Manipulation BenchmArk (IMBA), a
robust benchmark dataset specifically designed for real image editing,
demonstrate that our proposed method is the preferred choice among human
raters, outperforming existing state-of-the-art editing techniques.

Result: DIP在多种下游任务中表现优异，优于初始编码器和现有方法，计算效率高（单A100 GPU耗时<9小时）。

Conclusion: DIP为提升密集表示提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce DIP, a novel unsupervised post-training method designed to
enhance dense image representations in large-scale pretrained vision encoders
for in-context scene understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely on
complex self-distillation architectures, our method trains the vision encoder
using pseudo-tasks that explicitly simulate downstream in-context scenarios,
inspired by meta-learning principles. To enable post-training on unlabeled
data, we propose an automatic mechanism for generating in-context tasks that
combines a pretrained diffusion model and the vision encoder itself. DIP is
simple, unsupervised, and computationally efficient, requiring less than 9
hours on a single A100 GPU. By learning dense representations through pseudo
in-context tasks, it achieves strong performance across a wide variety of
downstream real-world in-context scene understanding tasks. It outperforms both
the initial vision encoder and prior methods, offering a practical and

Conclusion: AViLA为流数据交互提供了一种有效解决方案，适用于自动驾驶等实时应用。

Abstract: An ideal vision-language agent serves as a bridge between the human users and
their surrounding physical world in real-world applications like autonomous
driving and embodied agents, and proactively provides accurate and timely
responses given user intents. An intriguing challenge arises when agents
interact with the world as a dynamic data stream and ad-hoc queries from users:
supporting knowledge for queries, namely evidence, usually appears
asynchronously with the arrival time of queries, and agents need to ground
their responses in historical data, present observations, and even future
streams. We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user
queries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the
streaming setting. This setting requires not only strong reasoning capabilities
but also the ability to retain past observations and respond to queries with
temporal awareness. In this paper, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark that
evaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to handle
interaction with streaming data. Further, we present AViLA, Asynchronous
Video-Language Agent for streaming data interaction that can handle ad-hoc
queries and give time-aware responses. For this purpose, AViLA consists of
three key modules: comprehensive memory retention, evidence identification, and
evidence-grounded trigger, that are designed to maintain a general-purpose
memory and respond readily and timely to queries. Our experiments show that
existing models often fail to respond at appropriate times, while AViLA
significantly improves both accuracy and temporal awareness. Our code and
dataset will be publicly available.

Result: 在多个任务基准测试中表现优异，尤其在上下文生成任务中达到开源模型的最先进水平。

Conclusion: OmniGen2是一个高效且多功能的开源生成模型，为未来研究提供了丰富的资源和工具。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative
model designed to provide a unified solution for diverse generation tasks,
including text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike
OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image
modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This
design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models
without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text
generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed
comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and
in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism
tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset
based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2
achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including
text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation,
also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named
OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
models in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code,
datasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this
field. Project Page: https://vectorspacelab.github.io/OmniGen2; GitHub Link:

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的上下文一致性学习（CCL）框架，通过结合一致性正则化和伪标签技术，提升半监督视频段落定位（SSVPG）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了通过扰动查询上下文生成强监督信号的重要性，导致性能受限。

Method: 采用教师-学生学习和伪标签重训练，利用强增强样本和预测一致性作为标签置信度。

Result: 实验表明CCL显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CCL框架有效提升了半监督视频段落定位的性能。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Video Paragraph Grounding (SSVPG) aims to localize multiple
sentences in a paragraph from an untrimmed video with limited temporal
annotations. Existing methods focus on teacher-student consistency learning and
video-level contrastive loss, but they overlook the importance of perturbing
query contexts to generate strong supervisory signals. In this work, we propose
a novel Context Consistency Learning (CCL) framework that unifies the paradigms
of consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to enhance semi-supervised
learning. Specifically, we first conduct teacher-student learning where the
student model takes as inputs strongly-augmented samples with sentences removed
and is enforced to learn from the adequately strong supervisory signals from
the teacher model. Afterward, we conduct model retraining based on the
generated pseudo labels, where the mutual agreement between the original and
augmented views' predictions is utilized as the label confidence. Extensive
experiments show that CCL outperforms existing methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态框架，通过共享的离散语义表示统一视觉理解和生成，核心是文本对齐的Tokenizer（TA-Tok）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过统一的表示空间整合视觉和文本模态，避免模态特定设计，提升跨模态输入和输出的效率。

Method: 使用TA-Tok将图像转换为离散标记，结合尺度自适应编码解码和生成式去标记器，支持两种互补的去标记器（自回归和扩散模型）。

Result: 实验表明，Tar在多模态LLM任务中表现优异，收敛更快且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了视觉与文本的统一表示，为多模态任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a multimodal framework that attempts to unify visual
understanding and generation within a shared discrete semantic representation.
At its core is the Text-Aligned Tokenizer (TA-Tok), which converts images into
discrete tokens using a text-aligned codebook projected from a large language
model's (LLM) vocabulary. By integrating vision and text into a unified space
with an expanded vocabulary, our multimodal LLM, Tar, enables cross-modal input
and output through a shared interface, without the need for modality-specific
designs. Additionally, we propose scale-adaptive encoding and decoding to
balance efficiency and visual detail, along with a generative de-tokenizer to
produce high-fidelity visual outputs. To address diverse decoding needs, we
utilize two complementary de-tokenizers: a fast autoregressive model and a
diffusion-based model. To enhance modality fusion, we investigate advanced
pre-training tasks, demonstrating improvements in both visual understanding and
generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Tar matches or surpasses
existing multimodal LLM methods, achieving faster convergence and greater
training efficiency. Code, models, and data are available at

Motivation: 解决H&E-HER2染色转换任务中缺乏公开数据集和模型性能不明确的问题。

Method: 引入HER2match数据集，比较多种GANs和DMs，并提出一种新颖的Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model（BBDM）。

Result: GANs整体优于DMs，BBDM表现接近；数据对齐显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 研究提供了高质量数据集和模型性能比较，为相关研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Virtual staining is a promising technique that uses deep generative models to
recreate histological stains, providing a faster and more cost-effective
alternative to traditional tissue chemical staining. Specifically for H&E-HER2
staining transfer, despite a rising trend in publications, the lack of
sufficient public datasets has hindered progress in the topic. Additionally, it
is currently unclear which model frameworks perform best for this particular
task. In this paper, we introduce the HER2match dataset, the first publicly
available dataset with the same breast cancer tissue sections stained with both
H&E and HER2. Furthermore, we compare the performance of several Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), and implement a novel
Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model for H&E-HER2 translation. Our findings indicate
that, overall, GANs perform better than DMs, with only the BBDM achieving
comparable results. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of data alignment,
as all models trained on HER2match produced vastly improved visuals compared to
the widely used consecutive-slide BCI dataset. This research provides a new
high-quality dataset ([available upon publication acceptance]), improving both
model training and evaluation. In addition, our comparison of frameworks offers
valuable guidance for researchers working on the topic.

Result: 实验和用户研究验证了ShowFlow的有效性。

Conclusion: ShowFlow在广告和虚拟试衣等实际应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Customizing image generation remains a core challenge in controllable image
synthesis. For single-concept generation, maintaining both identity
preservation and prompt alignment is challenging. In multi-concept scenarios,
relying solely on a prompt without additional conditions like layout boxes or
semantic masks, often leads to identity loss and concept omission. In this
paper, we introduce ShowFlow, a comprehensive framework designed to tackle
these challenges. We propose ShowFlow-S for single-concept image generation,
and ShowFlow-M for handling multiple concepts. ShowFlow-S introduces a
KronA-WED adapter, which integrates a Kronecker adapter with weight and
embedding decomposition, and employs a disentangled learning approach with a
novel attention regularization objective to enhance single-concept generation.
Building on this foundation, ShowFlow-M directly reuses the learned models from
ShowFlow-S to support multi-concept generation without extra conditions,
incorporating a Subject-Adaptive Matching Attention (SAMA) and a layout
consistency strategy as the plug-and-play module. Extensive experiments and
user studies validate ShowFlow's effectiveness, highlighting its potential in
real-world applications like advertising and virtual dressing.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对长尾数据分布的知识蒸馏框架LTKD，通过分解标准KD目标为组间和组内KL散度，并引入重新平衡的损失函数，显著提升了模型在尾类上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏在长尾数据分布中表现不佳，因为教师模型对头部类别有偏见，导致对尾类别的监督不足。

Method: 将标准KD目标分解为组间和组内KL散度，并设计重新平衡的组间损失和均匀的组内损失。

Result: 在多个数据集上，LTKD在整体准确率和尾类性能上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LTKD能够有效从有偏见的教师模型中转移知识，适用于资源受限和不平衡的实际场景。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a widely adopted model compression technique
where a compact student model learns from the output of a larger, pre-trained
teacher. While effective in balanced settings, conventional KD suffers
significantly when applied to long-tailed data distributions, as the teacher
model tends to be biased toward head classes and provides limited supervision
for tail classes. In this paper, we propose Long-Tailed Knowledge Distillation
(LTKD), a novel framework tailored for class-imbalanced scenarios. We begin by
reformulating the standard KD objective into two components: inter-group and
intra-group Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, corresponding to the prediction
distributions across and within class groups (head, medium, tail),
respectively. This decomposition allows us to identify and quantify the sources
of teacher bias. To address them, we introduce (1) a rebalanced inter-group
loss that calibrates the teacher's group-level predictions and (2) a uniform
intra-group loss that ensures equal contribution from all groups during
distillation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100-LT, TinyImageNet-LT, and
ImageNet-LT show that LTKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods,
achieving significant gains in both overall accuracy and tail-class
performance. Our results demonstrate that LTKD enables effective knowledge
transfer even from biased teachers, making it a strong candidate for real-world
deployment in resource-constrained and imbalanced settings.

Abstract: Recently, vision-language pretraining has emerged as a transformative
technique that integrates the strengths of both visual and textual modalities,
resulting in powerful vision-language models (VLMs). Leveraging web-scale
pretraining data, these models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities. However,
their performance often deteriorates when confronted with domain-specific or
specialized generalization tasks. To address this, a growing body of research
focuses on transferring or generalizing the rich knowledge embedded in VLMs to
various downstream applications. This survey aims to comprehensively summarize
the generalization settings, methodologies, benchmarking and results in VLM
literatures. Delving into the typical VLM structures, current literatures are
categorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods
according to the transferred modules. The differences and characteristics in
each category are furthered summarized and discussed by revisiting the typical
transfer learning (TL) settings, providing novel interpretations for TL in the
era of VLMs. Popular benchmarks for VLM generalization are further introduced
with thorough performance comparisons among the reviewed methods. Following the
advances in large-scale generalizable pretraining, this survey also discusses
the relations and differences between VLMs and up-to-date multimodal large
language models (MLLM), e.g., DeepSeek-VL. By systematically reviewing the
surging literatures in vision-language research from a novel and practical
generalization prospective, this survey contributes to a clear landscape of
current and future multimodal researches.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable multi-disease diagnosis remains a critical
challenge in medical research, particularly when leveraging heterogeneous
multimodal medical data. Current approaches often rely on single-modal data,
limiting their ability to comprehensively understand complex diseases. To
address this, we propose MedTVT-R1, a novel Multimodal Large Language Model

dataset that provides question-answer pairs for physiological-level
interpretations and disease-level diagnoses with a Chain of Evidence approach.
MedTVT-R1 incorporates a modality perception layer to capture inter-modal
dependencies and adaptively weight modality contributions. Additionally, we
employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning with a Jaccard Reward function to enhance diagnostic reasoning.
Experimental results demonstrate MedTVT-R1's superiority in multimodal feature
utilization and multi-disease diagnosis, offering significant potential for
clinical applications such as diagnostic report generation and comorbidity

Result: TEAFormer在多种图像修复任务中表现出色，具有高效性、训练收敛快和泛化能力强等优势。

Conclusion: TEAFormer通过自适应滑动索引机制有效解决了翻译等变性问题，为图像修复任务提供了高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Translation equivariance is a fundamental inductive bias in image
restoration, ensuring that translated inputs produce translated outputs.
Attention mechanisms in modern restoration transformers undermine this
property, adversely impacting both training convergence and generalization. To
alleviate this issue, we propose two key strategies for incorporating
translation equivariance: slide indexing and component stacking. Slide indexing
maintains operator responses at fixed positions, with sliding window attention
being a notable example, while component stacking enables the arrangement of
translation-equivariant operators in parallel or sequentially, thereby building
complex architectures while preserving translation equivariance. However, these
strategies still create a dilemma in model design between the high
computational cost of self-attention and the fixed receptive field associated
with sliding window attention. To address this, we develop an adaptive sliding
indexing mechanism to efficiently select key-value pairs for each query, which
are then concatenated in parallel with globally aggregated key-value pairs. The
designed network, called the Translation Equivariance Adaptive Transformer
(TEAFormer), is assessed across a variety of image restoration tasks. The
results highlight its superiority in terms of effectiveness, training
convergence, and generalization.

Abstract: Generating multi-view images from human instructions is crucial for 3D
content creation. The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across
multiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse
conditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (MV-AR)
method, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate
consistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the
next-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its
effectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis. When generating
widely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding views to extract
effective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a unified model that
accommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training
strategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection
modules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal
conditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This
strategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as a baseline to
enhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through
the randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to alleviate the
overfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we propose the
"Shuffle View" data augmentation technique, thus significantly expanding the
training data by several magnitudes. Experiments demonstrate the performance
and versatility of our MV-AR, which consistently generates consistent
multi-view images across a range of conditions and performs on par with leading
diffusion-based multi-view image generation models. Code and models will be

Conclusion: HS2SD能更细致地建模双曲集合间的层次和复杂关系。

Abstract: We propose a hyperbolic set-to-set distance measure for computing
dissimilarity between sets in hyperbolic space. While point-to-point distances
in hyperbolic space effectively capture hierarchical relationships between data
points, many real-world applications require comparing sets of hyperbolic data
points, where the local structure and the global structure of the sets carry
crucial semantic information. The proposed the \underline{h}yperbolic
\underline{s}et-\underline{to}-\underline{s}et \underline{d}istance measure
(HS2SD) integrates both global and local structural information: global
structure through geodesic distances between Einstein midpoints of hyperbolic
sets, and local structure through topological characteristics of the two sets.
To efficiently compute topological differences, we prove that using a finite
Thue-Morse sequence of degree and adjacency matrices can serve as a robust
approximation to capture the topological structure of a set. In this case, by
considering the topological differences, HS2SD provides a more nuanced
understanding of the relationships between two hyperbolic sets. Empirical
evaluation on entity matching, standard image classification, and few-shot
image classification demonstrates that our distance measure outperforms
existing methods by effectively modeling the hierarchical and complex
relationships inherent in hyperbolic sets.

Abstract: Learning in hyperbolic spaces has attracted increasing attention due to its
superior ability to model hierarchical structures of data. Most existing
hyperbolic learning methods use fixed distance measures for all data, assuming
a uniform hierarchy across all data points. However, real-world hierarchical
structures exhibit significant diversity, making this assumption overly
restrictive. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware distance measure in
hyperbolic spaces, which dynamically adapts to varying hierarchical structures.
Our approach derives the distance measure by generating tailored projections
and curvatures for each pair of data points, effectively mapping them to an
appropriate hyperbolic space. We introduce a revised low-rank decomposition
scheme and a hard-pair mining mechanism to mitigate the computational cost of
pair-wise distance computation without compromising accuracy. We present an
upper bound on the low-rank approximation error using Talagrand's concentration
inequality, ensuring theoretical robustness. Extensive experiments on standard
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), hierarchical
classification (5-level CIFAR-100), and few-shot learning tasks (mini-ImageNet,
tiered-ImageNet) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach
consistently outperforms learning methods that use fixed distance measures,
with notable improvements on few-shot learning tasks, where it achieves over
5\% gains on mini-ImageNet. The results reveal that adaptive distance measures
better capture diverse hierarchical structures, with visualization showing
clearer class boundaries and improved prototype separation in hyperbolic
spaces.

Abstract: Recently, detecting logical anomalies is becoming a more challenging task
compared to detecting structural ones. Existing encoder decoder based methods
typically compress inputs into low-dimensional bottlenecks on the assumption
that the compression process can effectively suppress the transmission of
logical anomalies to the decoder. However, logical anomalies present a
particular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal
semantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns.
Thanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these
abnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks.
This ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with
misleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel
normality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly
detection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder
directly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the
reconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics
of normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable
semantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of
normal samples by vector quantisation. Finally, the above multi-semantic
features are fused and employed as input to the decoder to guide the
reconstruction of anomalies to approximate normality. Extensive experiments are
conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and it achieves
the SOTA performance on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset with improvements of 5.7% in
pixel-sPRO and 2.6% in image-AUROC. The source code is available at

*Sung Jin Um,Dongjin Kim,Sangmin Lee,Jung Uk Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的声源定位框架，通过生成细粒度语义信息区分发声物体与静默物体，并引入两种新型损失函数（OCA和ORI），显著提升了复杂场景中的定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景中难以准确定位发声物体，尤其是当存在视觉相似的静默物体时，主要原因是其依赖简单的视听对应关系，未能捕捉细粒度语义差异。

Method: 利用MLLMs生成详细上下文信息，明确区分发声前景物体与静默背景物体，并设计了两种新型损失函数（OCA和ORI）以有效整合信息。

Result: 在MUSIC和VGG-Sound数据集上的实验表明，该方法在单源和多源定位场景中均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过细粒度语义区分和新型损失函数，有效解决了复杂场景中的声源定位问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Audio-visual sound source localization task aims to spatially localize
sound-making objects within visual scenes by integrating visual and audio cues.
However, existing methods struggle with accurately localizing sound-making
objects in complex scenes, particularly when visually similar silent objects
coexist. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on simple
audio-visual correspondence, which does not capture fine-grained semantic
differences between sound-making and silent objects. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel sound source localization framework leveraging
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate detailed contextual
information that explicitly distinguishes between sound-making foreground
objects and silent background objects. To effectively integrate this detailed
information, we introduce two novel loss functions: Object-aware Contrastive
Alignment (OCA) loss and Object Region Isolation (ORI) loss. Extensive
experimental results on MUSIC and VGGSound datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, significantly outperforming existing methods in
both single-source and multi-source localization scenarios. Code and generated
detailed contextual information are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQ-Insight是一种新型推理式视觉语言模型框架，用于评估AI生成视频的质量，通过渐进式学习方案和多维度评分奖励，显著提升了视频生成任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成视频质量评估方法存在泛化能力有限、缺乏时间感知、依赖大规模标注数据等问题，需要更有效的评估框架。

Method: 提出VQ-Insight框架，结合图像质量预热、任务特定时间学习和与视频生成模型的联合优化，设计多维度评分和偏好比较奖励。

Result: 实验表明VQ-Insight在偏好比较、多维度评分和自然视频评分上优于现有方法，显著提升视频生成任务性能。

Conclusion: VQ-Insight通过创新设计和优化，解决了当前视频质量评估的局限性，为AI生成视频提供了更有效的评估工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have led to the emergence of
powerful text-to-video generation models. Despite these successes, evaluating
the quality of AIGC-generated videos remains challenging due to limited
generalization, lack of temporal awareness, heavy reliance on large-scale
annotated datasets, and the lack of effective interaction with generation
models. Most current approaches rely on supervised finetuning of
vision-language models (VLMs), which often require large-scale annotated
datasets and tend to decouple understanding and generation. To address these
shortcomings, we propose VQ-Insight, a novel reasoning-style VLM framework for
AIGC video quality assessment. Our approach features: (1) a progressive video
quality learning scheme that combines image quality warm-up, general
task-specific temporal learning, and joint optimization with the video
generation model; (2) the design of multi-dimension scoring rewards, preference
comparison rewards, and temporal modeling rewards to enhance both
generalization and specialization in video quality evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VQ-Insight consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in preference comparison, multi-dimension scoring,
and natural video scoring, bringing significant improvements for video
generation tasks.

*Oleh Kuzyk,Zuoyue Li,Marc Pollefeys,Xi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualChef是一种为烹饪场景生成上下文视觉辅助的方法，通过基于掩码的视觉定位简化对齐，无需额外标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 烹饪过程中缺乏一致的视觉指导，现有方法依赖复杂文本描述和标注，VisualChef旨在简化这一过程。

Method: 利用掩码视觉定位识别动作相关对象并分类，生成反映动作和结果的图像，同时保持环境一致。

Result: 在三个第一人称视频数据集上定量和定性评估显示，VisualChef优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VisualChef通过简化视觉-文本对齐，为烹饪提供更高效的视觉辅助。

Abstract: Cooking requires not only following instructions but also understanding,
executing, and monitoring each step - a process that can be challenging without
visual guidance. Although recipe images and videos offer helpful cues, they
often lack consistency in focus, tools, and setup. To better support the
cooking process, we introduce VisualChef, a method for generating contextual
visual aids tailored to cooking scenarios. Given an initial frame and a
specified action, VisualChef generates images depicting both the action's
execution and the resulting appearance of the object, while preserving the
initial frame's environment. Previous work aims to integrate knowledge
extracted from large language models by generating detailed textual
descriptions to guide image generation, which requires fine-grained
visual-textual alignment and involves additional annotations. In contrast,
VisualChef simplifies alignment through mask-based visual grounding. Our key
insight is identifying action-relevant objects and classifying them to enable
targeted modifications that reflect the intended action and outcome while
maintaining a consistent environment. In addition, we propose an automated
pipeline to extract high-quality initial, action, and final state frames. We
evaluate VisualChef quantitatively and qualitatively on three egocentric video
datasets and show its improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为2D Triangle Splatting（2DTS）的新方法，用2D三角形面片替代3D高斯基元，以解决现有方法在渲染速度和高级渲染效果上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于3D高斯基元的可微分渲染方法虽然在多视角图像重建高保真3D场景方面表现优异，但在渲染速度和高级渲染效果（如重新光照和阴影渲染）上仍存在挑战。

Method: 提出2DTS方法，用2D三角形面片替代3D高斯基元，结合紧凑性参数，直接训练出逼真的网格。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在未调整紧凑性参数的情况下，保真度优于现有高斯基元方法，且重建网格的视觉质量优于现有网格重建方法。

Conclusion: 2DTS方法在保留连续体积建模优势的同时，通过离散网格结构提升了渲染效果和速度。

Abstract: Differentiable rendering with 3D Gaussian primitives has emerged as a
powerful method for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D scenes from multi-view
images. While it offers improvements over NeRF-based methods, this
representation still encounters challenges with rendering speed and advanced
rendering effects, such as relighting and shadow rendering, compared to
mesh-based models. In this paper, we propose 2D Triangle Splatting (2DTS), a
novel method that replaces 3D Gaussian primitives with 2D triangle facelets.
This representation naturally forms a discrete mesh-like structure while
retaining the benefits of continuous volumetric modeling. By incorporating a
compactness parameter into the triangle primitives, we enable direct training
of photorealistic meshes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
triangle-based method, in its vanilla version (without compactness tuning),
achieves higher fidelity compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based methods.
Furthermore, our approach produces reconstructed meshes with superior visual
quality compared to existing mesh reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于重采样的对比自监督预训练方法，用于卫星图像时间序列（SITS），在缺乏标注数据的情况下有效利用未标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于卫星图像时间序列标注数据稀缺，而未标注数据丰富，需要一种有效的自监督学习方法。

Method: 引入了一种新颖的重采样增强策略，通过上采样时间序列并提取不重叠的子序列，同时保持时间覆盖。

Result: 在多个农业分类基准测试中表现优于常见方法（如抖动、调整大小和掩码），并在S2-Agri100数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为遥感时间序列提供了一种简单而有效的对比学习增强策略。

Abstract: Given the abundance of unlabeled Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) and the
scarcity of labeled data, contrastive self-supervised pretraining emerges as a
natural tool to leverage this vast quantity of unlabeled data. However,
designing effective data augmentations for contrastive learning remains
challenging for time series. We introduce a novel resampling-based augmentation
strategy that generates positive pairs by upsampling time series and extracting
disjoint subsequences while preserving temporal coverage. We validate our
approach on multiple agricultural classification benchmarks using Sentinel-2
imagery, showing that it outperforms common alternatives such as jittering,
resizing, and masking. Further, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
S2-Agri100 dataset without employing spatial information or temporal encodings,
surpassing more complex masked-based SSL frameworks. Our method offers a
simple, yet effective, contrastive learning augmentation for remote sensing
time series.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpaNN是一种新型对抗攻击检测器，其计算复杂度与对抗补丁数量无关，通过构建二值化特征图集合并聚类来检测攻击，性能优于现有防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法主要针对单补丁攻击，对多补丁攻击效果不佳或计算效率低，SpaNN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SpaNN通过应用一组显著性阈值构建二值化特征图集合，进行聚类后输入分类器进行攻击检测。

Result: 在四个数据集上，SpaNN在目标检测和图像分类任务中分别比现有方法提升11和27个百分点。

Conclusion: SpaNN是一种高效且鲁棒的对抗攻击检测方法，适用于多补丁攻击场景。

Abstract: State-of-the-art convolutional neural network models for object detection and
image classification are vulnerable to physically realizable adversarial
perturbations, such as patch attacks. Existing defenses have focused,
implicitly or explicitly, on single-patch attacks, leaving their sensitivity to
the number of patches as an open question or rendering them computationally
infeasible or inefficient against attacks consisting of multiple patches in the
worst cases. In this work, we propose SpaNN, an attack detector whose
computational complexity is independent of the expected number of adversarial
patches. The key novelty of the proposed detector is that it builds an ensemble
of binarized feature maps by applying a set of saliency thresholds to the
neural activations of the first convolutional layer of the victim model. It
then performs clustering on the ensemble and uses the cluster features as the
input to a classifier for attack detection. Contrary to existing detectors,
SpaNN does not rely on a fixed saliency threshold for identifying adversarial
regions, which makes it robust against white box adversarial attacks. We
evaluate SpaNN on four widely used data sets for object detection and
classification, and our results show that SpaNN outperforms state-of-the-art
defenses by up to 11 and 27 percentage points in the case of object detection
and the case of image classification, respectively. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成技术在视觉质量上进步显著，但在真实物理一致性上仍有不足，且现有方法依赖昂贵的人工标注或不可行的奖励模型。

Method: RDPO通过反向采样真实视频序列自动构建偏好对，并采用多阶段迭代训练优化生成器。

Result: RDPO显著提升了生成视频的动作连贯性和物理真实感，在多个基准测试和人类评估中表现优异。

Conclusion: RDPO为视频生成中的物理一致性提供了一种高效且无需标注的解决方案。

Abstract: Video generation techniques have achieved remarkable advancements in visual
quality, yet faithfully reproducing real-world physics remains elusive.
Preference-based model post-training may improve physical consistency, but
requires costly human-annotated datasets or reward models that are not yet
feasible. To address these challenges, we present Real Data Preference
Optimisation (RDPO), an annotation-free framework that distills physical priors
directly from real-world videos. Specifically, the proposed RDPO
reverse-samples real video sequences with a pre-trained generator to
automatically build preference pairs that are statistically distinguishable in
terms of physical correctness. A multi-stage iterative training schedule then
guides the generator to obey physical laws increasingly well. Benefiting from
the dynamic information explored from real videos, our proposed RDPO
significantly improves the action coherence and physical realism of the
generated videos. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks and human evaluations have
demonstrated that RDPO achieves improvements across multiple dimensions. The
source code and demonstration of this paper are available at:

Abstract: Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces
two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2)
inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework
for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists'
diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to
provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from
pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A
bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token
and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and
retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment
between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder
integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation.
Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's
superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative
improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for
Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the
necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide
WSI-relevant rich semantic content and suppress information redundancy in WSIs.

Motivation: 由于病理学基础模型的多样性，需要设计真实世界的挑战来评估其有效性，尤其是在处理大规模全切片图像时。

Method: 利用AI4SkIN数据集，设计了一个基准测试，将基础模型作为特征提取器嵌入多实例学习分类框架，并提出了FM-SI指标。

Result: 实验表明，提取较少偏差的特征可以提高分类性能，特别是在基于相似性的多实例学习分类器中。

Conclusion: 该研究为病理学基础模型的评估提供了新工具，并展示了其在复杂任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Pretraining on large-scale, in-domain datasets grants histopathology
foundation models (FM) the ability to learn task-agnostic data representations,
enhancing transfer learning on downstream tasks. In computational pathology,
automated whole slide image analysis requires multiple instance learning (MIL)
frameworks due to the gigapixel scale of the slides. The diversity among
histopathology FMs has highlighted the need to design real-world challenges for
evaluating their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel
benchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors
within a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the
AI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging
cutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model -
Silhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against
distribution shifts. Our experimentation shows that extracting less biased
features enhances classification performance, especially in similarity-based
MIL classifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割面临边界模糊和类别不平衡的挑战，现有方法缺乏语义先验，难以处理低对比度或重叠目标。

Method: MedSeg-R分为认知阶段（解析医学报告生成语义先验）和感知阶段（通过空间注意力、动态卷积和可变形采样调制SAM主干）。

Result: 在挑战性基准测试中，MedSeg-R显著提高了Dice分数，尤其在重叠和模糊结构上表现优异。

Conclusion: MedSeg-R通过嵌入细粒度语义先验，有效解决了医学图像分割中的难题，展示了与SAM系统的兼容性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is challenging due to overlapping anatomies with
ambiguous boundaries and a severe imbalance between the foreground and
background classes, which particularly affects the delineation of small
lesions. Existing methods, including encoder-decoder networks and prompt-driven
variants of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), rely heavily on local cues or
user prompts and lack integrated semantic priors, thus failing to generalize
well to low-contrast or overlapping targets. To address these issues, we
propose MedSeg-R, a lightweight, dual-stage framework inspired by inspired by
clinical reasoning. Its cognitive stage interprets medical report into
structured semantic priors (location, texture, shape), which are fused via
transformer block. In the perceptual stage, these priors modulate the SAM
backbone: spatial attention highlights likely lesion regions, dynamic
convolution adapts feature filters to expected textures, and deformable
sampling refines spatial support. By embedding this fine-grained guidance
early, MedSeg-R disentangles inter-class confusion and amplifies minority-class
cues, greatly improving sensitivity to small lesions. In challenging
benchmarks, MedSeg-R produces large Dice improvements in overlapping and
ambiguous structures, demonstrating plug-and-play compatibility with SAM-based
systems.

Conclusion: 提出的框架和数据集推动了SLAM、3D重建和视觉基础模型的研究发展。

Abstract: Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown promising results
in dense visual SLAM. However, existing implicit SLAM algorithms are
constrained to single-agent scenarios, and fall difficulties in large-scale
scenes and long sequences. Existing NeRF-based multi-agent SLAM frameworks
cannot meet the constraints of communication bandwidth. To this end, we propose
the first distributed multi-agent collaborative neural SLAM framework with
hybrid scene representation, distributed camera tracking, intra-to-inter loop
closure, and online distillation for multiple submap fusion. A novel
triplane-grid joint scene representation method is proposed to improve scene
reconstruction. A novel intra-to-inter loop closure method is designed to
achieve local (single-agent) and global (multi-agent) consistency. We also
design a novel online distillation method to fuse the information of different
submaps to achieve global consistency. Furthermore, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no real-world dataset for NeRF-based/GS-based SLAM that
provides both continuous-time trajectories groundtruth and high-accuracy 3D
meshes groundtruth. To this end, we propose the first real-world Dense slam
(DES) dataset covering both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, ranging
from small rooms to large-scale outdoor scenes, with high-accuracy ground truth
for both 3D mesh and continuous-time camera trajectory. This dataset can
advance the development of the research in both SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and
visual foundation model. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in both mapping, tracking, and
communication. The dataset and code will open-source on

Result: 在五个医学影像数据集上表现出色，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MARL-MambaContour是一种准确且鲁棒的临床医学图像分割解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce MARL-MambaContour, the first contour-based medical image
segmentation framework based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Our
approach reframes segmentation as a multi-agent cooperation task focused on
generate topologically consistent object-level contours, addressing the
limitations of traditional pixel-based methods which could lack topological
constraints and holistic structural awareness of anatomical regions. Each
contour point is modeled as an autonomous agent that iteratively adjusts its
position to align precisely with the target boundary, enabling adaptation to
blurred edges and intricate morphologies common in medical images. This
iterative adjustment process is optimized by a contour-specific Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, further enhanced with the Entropy Regularization
Adjustment Mechanism (ERAM) which dynamically balance agent exploration with
contour smoothness. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a Mamba-based
policy network featuring a novel Bidirectional Cross-attention Hidden-state
Fusion Mechanism (BCHFM). This mechanism mitigates potential memory confusion
limitations associated with long-range modeling in state space models, thereby
facilitating more accurate inter-agent information exchange and informed
decision-making. Extensive experiments on five diverse medical imaging datasets
demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MARL-MambaContour, highlighting
its potential as an accurate and robust clinical application.

Motivation: 高光谱成像（HSI）在自动驾驶（AD）中具有潜力，但其高维光谱数据的高效处理仍是一大挑战。

Method: 提出MSAM模块，通过三种不同核大小的1D卷积和自适应特征聚合机制，将其集成到UNet的跳跃连接中（UNet-MSAM）。

Conclusion: 多尺度核组合优于单尺度配置，为AD中的HSI处理提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving (AD) have highlighted the potential of
Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) for enhanced environmental perception, particularly
in challenging weather and lighting conditions. However, efficiently processing
its high-dimensional spectral data remains a significant challenge. This paper
introduces a Multi-scale Spectral Attention Module (MSAM) that enhances
spectral feature extraction through three parallel 1D convolutions with varying
kernel sizes between 1 to 11, coupled with an adaptive feature aggregation
mechanism. By integrating MSAM into UNet's skip connections (UNet-SC), our
proposed UNet-MSAM achieves significant improvements in semantic segmentation
performance across multiple HSI datasets: HyKo-VIS v2, HSI-Drive v2, and
Hyperspectral City v2. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that with
minimal computational overhead (on average 0.02% in parameters and 0.82%
GFLOPS), UNet-MSAM consistently outperforms UNet-SC, achieving average
improvements of 3.61% in mean IoU and 3.80% in mF1 across the three datasets.
Through extensive ablation studies, we have established that multi-scale kernel
combinations perform better than single-scale configurations. These findings
demonstrate the potential of HSI processing for AD and provide valuable
insights into designing robust, multi-scale spectral feature extractors for
real-world applications.

Motivation: 解决传统图像分类模型在数字化植物标本分类中因背景复杂、非植物元素和遮挡导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 采用像素到点的转换技术，将2D对象掩码转为3D点云，结合CNN和PointNet编码器提取并融合特征。

Result: 在植物标本数据集上，SIM-Net比ResNet101准确率提升9.9%，F-score提升12.3%，优于多种先进架构。

Conclusion: SIM-Net通过融合3D几何特征显著提升了2D图像分类性能，尤其在复杂背景下表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce the Shape-Image Multimodal Network (SIM-Net), a novel 2D image
classification architecture that integrates 3D point cloud representations
inferred directly from RGB images. Our key contribution lies in a
pixel-to-point transformation that converts 2D object masks into 3D point
clouds, enabling the fusion of texture-based and geometric features for
enhanced classification performance. SIM-Net is particularly well-suited for
the classification of digitized herbarium specimens (a task made challenging by
heterogeneous backgrounds), non-plant elements, and occlusions that compromise
conventional image-based models. To address these issues, SIM-Net employs a
segmentation-based preprocessing step to extract object masks prior to 3D point
cloud generation. The architecture comprises a CNN encoder for 2D image
features and a PointNet-based encoder for geometric features, which are fused
into a unified latent space. Experimental evaluations on herbarium datasets
demonstrate that SIM-Net consistently outperforms ResNet101, achieving gains of
up to 9.9% in accuracy and 12.3% in F-score. It also surpasses several
transformer-based state-of-the-art architectures, highlighting the benefits of
incorporating 3D structural reasoning into 2D image classification tasks.

Conclusion: Matrix-Game为交互式图像到世界生成提供了高效解决方案，并开源模型和评测基准。

Abstract: We introduce Matrix-Game, an interactive world foundation model for
controllable game world generation. Matrix-Game is trained using a two-stage
pipeline that first performs large-scale unlabeled pretraining for environment
understanding, followed by action-labeled training for interactive video
generation. To support this, we curate Matrix-Game-MC, a comprehensive
Minecraft dataset comprising over 2,700 hours of unlabeled gameplay video clips
and over 1,000 hours of high-quality labeled clips with fine-grained keyboard
and mouse action annotations. Our model adopts a controllable image-to-world
generation paradigm, conditioned on a reference image, motion context, and user
actions. With over 17 billion parameters, Matrix-Game enables precise control
over character actions and camera movements, while maintaining high visual
quality and temporal coherence. To evaluate performance, we develop GameWorld
Score, a unified benchmark measuring visual quality, temporal quality, action
controllability, and physical rule understanding for Minecraft world
generation. Extensive experiments show that Matrix-Game consistently
outperforms prior open-source Minecraft world models (including Oasis and
MineWorld) across all metrics, with particularly strong gains in
controllability and physical consistency. Double-blind human evaluations
further confirm the superiority of Matrix-Game, highlighting its ability to
generate perceptually realistic and precisely controllable videos across
diverse game scenarios. To facilitate future research on interactive
image-to-world generation, we will open-source the Matrix-Game model weights
and the GameWorld Score benchmark at https://github.com/SkyworkAI/Matrix-Game.

Abstract: Effective human action recognition is widely used for cobots in Industry 4.0
to assist in assembly tasks. However, conventional skeleton-based methods often
lose keypoint semantics, limiting their effectiveness in complex interactions.
In this work, we introduce a novel approach to skeleton-based action
recognition that enriches input representations by leveraging word embeddings
to encode semantic information. Our method replaces one-hot encodings with
semantic volumes, enabling the model to capture meaningful relationships
between joints and objects. Through extensive experiments on multiple assembly
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves
classification performance, and enhances generalization capabilities by
simultaneously supporting different skeleton types and object classes. Our
findings highlight the potential of incorporating semantic information to
enhance skeleton-based action recognition in dynamic and diverse environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物识别模板一旦泄露无法撤销的问题，提出可撤销的生物识别方案。

Method: 利用深度CNN生成多个识别能力相同但模板不兼容的模型，并探索Vision Transformer的适用性。

Result: 生成的模型具有等效识别能力且模板不兼容，Vision Transformer表现不如ResNet。

Conclusion: 深度CNN支持可撤销的生物识别方案，Vision Transformer在此场景下不适用。

Abstract: One common critique of biometric authentication is that if an individual's
biometric is compromised, then the individual has no recourse. The concept of
revocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme
is revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme
revoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the
individual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition
power. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust
revocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and
training set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face
matcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)
strongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power
extends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have
the same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the
models can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The
biometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible
that the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is
typically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different
persons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value
in attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor
template. We also explore the feasibility of using a Vision Transformer (ViT)
backbone-based face matcher in the revocable biometric system proposed in this
work and demonstrate that it is less suitable compared to typical ResNet-based
deep CNN backbones.

the radar-camera matching in improving object tracking accuracy and reliability
for autonomous driving in waterborne environments. The USVTrack dataset is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的SOP方法在注意力计算中缺乏对空间结构的显式建模，导致几何感知能力有限，在稀疏或遮挡区域表现不佳。

Method: 提出了空间感知窗口注意力（SWA）机制，将局部空间上下文信息融入注意力计算中。

Result: SWA显著提升了场景完成度，并在LiDAR和相机两种模态的SOP基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: SWA机制通过显式建模空间结构，有效提升了语义占用预测的性能，尤其在稀疏或遮挡区域表现优异。

Abstract: Perception systems in autonomous driving rely on sensors such as LiDAR and
cameras to perceive the 3D environment. However, due to occlusions and data
sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic
Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy
and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods
lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting
in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded
areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel
mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA
significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results
on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by
integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields
consistent gains across modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估生成3D模型的指标与人类感知质量不一致，缺乏有效的评估方法。

Method: 开发3D Arena平台，通过成对比较收集人类偏好数据，使用ELO排名系统和统计欺诈检测。

Result: 收集了123,243票数据，发现Gaussian splat和纹理模型更受欢迎，提供了改进评估方法的建议。

Conclusion: 3D Arena成为生成3D模型评估的基准，推动了以人为中心的评估方法的发展。

Abstract: Evaluating Generative 3D models remains challenging due to misalignment
between automated metrics and human perception of quality. Current benchmarks
rely on image-based metrics that ignore 3D structure or geometric measures that
fail to capture perceptual appeal and real-world utility. To address this gap,
we present 3D Arena, an open platform for evaluating image-to-3D generation
models through large-scale human preference collection using pairwise
comparisons.
  Since launching in June 2024, the platform has collected 123,243 votes from
8,096 users across 19 state-of-the-art models, establishing the largest human
preference evaluation for Generative 3D. We contribute the iso3d dataset of 100
evaluation prompts and demonstrate quality control achieving 99.75% user
authenticity through statistical fraud detection. Our ELO-based ranking system
provides reliable model assessment, with the platform becoming an established
evaluation resource.
  Through analysis of this preference data, we present insights into human
preference patterns. Our findings reveal preferences for visual presentation
features, with Gaussian splat outputs achieving a 16.6 ELO advantage over
meshes and textured models receiving a 144.1 ELO advantage over untextured
models. We provide recommendations for improving evaluation methods, including
multi-criteria assessment, task-oriented evaluation, and format-aware
comparison. The platform's community engagement establishes 3D Arena as a
benchmark for the field while advancing understanding of human-centered
evaluation in Generative 3D.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的Super-Pixel Based Patch Pooling (SPPP)技术和Light Latent Attention (LLA)模块，以减少Vision Transformers的计算和内存需求，提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在计算和内存资源上依赖严重，且任务迁移学习困难，主要源于计算密集的自注意力机制。

Method: 通过SPPP生成语义丰富的补丁嵌入，结合LLA模块引入潜在令牌，降低注意力模块的时间和空间复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了计算效率，同时保持了与现有最佳方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法适合边缘部署，具有高效节能的潜力。

Abstract: The evolution of Vision Transformers has led to their widespread adaptation
to different domains. Despite large-scale success, there remain significant
challenges including their reliance on extensive computational and memory
resources for pre-training on huge datasets as well as difficulties in
task-specific transfer learning. These limitations coupled with energy
inefficiencies mainly arise due to the computation-intensive self-attention
mechanism. To address these issues, we propose a novel Super-Pixel Based Patch
Pooling (SPPP) technique that generates context-aware, semantically rich, patch
embeddings to effectively reduce the architectural complexity and improve
efficiency. Additionally, we introduce the Light Latent Attention (LLA) module
in our pipeline by integrating latent tokens into the attention mechanism
allowing cross-attention operations to significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of the attention module. By leveraging the data-intuitive patch
embeddings coupled with dynamic positional encodings, our approach adaptively
modulates the cross-attention process to focus on informative regions while
maintaining the global semantic structure. This targeted attention improves
training efficiency and accelerates convergence. Notably, the SPPP module is
lightweight and can be easily integrated into existing transformer
architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed architecture
provides significant improvements in terms of computational efficiency while
achieving comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting
its potential for energy-efficient transformers suitable for edge deployment.

Result: 在DyCheck基准测试中，ViDAR在视觉质量和几何一致性上优于现有方法，尤其在动态区域表现突出。

Conclusion: ViDAR通过扩散模型和优化策略，显著提升了动态新视角合成的性能，并提供了新的基准测试。

Abstract: Dynamic Novel View Synthesis aims to generate photorealistic views of moving
subjects from arbitrary viewpoints. This task is particularly challenging when
relying on monocular video, where disentangling structure from motion is
ill-posed and supervision is scarce. We introduce Video Diffusion-Aware
Reconstruction (ViDAR), a novel 4D reconstruction framework that leverages
personalised diffusion models to synthesise a pseudo multi-view supervision
signal for training a Gaussian splatting representation. By conditioning on
scene-specific features, ViDAR recovers fine-grained appearance details while
mitigating artefacts introduced by monocular ambiguity. To address the
spatio-temporal inconsistency of diffusion-based supervision, we propose a
diffusion-aware loss function and a camera pose optimisation strategy that
aligns synthetic views with the underlying scene geometry. Experiments on
DyCheck, a challenging benchmark with extreme viewpoint variation, show that
ViDAR outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines in visual quality and
geometric consistency. We further highlight ViDAR's strong improvement over
baselines on dynamic regions and provide a new benchmark to compare performance
in reconstructing motion-rich parts of the scene. Project page:

Result: 显著提升了前景物体的预测精度，在SemanticKITTI上实现了所有类别的最优性能。

Conclusion: OC-SOP通过目标中心信息的整合，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，提升了语义占用预测的整体性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving perception faces significant challenges due to occlusions
and incomplete scene data in the environment. To overcome these issues, the
task of semantic occupancy prediction (SOP) is proposed, which aims to jointly
infer both the geometry and semantic labels of a scene from images. However,
conventional camera-based methods typically treat all categories equally and
primarily rely on local features, leading to suboptimal predictions, especially
for dynamic foreground objects. To address this, we propose Object-Centric SOP
(OC-SOP), a framework that integrates high-level object-centric cues extracted
via a detection branch into the semantic occupancy prediction pipeline. This
object-centric integration significantly enhances the prediction accuracy for
foreground objects and achieves state-of-the-art performance among all
categories on SemanticKITTI.

Abstract: Real-time, on-device segmentation is critical for latency-sensitive and
privacy-aware applications like smart glasses and IoT devices. We introduce
PicoSAM2, a lightweight (1.3M parameters, 336M MACs) promptable segmentation
model optimized for edge and in-sensor execution, including the Sony IMX500. It
builds on a depthwise separable U-Net, with knowledge distillation and
fixed-point prompt encoding to learn from the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2).
On COCO and LVIS, it achieves 51.9% and 44.9% mIoU, respectively. The quantized
model (1.22MB) runs at 14.3 ms on the IMX500-achieving 86 MACs/cycle, making it
the only model meeting both memory and compute constraints for in-sensor
deployment. Distillation boosts LVIS performance by +3.5% mIoU and +5.1% mAP.
These results demonstrate that efficient, promptable segmentation is feasible
directly on-camera, enabling privacy-preserving vision without cloud or host

Abstract: We propose the first framework capable of computing a 4D spatio-temporal grid
of video frames and 3D Gaussian particles for each time step using a
feed-forward architecture. Our architecture has two main components, a 4D video
model and a 4D reconstruction model. In the first part, we analyze current 4D
video diffusion architectures that perform spatial and temporal attention
either sequentially or in parallel within a two-stream design. We highlight the
limitations of existing approaches and introduce a novel fused architecture
that performs spatial and temporal attention within a single layer. The key to
our method is a sparse attention pattern, where tokens attend to others in the
same frame, at the same timestamp, or from the same viewpoint. In the second
part, we extend existing 3D reconstruction algorithms by introducing a Gaussian
head, a camera token replacement algorithm, and additional dynamic layers and
training. Overall, we establish a new state of the art for 4D generation,
improving both visual quality and reconstruction capability.

Result: 实验表明，使用Phantom-Data训练显著提升指令对齐和视觉质量，同时保持身份一致性。

Conclusion: Phantom-Data是首个通用跨对主题到视频一致性数据集，有效解决现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Subject-to-video generation has witnessed substantial progress in recent
years. However, existing models still face significant challenges in faithfully
following textual instructions. This limitation, commonly known as the
copy-paste problem, arises from the widely used in-pair training paradigm. This
approach inherently entangles subject identity with background and contextual
attributes by sampling reference images from the same scene as the target
video. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{Phantom-Data, the first
general-purpose cross-pair subject-to-video consistency dataset}, containing
approximately one million identity-consistent pairs across diverse categories.
Our dataset is constructed via a three-stage pipeline: (1) a general and
input-aligned subject detection module, (2) large-scale cross-context subject
retrieval from more than 53 million videos and 3 billion images, and (3)
prior-guided identity verification to ensure visual consistency under
contextual variation. Comprehensive experiments show that training with
Phantom-Data significantly improves prompt alignment and visual quality while
preserving identity consistency on par with in-pair baselines.

by integrating both visual and geometric cues. Our RAG-6DPose roughly contains
three stages: 1) Building a Multi-Modal CAD Knowledge Base by extracting 2D
visual features from multi-view CAD rendered images and also attaching 3D
points; 2) Retrieving relevant CAD features from the knowledge base based on
the current query image via our ReSPC module; and 3) Incorporating retrieved

Result: 实验表明TAMMs在时间变化理解和未来图像预测任务中优于现有MLLMs。

Conclusion: 精心设计的时间推理和语义融合能充分发挥MLLMs在时空理解中的潜力。

Abstract: Satellite image time-series analysis demands fine-grained spatial-temporal
reasoning, which remains a challenge for existing multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). In this work, we study the capabilities of MLLMs on a novel
task that jointly targets temporal change understanding and future scene
generation, aiming to assess their potential for modeling complex multimodal
dynamics over time. We propose TAMMs, a Temporal-Aware Multimodal Model for
satellite image change understanding and forecasting, which enhances frozen
MLLMs with lightweight temporal modules for structured sequence encoding and
contextual prompting. To guide future image generation, TAMMs introduces a
Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism that adaptively combines
high-level semantic reasoning and structural priors within an enhanced
ControlNet. This dual-path conditioning enables temporally consistent and
semantically grounded image synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that TAMMs
outperforms strong MLLM baselines in both temporal change understanding and
future image forecasting tasks, highlighting how carefully designed temporal
reasoning and semantic fusion can unlock the full potential of MLLMs for
spatio-temporal understanding.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in audio-driven human animation, while
most existing methods focus mainly on facial movements, limiting their ability
to create full-body animations with natural synchronization and fluidity. They
also struggle with precise prompt control for fine-grained generation. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce OmniAvatar, an innovative audio-driven
full-body video generation model that enhances human animation with improved
lip-sync accuracy and natural movements. OmniAvatar introduces a pixel-wise
multi-hierarchical audio embedding strategy to better capture audio features in
the latent space, enhancing lip-syncing across diverse scenes. To preserve the
capability for prompt-driven control of foundation models while effectively
incorporating audio features, we employ a LoRA-based training approach.
Extensive experiments show that OmniAvatar surpasses existing models in both
facial and semi-body video generation, offering precise text-based control for
creating videos in various domains, such as podcasts, human interactions,
dynamic scenes, and singing. Our project page is

TL;DR: MVAA框架通过两步法自动对齐视频与音乐节奏，保留原视频内容，提升视觉流畅度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频与音乐节奏对齐是多媒体制作的实际需求，现有方法依赖手动或启发式编辑，灵活性不足。

Method: MVAA分为两步：1) 对齐运动关键帧与音频节拍；2) 使用扩散模型生成连贯中间帧。采用两阶段训练策略提升效率。

Result: 实验表明，MVAA能高质量对齐节拍并保持视觉流畅，单GPU上10分钟内完成适配。

Conclusion: MVAA提供了一种高效、灵活的视频与音乐自动对齐方法，适用于多种多媒体场景。

Abstract: Aligning the rhythm of visual motion in a video with a given music track is a
practical need in multimedia production, yet remains an underexplored task in
autonomous video editing. Effective alignment between motion and musical beats
enhances viewer engagement and visual appeal, particularly in music videos,
promotional content, and cinematic editing. Existing methods typically depend
on labor-intensive manual cutting, speed adjustments, or heuristic-based
editing techniques to achieve synchronization. While some generative models
handle joint video and music generation, they often entangle the two
modalities, limiting flexibility in aligning video to music beats while
preserving the full visual content. In this paper, we propose a novel and
efficient framework, termed MVAA (Music-Video Auto-Alignment), that
automatically edits video to align with the rhythm of a given music track while
preserving the original visual content. To enhance flexibility, we modularize
the task into a two-step process in our MVAA: aligning motion keyframes with
audio beats, followed by rhythm-aware video inpainting. Specifically, we first
insert keyframes at timestamps aligned with musical beats, then use a
frame-conditioned diffusion model to generate coherent intermediate frames,
preserving the original video's semantic content. Since comprehensive test-time
training can be time-consuming, we adopt a two-stage strategy: pretraining the
inpainting module on a small video set to learn general motion priors, followed
by rapid inference-time fine-tuning for video-specific adaptation. This hybrid
approach enables adaptation within 10 minutes with one epoch on a single NVIDIA
4090 GPU using CogVideoX-5b-I2V as the backbone. Extensive experiments show
that our approach can achieve high-quality beat alignment and visual
smoothness.

Abstract: Universal photometric stereo (PS) aims to recover high-quality surface
normals from objects under arbitrary lighting conditions without relying on
specific illumination models. Despite recent advances such as SDM-UniPS and Uni
MS-PS, two fundamental challenges persist: 1) the deep coupling between varying
illumination and surface normal features, where ambiguity in observed intensity
makes it difficult to determine whether brightness variations stem from
lighting changes or surface orientation; and 2) the preservation of
high-frequency geometric details in complex surfaces, where intricate
geometries create self-shadowing, inter-reflections, and subtle normal
variations that conventional feature processing operations struggle to capture
accurately.

Conclusion: UniTime为复杂视频理解任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a computational model for universal video temporal
grounding, which accurately localizes temporal moments in videos based on
natural language queries (e.g., questions or descriptions). Unlike existing
methods that are often limited to specific video domains or durations, we
propose UniTime, a robust and universal video grounding model leveraging the
strong vision-language understanding capabilities of generative Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our model effectively handles videos of diverse
views, genres, and lengths while comprehending complex language queries. The
key contributions include: (i) We consider steering strong MLLMs for temporal
grounding in videos. To enable precise timestamp outputs, we incorporate
temporal information by interleaving timestamp tokens with video tokens. (ii)
By training the model to handle videos with different input granularities
through adaptive frame scaling, our approach achieves robust temporal grounding
for both short and long videos. (iii) Comprehensive experiments show that
UniTime outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both zero-shot and
dataset-specific finetuned settings across five public temporal grounding
benchmarks. (iv) When employed as a preliminary moment retriever for long-form
video question-answering (VideoQA), UniTime significantly improves VideoQA
accuracy, highlighting its value for complex video understanding tasks.

Motivation: 探索如何通过4D预训练学习通用的时空表示，实现从少量视角和时间点重建物体到任意视角和时间点的能力。

Method: 4D-LRM通过学习统一的时空表示，直接从时间序列的姿势图像标记预测每像素的4D高斯基元，支持快速高质量渲染。

Conclusion: 4D-LRM证明了时空预训练的扩展性，能够高效、准确地进行4D重建。

Abstract: Can we scale 4D pretraining to learn general space-time representations that
reconstruct an object from a few views at some times to any view at any time?
We provide an affirmative answer with 4D-LRM, the first large-scale 4D
reconstruction model that takes input from unconstrained views and timestamps
and renders arbitrary novel view-time combinations. Unlike prior 4D approaches,
e.g., optimization-based, geometry-based, or generative, that struggle with
efficiency, generalization, or faithfulness, 4D-LRM learns a unified space-time
representation and directly predicts per-pixel 4D Gaussian primitives from
posed image tokens across time, enabling fast, high-quality rendering at, in
principle, infinite frame rate. Our results demonstrate that scaling
spatiotemporal pretraining enables accurate and efficient 4D reconstruction. We
show that 4D-LRM generalizes to novel objects, interpolates across time, and
handles diverse camera setups. It reconstructs 24-frame sequences in one
forward pass with less than 1.5 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

TL;DR: FilMaster是一个端到端AI系统，通过整合真实世界的电影原则，生成专业级电影内容，解决了现有系统在镜头语言和节奏上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI电影生成系统缺乏多样化的镜头语言和电影节奏，导致视觉效果模板化和叙事不吸引人。

Method: FilMaster分为两个阶段：参考引导生成阶段（利用44万电影片段库生成专业镜头语言）和生成后期制作阶段（模拟观众反馈优化视听节奏）。

Result: FilMaster在镜头语言设计和电影节奏控制上表现优异，推动了生成式AI在专业电影制作中的应用。

Conclusion: FilMaster通过结合真实电影原则和生成式AI模型，显著提升了AI生成电影的专业性和吸引力。

Abstract: AI-driven content creation has shown potential in film production. However,
existing film generation systems struggle to implement cinematic principles and
thus fail to generate professional-quality films, particularly lacking diverse
camera language and cinematic rhythm. This results in templated visuals and
unengaging narratives. To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end
AI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for
professional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard
outputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography
from extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional,
audience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles,
FilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which
transforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage
which transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual
and auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a
Multi-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in
generating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a
vast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates
professional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm
Control module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by
simulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements
to achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models
like (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films. Extensive
experiments show FilMaster's superior performance in camera language design and
cinematic rhythm control, advancing generative AI in professional filmmaking.

Result: 定量和定性实验显示，该方法在多面板一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效提升故事可视化的视觉一致性，且模型无关，灵活性高。

Abstract: Story visualization has become a popular task where visual scenes are
generated to depict a narrative across multiple panels. A central challenge in
this setting is maintaining visual consistency, particularly in how characters
and objects persist and evolve throughout the story. Despite recent advances in
diffusion models, current approaches often fail to preserve key character
attributes, leading to incoherent narratives. In this work, we propose a
collaborative multi-agent framework that autonomously identifies, corrects, and
refines inconsistencies across multi-panel story visualizations. The agents
operate in an iterative loop, enabling fine-grained, panel-level updates
without re-generating entire sequences. Our framework is model-agnostic and
flexibly integrates with a variety of diffusion models, including rectified
flow transformers such as Flux and latent diffusion models such as Stable
Diffusion. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method
outperforms prior approaches in terms of multi-panel consistency.

Motivation: 现有技术多关注游戏风格视觉效果，而RealPlay致力于生成类似真实世界画面的视频。

Method: 采用迭代分块预测实现低延迟反馈，确保时间一致性，并结合标记游戏数据和无标记真实视频进行训练。

Result: RealPlay能够将虚拟控制信号映射到真实场景，并泛化到多种实体（如自行车、行人）。

Conclusion: RealPlay在无需真实世界动作标注的情况下，实现了逼真且响应迅速的交互式视频生成。

Abstract: We introduce RealPlay, a neural network-based real-world game engine that
enables interactive video generation from user control signals. Unlike prior
works focused on game-style visuals, RealPlay aims to produce photorealistic,
temporally consistent video sequences that resemble real-world footage. It
operates in an interactive loop: users observe a generated scene, issue a
control command, and receive a short video chunk in response. To enable such
realistic and responsive generation, we address key challenges including
iterative chunk-wise prediction for low-latency feedback, temporal consistency
across iterations, and accurate control response. RealPlay is trained on a
combination of labeled game data and unlabeled real-world videos, without
requiring real-world action annotations. Notably, we observe two forms of
generalization: (1) control transfer-RealPlay effectively maps control signals
from virtual to real-world scenarios; and (2) entity transfer-although training
labels originate solely from a car racing game, RealPlay generalizes to control
diverse real-world entities, including bicycles and pedestrians, beyond
vehicles. Project page can be found: https://wenqsun.github.io/RealPlay/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D场景重建或视频生成中存在误差累积或场景一致性难以长期维持的问题，需要一种更高效的记忆机制来提升性能。

Method: 通过基于3D表面元素（surfels）几何索引过去视图的VMem机制，高效检索相关视图以生成新视图，减少计算成本。

Result: 在长期场景合成基准测试中表现优异，显著优于现有方法，尤其在场景一致性和相机控制方面。

Conclusion: VMem机制为视频生成器提供了一种高效且一致的长期场景探索方法，具有较低的算力需求。

Abstract: We propose a novel memory mechanism to build video generators that can
explore environments interactively. Similar results have previously been
achieved by out-painting 2D views of the scene while incrementally
reconstructing its 3D geometry, which quickly accumulates errors, or by video
generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene
coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce
Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by
indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they
have observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past
views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our
method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction
of the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our
approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate
superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene
coherence and camera control.

Motivation: 现有视频重光照技术主要局限于肖像视频或面临时间一致性和计算效率的瓶颈，TC-Light旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出两阶段后优化机制：第一阶段优化外观嵌入以对齐全局光照，第二阶段优化唯一视频张量（UVT）以对齐细节纹理和光照。

Result: 实验表明，TC-Light能够实现物理上合理且时间一致的重光照结果，同时计算成本低。

Conclusion: TC-Light为复杂动态长视频的重光照提供了一种高效且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Editing illumination in long videos with complex dynamics has significant
value in various downstream tasks, including visual content creation and
manipulation, as well as data scaling up for embodied AI through sim2real and
real2real transfer. Nevertheless, existing video relighting techniques are
predominantly limited to portrait videos or fall into the bottleneck of
temporal consistency and computation efficiency. In this paper, we propose
TC-Light, a novel paradigm characterized by the proposed two-stage post
optimization mechanism. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an
inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first
stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical
video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained
texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate
performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark.
Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible
relighting results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

Motivation: 解决多代理系统中共享记忆同步和修剪的挑战，避免过时或无关数据的积累。

Method: 结合上下文感知语义投票、多尺度时间衰减函数和PBFT共识机制，利用gRPC和Pinecone等技术实现。

Result: 实验显示协议显著减少内存占用（52%），投票准确率88%，共识成功率92%，缓存命中率82%。

Conclusion: Co-Forgetting Protocol在多代理系统中有效管理共享记忆，提升系统效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The proliferation of multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex, dynamic
environments necessitates robust and efficient mechanisms for managing shared
knowledge. A critical challenge is ensuring that distributed memories remain
synchronized, relevant, and free from the accumulation of outdated or
inconsequential data - a process analogous to biological forgetting. This paper
introduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework
designed to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in
MAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic
voting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the
relevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational
context; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing
importance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different
time horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based
consensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items
are agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in
the presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N
greater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient
inter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage
and similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations
in a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's
efficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88%
voting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a
92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an
82% cache hit rate for memory access.

Conclusion: 该方法为局部搜索算法提供了高效的计算支持，并指出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Local search plays a central role in many effective heuristic algorithms for
the vehicle routing problem (VRP) and its variants. However, neighborhood
exploration is known to be computationally expensive and time consuming,
especially for large instances or problems with complex constraints. In this
study, we explore a promising direction to address this challenge by
introducing an original tensor-based GPU acceleration method designed to speed
up the commonly used local search operators in vehicle routing. By using an
attribute-based representation, the method offers broad extensibility, making
it applicable to different VRP variants. Its low-coupling architecture, with
intensive computations completely offloaded to the GPU, ensures seamless
integration in various local search-based algorithms and frameworks, leading to
significant improvements in computational efficiency and potentially improved
solution quality. Through comparative experiments on benchmark instances of
three routing problems, we demonstrate the substantial computational advantages
of the proposed approach over traditional CPU-based implementations. We also
provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and limitations of the method,
providing valuable insights into its performance characteristics and
identifying potential bottlenecks in practical applications. These findings
contribute to a better understanding and suggest directions for future
improvements.

Abstract: We present a novel parallelization strategy for evaluating Finite Element
Method (FEM) variational forms on GPUs, focusing on those that are expressible
through the Unified Form Language (UFL) on simplex meshes. We base our approach
on code transformations, wherein we construct a space of scheduling candidates
and rank them via a heuristic cost model to effectively handle the large
diversity of computational workloads that can be expressed in this way. We
present a design of a search space to which the cost model is applied, along
with an associated pruning strategy to limit the number of configurations that
need to be empirically evaluated. The goal of our design is to strike a balance
between the device's latency-hiding capabilities and the amount of state space,
a key factor in attaining near-roofline performance.
  To make our work widely available, we have prototyped our parallelization
strategy within the \textsc{Firedrake} framework, a UFL-based FEM solver. We
evaluate the performance of our parallelization scheme on two generations of
Nvidia GPUs, specifically the Titan V (Volta architecture) and Tesla K40c
(Kepler architecture), across a range of operators commonly used in
applications, including fluid dynamics, wave propagation, and structural
mechanics, in 2D and 3D geometries. Our results demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm achieves more than $50\%$ roofline performance in $65\%$ of the test
cases on both devices.

ConsumerBench, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to evaluate the
system efficiency and response time of GenAI models running on end-user

executing concurrently on constrained hardware. Furthermore, ConsumerBench
supports customizable workflows that simulate complex tasks requiring
coordination among multiple applications. ConsumerBench captures both
application-level metrics, including latency and Service Level Objective (SLO)
attainment, and system-level metrics like CPU/GPU utilization and memory
bandwidth. Through extensive experiments, ConsumerBench reveals inefficiencies
in resource sharing, unfair scheduling under greedy allocation, and performance
pitfalls of static model server configurations. The paper also provides
practical insights for model developers and system designers, highlighting the
benefits of custom kernels tailored to consumer-grade GPU architectures and the
value of implementing SLO-aware scheduling strategies.

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in recommendation
systems, the computational and communication bottlenecks caused by their
massive parameter sizes and large data volumes have become increasingly
prominent. This paper systematically investigates two classes of optimization
methods-model parallelism and data parallelism-for distributed training of LLMs
in recommendation scenarios. For model parallelism, we implement both tensor
parallelism and pipeline parallelism, and introduce an adaptive load-balancing
mechanism to reduce cross-device communication overhead. For data parallelism,
we compare synchronous and asynchronous modes, combining gradient compression
and sparsification techniques with an efficient aggregation communication
framework to significantly improve bandwidth utilization. Experiments conducted
on a real-world recommendation dataset in a simulated service environment
demonstrate that our proposed hybrid parallelism scheme increases training
throughput by over 30% and improves resource utilization by approximately 20%
compared to traditional single-mode parallelism, while maintaining strong
scalability and robustness. Finally, we discuss trade-offs among different
parallel strategies in online deployment and outline future directions
involving heterogeneous hardware integration and automated scheduling
technologies.

Abstract: Butterflies, or 4-cycles in bipartite graphs, are crucial for identifying
cohesive structures and dense subgraphs. While agent-based data mining is
gaining prominence, its application to bipartite networks remains relatively
unexplored. We propose distributed, agent-based algorithms for \emph{Butterfly
Counting} in a bipartite graph $G((A,B),E)$. Agents first determine their
respective partitions and collaboratively construct a spanning tree, electing a
leader within $O(n \log \lambda)$ rounds using only $O(\log \lambda)$ bits per
agent. A novel meeting mechanism between adjacent agents improves efficiency
and eliminates the need for prior knowledge of the graph, requiring only the
highest agent ID $\lambda$ among the $n$ agents. Notably, our techniques
naturally extend to general graphs, where leader election and spanning tree
construction maintain the same round and memory complexities. Building on these
foundations, agents count butterflies per node in $O(\Delta)$ rounds and
compute the total butterfly count of $G$ in $O(\Delta+\min\{|A|,|B|\})$ rounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着计算资源需求的增长和电力成本上升，数据中心需要更高效的电力系统，而选择合适的电池模型是关键挑战。

Method: 在Vessim仿真框架中实现并比较了四种电池模型，包括线性模型和复杂物理模型。

Result: 线性模型在短期实验中与复杂物理模型表现接近，且仿真速度更快，配置更简单。

Conclusion: 线性模型是数据中心仿真中的理想选择，平衡了速度、准确性和易用性。

Abstract: As demand for computing resources continues to rise, the increasing cost of
electricity and anticipated regulations on carbon emissions are prompting
changes in data center power systems. Many providers are now operating compute
nodes in microgrids, close to renewable power generators and energy storage, to
maintain full control over the cost and origin of consumed electricity.
Recently, new co-simulation testbeds have emerged that integrate
domain-specific simulators to support research, development, and testing of
such systems in a controlled environment. Yet, choosing an appropriate battery
model for data center simulations remains challenging, as it requires balancing
simulation speed, realism, and ease of configuration.
  In this paper, we implement four different battery models for data center
scenarios within the co-simulation framework Vessim and analyze their behavior.
The results show that linear models, which consider inefficiencies and power
limits, closely match the behavior of complex physics-based models in
short-term experiments while offering faster execution, and not requiring
knowledge on electrochemical reactions and circuit-level dynamics. In contrast,
simple, lossless models fail to accurately represent complex behavior and
provide no further runtime advantage.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在完全分布式环境中维护鲁棒且稀疏的覆盖网络的问题，提出了一种动态网络中的扩展器拓扑协议，能够抵御高频率的节点变动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的非结构化P2P网络需要维护低度数但高连通性的通信图，而现有方法在动态节点变动（churn）环境下表现不足。

Method: 扩展了Becchetti等人的随机连接策略，结合Augustine等人的分析框架，提出了一种分布式算法，能够在对抗性节点变动下维护扩展器图。

Result: 算法在高概率下维护了常数度数的扩展器图，即使每轮节点变动率高达O(n/polylog(n))。

Conclusion: 该协议解决了先前工作中的开放问题，提供了一种简单、完全分布式且具有理论保证的churn弹性协议。

Abstract: We study the problem of maintaining robust and sparse overlay networks in
fully distributed settings where nodes continuously join and leave the system.
This scenario closely models real-world unstructured peer-to-peer networks,
where maintaining a well-connected yet low-degree communication graph is
crucial. We generalize a recent protocol by Becchetti et al. [SODA 2020] that
relies on a simple randomized connection strategy to build an expander topology
with high probability to a dynamic networks with churn setting. In this work,
the network dynamism is governed by an oblivious adversary that controls which
nodes join and leave the system in each round. The adversary has full knowledge
of the system and unbounded computational power, but cannot see the random
choices made by the protocol. Our analysis builds on the framework of Augustine
et al. [FOCS 2015], and shows that our distributed algorithm maintains a
constant-degree expander graph with high probability, despite a continuous
adversarial churn with a rate of up to $\mathcal{O}(n/polylog(n))$ per round,
where $n$ is the stable network size. The protocol and proof techniques are not
new, but together they resolve a specific open problem raised in prior work.
The result is a simple, fully distributed, and churn-resilient protocol with
provable guarantees that align with observed empirical behavior.

Abstract: Telerobotics is a key foundation in autonomous Industrial Cyber-Physical
Systems (ICPS), enabling remote operations across various domains. However,
conventional cloud-based telerobotics suffers from latency, reliability,
scalability, and resilience issues, hindering real-time performance in critical
applications. Cloud-Fog Telerobotics (CFTel) builds on the Cloud-Fog Automation
(CFA) paradigm to address these limitations by leveraging a distributed
Cloud-Edge-Robotics computing architecture, enabling deterministic
connectivity, deterministic connected intelligence, and deterministic networked

highlight its role in facilitating scalable, low-latency, autonomous, and
AI-driven telerobotics. We analyze architectural frameworks and technologies
that enable them, including 5G Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication, Edge
Intelligence, Embodied AI, and Digital Twins. The study demonstrates that CFTel
has the potential to enhance real-time control, scalability, and autonomy while
supporting service-oriented solutions. We also discuss practical challenges,
including latency constraints, cybersecurity risks, interoperability issues,
and standardization efforts. This work serves as a foundational reference for
researchers, stakeholders, and industry practitioners in future telerobotics

Abstract: Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) technologies are foundational in
driving maritime autonomy, particularly for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs).
However, onboard computational constraints and communication latency
significantly restrict real-time data processing, analysis, and predictive
modeling, hence limiting the scalability and responsiveness of maritime ICPS.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a distributed Cloud-Edge-IoT
architecture tailored for maritime ICPS by leveraging design principles from
the recently proposed Cloud-Fog Automation paradigm. Our proposed architecture
comprises three hierarchical layers: a Cloud Layer for centralized and
decentralized data aggregation, advanced analytics, and future model
refinement; an Edge Layer that executes localized AI-driven processing and
decision-making; and an IoT Layer responsible for low-latency sensor data
acquisition. Our experimental results demonstrated improvements in
computational efficiency, responsiveness, and scalability. When compared with
our conventional approaches, we achieved a classification accuracy of 86\%,
with an improved latency performance. By adopting Cloud-Fog Automation, we
address the low-latency processing constraints and scalability challenges in
maritime ICPS applications. Our work offers a practical, modular, and scalable
framework to advance robust autonomy and AI-driven decision-making and autonomy
for intelligent USVs in future maritime ICPS.

Result: 框架通过合成数据缓解非独立同分布问题，并通过奖励机制提高工人参与度。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了FL中的统计问题和工人激励问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: In recent years, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a widely adopted
privacy-preserving distributed training approach, attracting significant
interest from both academia and industry. Research efforts have been dedicated
to improving different aspects of FL, such as algorithm improvement, resource
allocation, and client selection, to enable its deployment in distributed edge
networks for practical applications. One of the reasons for the poor FL model
performance is due to the worker dropout during training as the FL server may
be located far away from the FL workers. To address this issue, an Hierarchical
Federated Learning (HFL) framework has been introduced, incorporating an
additional layer of edge servers to relay communication between the FL server
and workers. While the HFL framework improves the communication between the FL
server and workers, large number of communication rounds may still be required
for model convergence, particularly when FL workers have non-independent and
identically distributed (non-IID) data. Moreover, the FL workers are assumed to
fully cooperate in the FL training process, which may not always be true in
practical situations. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
synthetic-data-empowered HFL framework that mitigates the statistical issues
arising from non-IID local datasets while also incentivizing FL worker
participation. In our proposed framework, the edge servers reward the FL
workers in their clusters for facilitating the FL training process. To improve
the performance of the FL model given the non-IID local datasets of the FL
workers, the edge servers generate and distribute synthetic datasets to FL
workers within their clusters. FL workers determine which edge server to
associate with, considering the computational resources required to train on
both their local datasets and the synthetic datasets.

Result: 发现强线性化实现需要高协调能力，且竞赛对象比共识更弱，但仍能捕捉强线性化的限制。

Conclusion: 强线性化实现需要高协调能力，竞赛对象是研究强线性化限制的有效工具。

Abstract: This paper studies the relation between agreement and strongly linearizable
implementations of various objects. This leads to new results about
implementations of concurrent objects from various primitives including window
registers and interfering primitives. We consider implementations that provide
both strong linearizability and decisive linearizability.
  We identify that lock-free, respectively, wait-free, strongly linearizable
implementations of several concurrent objects entail a form of agreement that
is weaker than consensus but impossible to strongly-linearizable implement with
combinations of non-universal primitives. In both cases, lock-free and
wait-free, this form of agreement requires a distinguished process to referee a
competition that involves all other processes. Our results show that consistent
refereeing of such competitions (i.e. the outcome of the competition does not
change in extensions of the current execution) requires high coordination
power.
  More specifically, two contest objects are defined and used to capture the
power of strong linearizability in lock-free and wait-free implementations,
respectively. Both objects are strictly weaker than consensus, in the sense
that they have a wait-free linearizable (in fact, decisively linearizable)
implementation from reads and writes. The contest objects capture strong
linearizability since (1) they have strongly linearizable implementations from
several ``high-level'' objects like stacks, queues, snapshots, counters, and
therefore, impossibility results for them carry over to these objects, and (2)
they admit powerful impossibility results for strong linearizability that
involve window registers and interfering primitives, which are non-universal.

Motivation: 针对实时应用中SCD估计的高计算复杂度问题，研究旨在通过FPGA实现高效解决方案。

Method: 采用FFT累积方法（FAM）和条带谱相关分析器（SSCA），并在AMD Versal AI引擎上实现并行计算。

Result: 相比NVIDIA GPU，FAM和SSCA实现分别提速4.43倍/1.90倍，能效提升30.5倍/24.5倍。

Conclusion: FPGA实现显著提升了SCD估计的性能和能效，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Cyclostationary analysis is widely used in signal processing, particularly in
the analysis of human-made signals, and spectral correlation density (SCD) is
often used to characterise cyclostationarity. Unfortunately, for real-time
applications, even utilising the fast Fourier transform (FFT), the high
computational complexity associated with estimating the SCD limits its
applicability. In this work, we present optimised, high-speed
field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementations of two SCD estimation
techniques. Specifically, we present an implementation of the FFT accumulation
method (FAM) running entirely on the AMD Versal AI engine (AIE) array. We also
introduce an efficient implementation of the strip spectral correlation
analyser (SSCA) that can be used for window sizes up to $2^{20}$. For both
techniques, a generalised methodology is presented to parallelise the
computation while respecting memory size and data bandwidth constraints.
Compared to an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 graphics processing unit (GPU) which
uses a similar 7nm technology to our FPGA, for the same accuracy, our FAM/SSCA
implementations achieve speedups of 4.43x/1.90x and a 30.5x/24.5x improvement
in energy efficiency.

Abstract: Edge AI applications increasingly require models that can learn and adapt
on-device with minimal energy budget. Traditional deep learning models, while
powerful, are often overparameterized, energy-hungry, and dependent on cloud
connectivity. Brain-Like Neural Networks (BLNNs), such as the Bayesian
Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), propose a neuromorphic
alternative by mimicking cortical architecture and biologically-constrained
learning. They offer sparse architectures with local learning rules and
unsupervised/semi-supervised learning, making them well-suited for low-power
edge intelligence. However, existing BCPNN implementations rely on GPUs or
datacenter FPGAs, limiting their applicability to embedded systems. This work
presents the first embedded FPGA accelerator for BCPNN on a Zynq UltraScale+
SoC using High-Level Synthesis. We implement both online learning and
inference-only kernels with support for variable and mixed precision. Evaluated
on MNIST, Pneumonia, and Breast Cancer datasets, our accelerator achieves up to
17.5x latency and 94% energy savings over ARM baselines, without sacrificing
accuracy. This work enables practical neuromorphic computing on edge devices,
bridging the gap between brain-like learning and real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 机器学习在早期印刷书分析中具有潜力，但OCR和视觉内容解释仍需改进。

Abstract: We developed a proof-of-concept method for the automatic analysis of the
structure and content of incunabula pages. A custom dataset comprising 500
annotated pages from five different incunabula was created using resources from
the Jagiellonian Digital Library. Each page was manually labeled with five
predefined classes: Text, Title, Picture, Table, and Handwriting. Additionally,
the publicly available DocLayNet dataset was utilized as supplementary training
data. To perform object detection, YOLO11n and YOLO11s models were employed and
trained using two strategies: a combined dataset (DocLayNet and the custom
dataset) and the custom dataset alone. The highest performance (F1 = 0.94) was
achieved by the YOLO11n model trained exclusively on the custom data. Optical
character recognition was then conducted on regions classified as Text, using
both Tesseract and Kraken OCR, with Tesseract demonstrating superior results.
Subsequently, image classification was applied to the Picture class using a
ResNet18 model, achieving an accuracy of 98.7% across five subclasses:
Decorative_letter, Illustration, Other, Stamp, and Wrong_detection.
Furthermore, the CLIP model was utilized to generate semantic descriptions of
illustrations. The results confirm the potential of machine learning in the
analysis of early printed books, while emphasizing the need for further
advancements in OCR performance and visual content interpretation.

Conclusion: eCRT-Paillier算法和MESA架构有效提升了Paillier算法的解密效率和硬件性能，适用于隐私保护的云计算场景。

Abstract: To address the privacy protection problem in cloud computing, privacy
enhancement techniques such as the Paillier additive homomorphism algorithm are
receiving widespread attention. Paillier algorithm allows addition and scalar
multiplication operations in dencrypted state, which can effectively protect
privacy. However, its computational efficiency is limited by complex modulo
operations due to the ciphertext expansion followed by encryption. To
accelerate its decryption operation, the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) is
often used to optimize these modulo operations, which lengthens the decryption
computation chain in turn. To address this issue, we propose an eCRT-Paillier
decryption algorithm that shortens the decryption computation chain by
combining precomputed parameters and eliminating extra judgment operations
introduced by Montgomery modular multiplications. These two improvements reduce
50% modular multiplications and 60% judgment operations in the postprocessing
of the CRT-Paillier decryption algorithm. Based on these improvements, we
propose a highly parallel full-pipeline architecture to eliminate stalls caused
by multiplier reuse in traditional modular exponentiation operations. This
architecture also adopts some optimizations such as simplifying modular
exponentiation units by dividing the exponent into segments and parallelizing
data flow by multi-core instantiation. Finally, a high-throughput and efficient
Paillier accelerator named MESA was implemented on the Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA for
evaluation, which can complete a decryption using 2048-bit key within 0.577ms
under 100 MHz clock frequency. Compared to prior works, MESA demonstrates a
throughput improvement of 1.16 to 313.21 under identical conditions, also with
enhancements in area efficiency for LUT, DSP, and FF of 3.32 to 117.55, 1.49 to
1.64, and 2.94 to 9.94, respectively.

Abstract: The present dissertation addresses the problem of fairly distributing shared
resources in non-commercial blockchain networks. Blockchains are distributed
systems that order and timestamp records of a given network of users, in a
public, cryptographically secure, and consensual way. The records, which may in
kind be events, transaction orders, sets of rules for structured transactions
etc. are placed within well-defined datastructures called blocks, and they are
linked to each other by the virtue of cryptographic pointers, in a total
ordering which represents their temporal relations of succession. The ability
to operate on the blockchain, and/or to contribute a record to the content of a
block are shared resources of the blockchain systems. In commercial networks,
these resources are exchanged in return for fiat money, and consequently,
fairness is not a relevant problem in terms of computer engineering. In
non-commercial networks, however, monetary solutions are not available, by
definition. The present non-commercial blockchain networks employ trivial
distribution mechanisms called faucets, which offer fixed amounts of free
tokens (called cryptocurrencies) specific to the given network. This mechanism,
although simple and efficient, is prone to denial of service (DoS) attacks and
cannot address the fairness problem. In the present dissertation, the faucet
mechanism is adapted for fair distribution, in line with Max-min Fairness
scheme. In total, we contributed 6 distinct Max-min Fair algorithms as
efficient blockchain faucets. The algorithms we contribute are resistant to DoS
attacks, low-cost in terms of blockchain computation economics, and they also
allow for different user weighting policies.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A succinct histogram captures frequent items and their frequencies across
clients and has become increasingly important for large-scale,
privacy-sensitive machine learning applications. To develop a rigorous
framework to guarantee privacy for the succinct histogram problem, local
differential privacy (LDP) has been utilized and shown promising results. To
preserve data utility under LDP, which essentially works by intentionally
adding noise to data, error-correcting codes naturally emerge as a promising
tool for reliable information collection. This work presents the first
practical $(\epsilon,\delta)$-LDP protocol for constructing succinct histograms
using error-correcting codes. To this end, polar codes and their
successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding algorithms are leveraged as the
underlying coding scheme. More specifically, our protocol introduces
Gaussian-based perturbations to enable efficient soft decoding. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior methods, particularly for items
with low true frequencies, while maintaining similar frequency estimation
accuracy.

TL;DR: Weaver框架通过结合多个弱验证器，显著提升语言模型生成候选响应的选择准确性，减少对标记数据的依赖，并在数学和推理任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高质量的验证器要么不可扩展（如人类），要么实用性有限（如Lean工具），而语言模型验证器与完美验证器之间存在性能差距。

Method: Weaver通过加权集成多个弱验证器，利用弱监督估计验证器准确性，并统一输出分数。

Conclusion: Weaver框架有效缩小了验证器性能差距，同时通过训练小型交叉编码器降低计算成本。

Abstract: Verifiers can improve language model capabilities by scoring and ranking
responses from generated candidates. Currently, high-quality verifiers are
either unscalable (e.g., humans) or limited in utility (e.g., tools like Lean).
While LM judges and reward models have become broadly useful as general-purpose
verifiers, a significant performance gap remains between them and oracle
verifiers (verifiers with perfect accuracy). To help close this gap, we
introduce Weaver, a framework for designing a strong verifier by combining
multiple weak, imperfect verifiers. We find weighted ensembles of verifiers,
which typically require learning from labeled data, significantly outperform
unweighted combinations due to differences in verifier accuracies. To reduce
dependency on labeled data, Weaver leverages weak supervision to estimate each
verifier's accuracy and combines outputs into a unified score that better
reflects true response quality. However, directly applying weak supervision
algorithms poses challenges, including inconsistent verifier output formats and
handling low-quality verifiers. Weaver addresses these using dataset statistics
to normalize outputs and filter specific verifiers. We study Weaver's
effectiveness in test-time repeated sampling, where a model generates multiple
candidate responses and selects one. Our evaluations show Weaver significantly
improves over Pass@1-performance when selecting the first candidate-across
reasoning and math tasks, achieving o3-mini-level accuracy with Llama 3.3 70B
Instruct as generator, and an ensemble of 70B or smaller judge and reward
models as verifiers (87.7% average). This gain mirrors the jump between GPT-4o
and o3-mini (69.0% vs. 86.7%), which required extensive finetuning and
post-training. To reduce computational costs of verifier ensembles, we train a
400M cross-encoder using Weaver's combined output scores.

### [282] [Can Common VLMs Rival Medical VLMs? Evaluation and Strategic Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17337)
*Yuan Zhong,Ruinan Jin,Xiaoxiao Li,Qi Dou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 研究探讨通用视觉语言模型（VLMs）通过轻量级微调是否能匹敌专用医学VLMs，发现微调后通用模型在特定任务中表现相当或更优，且具有更强的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学VLMs需要大量计算和数据资源，而通用VLMs虽未经医学训练，但通过微调可能成为高效替代方案。

Method: 系统评估通用和医学VLMs在疾病诊断和视觉问答任务中的表现，比较微调前后的性能差距及泛化能力。

Result: 微调后的通用VLMs在特定任务中表现优于或匹配医学VLMs，且在未见过的医学模态任务中展现出强适应性。

Conclusion: 通用VLMs结合微调是一种可扩展且经济高效的替代方案，挑战了医学专用预训练的必要性。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) leverage large-scale pretraining for
diverse imaging tasks but require substantial computational and data resources.
Meanwhile, common or general-purpose VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA), though not
trained for medical use, show promise with fine-tuning. This raises a key
question: Can efficient fine-tuned common VLMs rival generalist medical VLMs
for solving specific medical imaging tasks? This study systematically evaluates
common and medical VLMs across disease diagnosis and visual question answering
(VQA). Using CLIP-based and LLaVA-based models, we examine (1) off-the-shelf
performance gaps in in-domain (ID) settings, (2) whether fine-tuning bridges
these gaps, and (3) generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) tasks on unseen
medical modalities. While medical-specific pretraining provides advantages in
ID settings, common VLMs match or surpass medical-specific models after
lightweight fine-tuning, with LoRA-based adaptation proving highly effective
among different tasks. In OOD tasks, common VLMs demonstrate strong
adaptability in some tasks, challenging the assumption that medical-specific
pre-training is essential. These findings suggest that leveraging common VLMs
with fine-tuning offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative to developing
large-scale medical VLMs, providing crucial insights for future research in the
medical imaging field.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于机器学习的框架，利用术中数字减影血管造影（DSA）序列和临床变量，预测急性缺血性卒中（AIS）患者血管内血栓切除术（EVT）后的无复流现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无复流现象会导致微血管低灌注，影响组织恢复和临床结果，但目前依赖术后24小时的灌注MRI，延迟了干预。

Method: 研究回顾性分析了UCLA医学中心的AIS患者数据，从DSA序列中提取统计和时间灌注特征，训练机器学习分类器预测无复流。

Result: 该方法显著优于基于临床特征的基线模型（AUC：0.7703 vs. 0.5728；准确率：0.8125 vs. 0.6331），证明DSA灌注动态能实时反映微血管完整性。

Conclusion: 该研究为无复流现象的即时准确预测奠定了基础，使临床医生能主动管理高风险患者，无需依赖延迟成像。

Abstract: Following successful large-vessel recanalization via endovascular
thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), some patients experience a
complication known as no-reflow, defined by persistent microvascular
hypoperfusion that undermines tissue recovery and worsens clinical outcomes.
Although prompt identification is crucial, standard clinical practice relies on
perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 24 hours post-procedure,
delaying intervention. In this work, we introduce the first-ever machine
learning (ML) framework to predict no-reflow immediately after EVT by
leveraging previously unexplored intra-procedural digital subtraction
angiography (DSA) sequences and clinical variables. Our retrospective analysis
included AIS patients treated at UCLA Medical Center (2011-2024) who achieved
favorable mTICI scores (2b-3) and underwent pre- and post-procedure MRI.
No-reflow was defined as persistent hypoperfusion (Tmax > 6 s) on
post-procedural imaging. From DSA sequences (AP and lateral views), we
extracted statistical and temporal perfusion features from the target
downstream territory to train ML classifiers for predicting no-reflow. Our
novel method significantly outperformed a clinical-features baseline(AUC:
0.7703 $\pm$ 0.12 vs. 0.5728 $\pm$ 0.12; accuracy: 0.8125 $\pm$ 0.10 vs. 0.6331
$\pm$ 0.09), demonstrating that real-time DSA perfusion dynamics encode
critical insights into microvascular integrity. This approach establishes a
foundation for immediate, accurate no-reflow prediction, enabling clinicians to
proactively manage high-risk patients without reliance on delayed imaging.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GAN的多波段红外图像彩色化方法，通过多阶段光谱自注意力Transformer网络（MTSIC）提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热红外图像缺乏颜色和纹理信息，现有方法因单波段限制导致图像失真和语义模糊。多波段红外图像提供更丰富的光谱数据，有助于提升彩色化效果。

Method: 采用GAN框架，生成器为MTSIC网络，结合空间-光谱注意力残差块（SARB）和多尺度小波块（MSWB），逐步优化重建质量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于传统技术，有效提升红外图像的视觉质量。

Conclusion: MTSIC框架通过多波段特征映射和语义对齐，解决了红外图像彩色化中的语义模糊问题，提升了图像质量。

Abstract: Thermal infrared (TIR) images, acquired through thermal radiation imaging,
are unaffected by variations in lighting conditions and atmospheric haze.
However, TIR images inherently lack color and texture information, limiting
downstream tasks and potentially causing visual fatigue. Existing colorization
methods primarily rely on single-band images with limited spectral information
and insufficient feature extraction capabilities, which often result in image
distortion and semantic ambiguity. In contrast, multiband infrared imagery
provides richer spectral data, facilitating the preservation of finer details
and enhancing semantic accuracy. In this paper, we propose a generative
adversarial network (GAN)-based framework designed to integrate spectral
information to enhance the colorization of infrared images. The framework
employs a multi-stage spectral self-attention Transformer network (MTSIC) as
the generator. Each spectral feature is treated as a token for self-attention
computation, and a multi-head self-attention mechanism forms a spatial-spectral
attention residual block (SARB), achieving multi-band feature mapping and
reducing semantic confusion. Multiple SARB units are integrated into a
Transformer-based single-stage network (STformer), which uses a U-shaped
architecture to extract contextual information, combined with multi-scale
wavelet blocks (MSWB) to align semantic information in the spatial-frequency
dual domain. Multiple STformer modules are cascaded to form MTSIC,
progressively optimizing the reconstruction quality. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional
techniques and effectively enhances the visual quality of infrared images.

TL;DR: LVPNet提出了一种基于预测的无损医学图像压缩方法，通过全局潜在变量预测像素值，并编码预测概率，解决了现有方法中潜在变量信息分布不均和后验崩溃的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像分割过程中导致潜在变量信息分布不均，引发后验崩溃和潜在变量利用效率低的问题。

Method: 提出LVPNet，引入全局多尺度感知模块（GMSM）提取紧凑的潜在表示，并提出量化补偿模块（QCM）减少量化误差。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，LVPNet的压缩效率优于现有无损图像压缩方法，同时保持推理速度。

Conclusion: LVPNet通过全局潜在变量和量化补偿，显著提升了无损医学图像压缩的性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive Initial Bits is a framework that integrates sub-image
autoregression and latent variable modeling, demonstrating its advantages in
lossless medical image compression. However, in existing methods, the image
segmentation process leads to an even distribution of latent variable
information across each sub-image, which in turn causes posterior collapse and
inefficient utilization of latent variables. To deal with these issues, we
propose a prediction-based end-to-end lossless medical image compression method
named LVPNet, leveraging global latent variables to predict pixel values and
encoding predicted probabilities for lossless compression. Specifically, we
introduce the Global Multi-scale Sensing Module (GMSM), which extracts compact
and informative latent representations from the entire image, effectively
capturing spatial dependencies within the latent space. Furthermore, to
mitigate the information loss introduced during quantization, we propose the
Quantization Compensation Module (QCM), which learns the distribution of
quantization errors and refines the quantized features to compensate for
quantization loss. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate
that our method achieves superior compression efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art lossless image compression approaches, while maintaining
competitive inference speed. The code is at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: M³Bind是一种新型预训练框架，通过共享文本表示空间实现多模态医学图像对齐，无需显式配对数据，在零样本、少样本分类和跨模态检索任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析需要整合多模态图像以获取互补信息，但现有方法需要显式配对数据，难以获取。

Method: M³Bind通过微调预训练的CLIP-like模型，对齐模态特定文本嵌入空间，并蒸馏为统一模型。

Result: 在X射线、CT等多种医学图像任务中，M³Bind表现优于CLIP-like模型。

Conclusion: M³Bind有效实现了跨模态医学图像对齐，为医学分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Medical image analysis increasingly relies on the integration of multiple
imaging modalities to capture complementary anatomical and functional
information, enabling more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Achieving
aligned feature representations across these diverse modalities is therefore
important for effective multimodal analysis. While contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) and its variant have enabled image-text alignments, they
require explicitly paired data between arbitrary two modalities, which is
difficult to acquire in medical contexts. To address the gap, we present
Multimodal Medical Image Binding with Text (M\textsuperscript{3}Bind), a novel
pre-training framework that enables seamless alignment of multiple medical
imaging modalities through a shared text representation space without requiring
explicit paired data between any two medical image modalities. Specifically,
based on the insight that different images can naturally bind with text,
M\textsuperscript{3}Bind first fine-tunes pre-trained CLIP-like image-text
models to align their modality-specific text embedding space while preserving
their original image-text alignments. Subsequently, we distill these
modality-specific text encoders into a unified model, creating a shared text
embedding space. Experiments on X-ray, CT, retina, ECG, and pathological images
on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that M\textsuperscript{3}Bind achieves
state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, few-shot classification and
cross-modal retrieval tasks compared to its CLIP-like counterparts. These
results validate M\textsuperscript{3}Bind's effectiveness in achieving
cross-image-modal alignment for medical analysis.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于深度学习的图像转换框架，用于从H&E染色组织样本生成高保真IHC图像，以低成本、可扩展的方式评估HER2状态。通过改进金字塔pix2pix的损失函数，解决了GAN中的模式崩溃问题，并引入了一种新的基于方差的惩罚机制，增强了生成图像的结构多样性。模型在HER2阳性（IHC 3+）图像的转换上表现尤为出色，并在多项指标上超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HER2阳性乳腺癌的诊断和治疗需要高精度的HER2评估，但传统的IHC技术成本高且依赖抗体选择，而H&E染色虽普及但缺乏特异性。本研究旨在通过AI技术提供一种更高效、可靠的替代方案。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI驱动的精准肿瘤学迈出了重要一步，提供了一种可靠且高效的HER2诊断替代方案，并展示了在多领域应用的潜力。

Abstract: The overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in
breast cells is a key driver of HER2-positive breast cancer, a highly
aggressive subtype requiring precise diagnosis and targeted therapy.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the standard technique for HER2 assessment but is
costly, labor-intensive, and highly dependent on antibody selection. In
contrast, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, a routine histopathological
procedure, offers broader accessibility but lacks HER2 specificity. This study
proposes an advanced deep learning-based image translation framework to
generate highfidelity IHC images from H&E-stained tissue samples, enabling
cost-effective and scalable HER2 assessment. By modifying the loss function of
pyramid pix2pix, we mitigate mode collapse, a fundamental limitation in
generative adversarial networks (GANs), and introduce a novel variance-based
penalty that enforces structural diversity in generated images. Our model
particularly excels in translating HER2-positive (IHC 3+) images, which have
remained challenging for existing methods due to their complex morphological
variations. Extensive evaluations on the BCI histopathological dataset
demonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of peak
signal-tonoise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and Frechet
Inception Distance (FID), particularly in accurately translating HER2-positive
(IHC 3+) images. Beyond medical imaging, our model exhibits superior
performance in general image-to-image translation tasks, showcasing its
potential across multiple domains. This work marks a significant step toward
AI-driven precision oncology, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to
traditional HER2 diagnostics.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in
cross-modal semantic understanding between visual and textual modalities. Given
the intrinsic need for multi-modal integration in clinical applications, VLMs
have emerged as a promising solution for a wide range of medical image analysis
tasks. However, adapting general-purpose VLMs to medical domain poses numerous
challenges, such as large domain gaps, complicated pathological variations, and
diversity and uniqueness of different tasks. The central purpose of this review
is to systematically summarize recent advances in adapting VLMs for medical
image analysis, analyzing current challenges, and recommending promising yet
urgent directions for further investigations. We begin by introducing core
learning strategies for medical VLMs, including pretraining, fine-tuning, and
prompt learning. We then categorize five major VLM adaptation strategies for
medical image analysis. These strategies are further analyzed across eleven
medical imaging tasks to illustrate their current practical implementations.
Furthermore, we analyze key challenges that impede the effective adaptation of
VLMs to clinical applications and discuss potential directions for future
research. We also provide an open-access repository of related literature to
facilitate further research, available at
https://github.com/haonenglin/Awesome-VLM-for-MIA. It is anticipated that this
article can help researchers who are interested in harnessing VLMs in medical
image analysis tasks have a better understanding on their capabilities and
limitations, as well as current technical barriers, to promote their
innovative, robust, and safe application in clinical practice.

Motivation: 视网膜血管分割因数据分布不平衡和血管厚度变化而具有挑战性，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 使用CNN架构和双层次类别平衡方案（Level-I平衡血管/非血管，Level-II平衡厚/薄血管），结合预处理技术（GCN、CLAHE、gamma校正）。

Result: 在标准数据集上表现优异（AUC 98.23%，准确率96.22%），并通过STARE数据集验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: BLCB-CNN是一种高效的视网膜血管分割方法，具有高精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Retinal fundus images provide valuable insights into the human eye's interior
structure and crucial features, such as blood vessels, optic disk, macula, and
fovea. However, accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels can be
challenging due to imbalanced data distribution and varying vessel thickness.
In this paper, we propose BLCB-CNN, a novel pipeline based on deep learning and
bi-level class balancing scheme to achieve vessel segmentation in retinal
fundus images. The BLCB-CNN scheme uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architecture and an empirical approach to balance the distribution of pixels
across vessel and non-vessel classes and within thin and thick vessels. Level-I
is used for vessel/non-vessel balancing and Level-II is used for thick/thin
vessel balancing. Additionally, pre-processing of the input retinal fundus
image is performed by Global Contrast Normalization (GCN), Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and gamma corrections to increase
intensity uniformity as well as to enhance the contrast between vessels and
background pixels. The resulting balanced dataset is used for
classification-based segmentation of the retinal vascular tree. We evaluate the
proposed scheme on standard retinal fundus images and achieve superior
performance measures, including an area under the ROC curve of 98.23%, Accuracy
of 96.22%, Sensitivity of 81.57%, and Specificity of 97.65%. We also
demonstrate the method's efficacy through external cross-validation on STARE
images, confirming its generalization ability.

Conclusion: TeNCA为合成对比增强提供了一种高效且生理学上合理的方法，有望推动乳腺MRI的广泛应用。

Abstract: Synthetic contrast enhancement offers fast image acquisition and eliminates
the need for intravenous injection of contrast agent. This is particularly
beneficial for breast imaging, where long acquisition times and high cost are
significantly limiting the applicability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as
a widespread screening modality. Recent studies have demonstrated the
feasibility of synthetic contrast generation. However, current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods lack sufficient measures for consistent temporal evolution.
Neural cellular automata (NCA) offer a robust and lightweight architecture to
model evolving patterns between neighboring cells or pixels. In this work we
introduce TeNCA (Temporal Neural Cellular Automata), which extends and further
refines NCAs to effectively model temporally sparse, non-uniformly sampled
imaging data. To achieve this, we advance the training strategy by enabling
adaptive loss computation and define the iterative nature of the method to
resemble a physical progression in time. This conditions the model to learn a
physiologically plausible evolution of contrast enhancement. We rigorously
train and test TeNCA on a diverse breast MRI dataset and demonstrate its
effectiveness, surpassing the performance of existing methods in generation of
images that align with ground truth post-contrast sequences.

Abstract: Accurate geological modeling is critical for reservoir characterization, yet
traditional methods struggle with complex subsurface heterogeneity, and they
have problems with conditioning to observed data. This study introduces
Pix2Geomodel, a novel conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)
framework based on Pix2Pix, designed to predict reservoir properties (facies,
porosity, permeability, and water saturation) from the Rotliegend reservoir of
the Groningen gas field. Utilizing a 7.6 million-cell dataset from the
Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, accessed via EPOS-NL, the methodology
included data preprocessing, augmentation to generate 2,350 images per
property, and training with a U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator over
19,000 steps. Evaluation metrics include pixel accuracy (PA), mean intersection
over union (mIoU), frequency weighted intersection over union (FWIoU), and
visualizations assessed performance in masked property prediction and
property-to-property translation tasks. Results demonstrated high accuracy for
facies (PA 0.88, FWIoU 0.85) and water saturation (PA 0.96, FWIoU 0.95), with
moderate success for porosity (PA 0.70, FWIoU 0.55) and permeability (PA 0.74,
FWIoU 0.60), and robust translation performance (e.g., facies-to-facies PA
0.98, FWIoU 0.97). The framework captured spatial variability and geological
realism, as validated by variogram analysis, and calculated the training loss
curves for the generator and discriminator for each property. Compared to
traditional methods, Pix2Geomodel offers enhanced fidelity in direct property
mapping. Limitations include challenges with microstructural variability and 2D
constraints, suggesting future integration of multi-modal data and 3D modeling
(Pix2Geomodel v2.0). This study advances the application of generative AI in
geoscience, supporting improved reservoir management and open science
initiatives.

Motivation: 量子乘法器在量子算法中广泛应用，但现有方法存在高Toffoli深度和T门使用量的问题，限制了其可扩展性和实用性。

Method: 采用余数系统（RNS）的分布式量子乘法，设计量子Diminished-1模$(2^n+1)$乘法器，降低资源消耗。

Conclusion: 基于RNS的分布式量子乘法方法显著降低了资源消耗，提升了量子乘法器的可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Multiplication of quantum states is a frequently used function or subroutine
in quantum algorithms and applications, making quantum multipliers an essential
component of quantum arithmetic. However, quantum multiplier circuits suffer
from high Toffoli depth and T gate usage, which ultimately affects their
scalability and applicability on quantum computers. To address these issues, we
propose utilizing the Residue Number System (RNS) based distributed quantum
multiplication, which executes multiple quantum modulo multiplication circuits
across quantum computers or jobs with lower Toffoli depth and T gate usage.
Towards this end, we propose a design of Quantum Diminished-1 Modulo $(2^n+1)$

TL;DR: AISLE是一个自主互联的科学实验室生态系统，旨在通过跨机构协作和AI驱动的方法加速科学发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自主实验室孤立运行，无法跨机构协作，限制了科学发现的效率。AISLE致力于解决这一问题，将分散的能力整合为统一系统。

Method: AISLE通过五个关键维度实现目标：跨机构设备协调、FAIR合规的智能数据管理、基于科学原理的AI代理驱动协调、可互操作的代理通信接口，以及AI/ML集成的科学教育。

Result: AISLE能够缩短从构想到创新的路径，将发现时间从几十年缩短到几个月，并解锁传统方法无法触及的研究领域。

Conclusion: AISLE的协作自主科学模式有望在可持续能源、材料开发和公共健康等领域带来突破性进展。

Abstract: Scientific discovery is being revolutionized by AI and autonomous systems,
yet current autonomous laboratories remain isolated islands unable to
collaborate across institutions. We present the Autonomous Interconnected
Science Lab Ecosystem (AISLE), a grassroots network transforming fragmented
capabilities into a unified system that shorten the path from ideation to
innovation to impact and accelerates discovery from decades to months. AISLE
addresses five critical dimensions: (1) cross-institutional equipment
orchestration, (2) intelligent data management with FAIR compliance, (3)
AI-agent driven orchestration grounded in scientific principles, (4)
interoperable agent communication interfaces, and (5) AI/ML-integrated
scientific education. By connecting autonomous agents across institutional
boundaries, autonomous science can unlock research spaces inaccessible to
traditional approaches while democratizing cutting-edge technologies. This
paradigm shift toward collaborative autonomous science promises breakthroughs
in sustainable energy, materials development, and public health.

*I. Loaiza,R. Vestrelli,A. Fronzetti Colladon,R. Rigobon*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究发现六种流行的大型语言模型（LLMs）在评估180个国家的新闻自由时存在系统性偏差，包括负面偏差、差异偏差和本土偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在全球信息获取中的作用日益重要，其偏差可能影响公众对民主制度的理解和信任。

Method: 比较六种LLMs对新闻自由的评估与世界新闻自由指数（WPFI）的专家评估。

Result: LLMs普遍低估新闻自由，差异偏差显示对新闻自由较高的国家低估更严重，且多数模型对本国存在正面偏见。

Conclusion: LLMs需确保准确反映全球人权和公民权利，以避免误导公众。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly mediate global information
access for millions of users worldwide, their alignment and biases have the
potential to shape public understanding and trust in fundamental democratic
institutions, such as press freedom. In this study, we uncover three systematic
distortions in the way six popular LLMs evaluate press freedom in 180 countries
compared to expert assessments of the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI). The six
LLMs exhibit a negative misalignment, consistently underestimating press
freedom, with individual models rating between 71% to 93% of countries as less
free. We also identify a paradoxical pattern we term differential misalignment:
LLMs disproportionately underestimate press freedom in countries where it is
strongest. Additionally, five of the six LLMs exhibit positive home bias,
rating their home countries' press freedoms more favorably than would be
expected given their negative misalignment with the human benchmark. In some
cases, LLMs rate their home countries between 7% to 260% more positively than
expected. If LLMs are set to become the next search engines and some of the
most important cultural tools of our time, they must ensure accurate
representations of the state of our human and civic rights globally.

TL;DR: MAARTA是一个多智能体框架，通过分析视线模式和放射学报告提供个性化反馈，帮助学生改进视觉搜索和诊断推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学学生因缺乏专家指导时间，常出现视觉搜索和诊断解释错误，现有AI系统未能有效解决这些感知错误。

Method: MAARTA通过动态选择智能体分析视线行为差异，使用结构化图表比较专家与学生行为，并分配感知错误教师智能体逐步指导学生。

Result: 系统能识别遗漏发现并分析差异，帮助学生理解错误，提升诊断推理能力。

Conclusion: MAARTA推动了AI驱动的放射学教育，提供了一种自适应且高效的教学方法。

Abstract: Radiology students often struggle to develop perceptual expertise due to
limited expert mentorship time, leading to errors in visual search and
diagnostic interpretation. These perceptual errors, such as missed fixations,
short dwell times, or misinterpretations, are not adequately addressed by
current AI systems, which focus on diagnostic accuracy but fail to explain how
and why errors occur. To address this gap, we introduce MAARTA (Multi-Agentic
Adaptive Radiology Teaching Assistant), a multi-agent framework that analyzes
gaze patterns and radiology reports to provide personalized feedback. Unlike
single-agent models, MAARTA dynamically selects agents based on error
complexity, enabling adaptive and efficient reasoning. By comparing expert and
student gaze behavior through structured graphs, the system identifies missed
findings and assigns Perceptual Error Teacher agents to analyze discrepancies.
MAARTA then uses step-by-step prompting to help students understand their
errors and improve diagnostic reasoning, advancing AI-driven radiology
education.

TL;DR: 研究利用多模态生物特征检测在线学习中因使用智能手机导致的注意力分散，提出一种结合生理信号和头部姿态数据的AI方法，多模态模型准确率达91%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习中，学习者面临内部、系统和上下文因素的干扰，传统平台缺乏详细行为数据，需要新方法监测注意力。

Method: 提出基于AI的方法，结合生理信号（如脑电波、心率）和头部姿态数据，检测智能手机使用。

Result: 单一生理信号准确率有限，头部姿态数据达87%；多模态模型整合所有信号后准确率提升至91%。

Conclusion: 多模态模型在在线学习环境中具有潜力，但需考虑实时部署的局限性和挑战。

Abstract: This work investigates the use of multimodal biometrics to detect
distractions caused by smartphone use during tasks that require sustained
attention, with a focus on computer-based online learning. Although the methods
are applicable to various domains, such as autonomous driving, we concentrate
on the challenges learners face in maintaining engagement amid internal (e.g.,
motivation), system-related (e.g., course design) and contextual (e.g.,
smartphone use) factors. Traditional learning platforms often lack detailed
behavioral data, but Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) and biosensors
provide new insights into learner attention. We propose an AI-based approach
that leverages physiological signals and head pose data to detect phone use.
Our results show that single biometric signals, such as brain waves or heart
rate, offer limited accuracy, while head pose alone achieves 87%. A multimodal
model combining all signals reaches 91% accuracy, highlighting the benefits of
integration. We conclude by discussing the implications and limitations of
deploying these models for real-time support in online learning environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合文本和图像去偏见的模型，通过四个步骤实现：图像文本对齐、图像偏见评分、文本去偏见和最终的去偏见替换。初步结果显示该方法有效，但仍需更多资源和时间优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政治回音室现象使得从政治文章中去掉主观偏见和情绪化语言变得重要。现有研究仅关注文本偏见，忽略了图像作为信息媒介的同等重要性。

Method: 模型包括四个步骤：1) 使用CLIP模型对齐图像语义；2) 通过ViT分类器评分图像偏见；3) 用BERT模型检测并中和文本偏见；4) 替换为去偏见的文本和图像。

Result: 文本去偏见策略能有效识别偏见词，ViT模型训练效果良好，语义对齐模型高效。但需更多资源和时间优化。

Conclusion: 该方法初步有效，未来需更多训练和资源提升效果，并计划加入人工评估确保语义一致性。

Abstract: Due to the presence of political echo chambers, it becomes imperative to
detect and remove subjective bias and emotionally charged language from both
the text and images of political articles. However, prior work has focused on
solely the text portion of the bias rather than both the text and image
portions. This is a problem because the images are just as powerful of a medium
to communicate information as text is. To that end, we present a model that
leverages both text and image bias which consists of four different steps.
Image Text Alignment focuses on semantically aligning images based on their
bias through CLIP models. Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias
score of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting
biased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models. These three
steps all culminate to the final step of debiasing, which replaces the text and
the image with neutralized or reduced counterparts, which for images is done by
comparing the bias scores. The results so far indicate that this approach is
promising, with the text debiasing strategy being able to identify many
potential biased words and phrases, and the ViT model showcasing effective
training. The semantic alignment model also is efficient. However, more time,
particularly in training, and resources are needed to obtain better results. A
human evaluation portion was also proposed to ensure semantic consistency of
the newly generated text and images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 噪声原语模型中的几何算法研究主要集中在顺序算法上，缺乏并行算法的探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，研究并行算法在噪声环境下的表现。

Method: 采用CREW PRAM模型，提出了一种基于失败扫描技术的错误检测与修复方法，用于优化2D和3D凸包的计算。

Result: 首次在噪声原语模型中实现了2D和3D凸包的最优并行算法。

Conclusion: 本文证明了在噪声环境下并行算法的可行性，并通过技术改进提升了算法的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: In the noisy primitives model, each primitive comparison performed by an
algorithm, e.g., testing whether one value is greater than another, returns the
incorrect answer with random, independent probability p < 1/2 and otherwise
returns a correct answer. This model was first applied in the context of
sorting and searching, and recent work by Eppstein, Goodrich, and Sridhar
extends this model to sequential algorithms involving geometric primitives such
as orientation and sidedness tests. However, their approaches appear to be
inherently sequential; hence, in this paper, we study parallel computational
geometry algorithms for 2D and 3D convex hulls in the noisy primitives model.
We give the first optimal parallel algorithms in the noisy primitives model for
2D and 3D convex hulls in the CREW PRAM model. The main technical contribution
of our work concerns our ability to detect and fix errors during intermediate
steps of our algorithm using a generalization of the failure sweeping
technique.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在完全动态设置下维护单链接树状图（SLD）的问题，提出了比静态算法更快的动态更新算法，并提供了并行和批量并行版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单链接层次聚类（HAC）在动态数据场景下的维护问题尚未被充分研究，尤其是如何高效更新SLD。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 假设输入是一个动态森林（表示数据的最小生成森林），提出了一系列动态更新算法，包括插入和删除操作，并扩展到并行和批量并行版本。

Result: 提出的算法在时间复杂度和并行效率上优于静态算法，特别是在树状图高度较低时表现更优。

Conclusion: 本文为动态数据下的单链接聚类提供了高效的更新算法，为实际应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Single-linkage clustering is a popular form of hierarchical agglomerative
clustering (HAC) where the distance between two clusters is defined as the
minimum distance between any pair of points across the two clusters. In
single-linkage HAC, the output is typically the single-linkage dendrogram
(SLD), which is the binary tree representing the hierarchy of clusters formed
by iteratively contracting the two closest clusters. In the dynamic setting,
prior work has only studied maintaining a minimum spanning forest over the data
since single-linkage HAC reduces to computing the SLD on the minimum spanning
forest of the data.
  In this paper, we study the problem of maintaining the SLD in the
fully-dynamic setting. We assume the input is a dynamic forest $F$
(representing the minimum spanning forest of the data) which receives a
sequence of edge insertions and edge deletions. To our knowledge, no prior work
has provided algorithms to update an SLD asymptotically faster than recomputing
it from scratch. All of our update algorithms are asymptotically faster than
the best known static SLD computation algorithm, which takes $O(n \log h)$ time
where $h$ is the height of the dendrogram ($h \leq n-1$). Furthermore, our
algorithms are much faster in many cases, such as when $h$ is low. Our first
set of results are an insertion algorithm in $O(h)$ time and a deletion
algorithm in $O(h \log (1+n/h))$ time. Next, we describe parallel and
batch-parallel versions of these algorithms which are work-efficient or nearly
work-efficient and have poly-logarithmic depth. Finally, we show how to perform
insertions near-optimally in $O(c \log(1+n/c))$ time, where $c$ is the number
of structural changes in the dendrogram caused by the update, and give a
work-efficient parallel version of this algorithm that has polylogarithmic
depth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个高性能、硬件无关的库，支持多相流动模拟，并集成机器学习工作流。

Method: 利用JAX进行计算，采用Shan-Chen伪势方法建模多相相互作用，结合改进的虚拟密度方案处理润湿现象。

Result: 验证了库的准确性（如Laplace定律、毛细上升等），并展示了单/多GPU性能扩展。

Conclusion: JAX-LaB是一个开源库，适用于复杂多相流动模拟，性能优越且易于集成。

Abstract: We present JAX-LaB, a differentiable, Python-based Lattice Boltzmann library
for simulating multiphase and multiphysics flows in hydrologic, geologic, and
engineered porous media. Built as an extension of the XLB library, JAX-LaB
utilizes JAX for computations and offers a performant, hardware-agnostic
implementation that integrates seamlessly with machine learning workflows and
scales efficiently across CPUs, GPUs, and distributed systems. Multiphase
interactions are modeled using the Shan-Chen pseudopotential method, which is
coupled with an equation of state and an improved forcing scheme to obtain
liquid-vapor densities that are consistent with Maxwell's construction,
enabling simulations of systems with very large density ratios while
maintaining minimal spurious currents. Wetting is handled using the "improved"
virtual density scheme, which allows precise control of contact angles and
eliminates non-physical films seen in other Shan-Chen wetting methods. We
validate the library through several analytical benchmarks, such as Laplace's
law, capillary rise, and cocurrent multicomponent flow, and demonstrate some
exemplary use cases for the library. We also report single- and multi-GPU
performance scaling of the library. The library is open-source under the Apache
license and available at https://github.com/piyush-ppradhan/JAX-LaB.

Motivation: 传统FS-KWS系统在资源受限的边缘环境中表现不佳，特别是在低误报率下准确率较低。

Method: 利用Wav2Vec 2.0作为教师模型，结合Sub-center ArcFace损失函数增强特征提取，并通过注意力降维和轻量级ResNet15学生模型实现高效部署。

Result: 在GSC数据集上，10-shot分类准确率从33.4%提升至74.1%（1%误报率）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了FS-KWS在真实场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Keyword Spotting plays a critical role in enabling hands-free interaction for
battery-powered edge devices. Few-Shot Keyword Spotting (FS-KWS) addresses the
scalability and adaptability challenges of traditional systems by enabling
recognition of custom keywords with only a few examples. However, existing
FS-KWS systems achieve subpar accuracy at desirable false acceptance rates,
particularly in resource-constrained edge environments. To address these
issues, we propose a training scheme that leverages self-supervised learning
models for robust feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and knowledge
distillation. The teacher model, based on Wav2Vec 2.0 is trained using
Sub-center ArcFace loss, which enhances inter-class separability and
intra-class compactness. To enable efficient deployment on edge devices, we
introduce attention-based dimensionality reduction and train a standard
lightweight ResNet15 student model. We evaluate the proposed approach on the
English portion of the Multilingual Spoken Words Corpus (MSWC) and the Google
Speech Commands (GSC) datasets. Notably, the proposed training method improves
the 10-shot classification accuracy from 33.4% to 74.1% on 11 classes at 1%
false alarm accuracy on the GSC dataset, thus making it significantly
better-suited for a real use case scenario.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 浮点数据在多个领域广泛应用，其无损存储对精度至关重要，但现有方法未能充分利用数据中的模式。

Method: 提出DTT方法，通过将相关字节分组以利用浮点数据中的相关性，提升压缩效率。

Result: 在多种数据集上测试，DTT的几何平均压缩比提升1.16倍，压缩和解压吞吐量提升1.18-3.79倍。

Conclusion: DTT方法显著提升了浮点数据的压缩效率和性能，优于现有工具。

Abstract: Floating-point data is widely used across various domains. Depending on the
required precision, each floating-point value can occupy several bytes.
Lossless storage of this information is crucial due to its critical accuracy,
as seen in applications such as medical imaging and language model weights. In
these cases, data size is often significant, making lossless compression
essential. Previous approaches either treat this data as raw byte streams for
compression or fail to leverage all patterns within the dataset. However,
because multiple bytes represent a single value and due to inherent patterns in
floating-point representations, some of these bytes are correlated. To leverage
this property, we propose a novel data transformation method called Typed Data
Transformation (\DTT{}) that groups related bytes together to improve
compression. We implemented and tested our approach on various datasets across
both CPU and GPU. \DTT{} achieves a geometric mean compression ratio
improvement of 1.16$\times$ over state-of-the-art compression tools such as
zstd, while also improving both compression and decompression throughput by
1.18--3.79$\times$.

Method: 提供10米分辨率的全球海岸数据集，精度提升100倍以上；开发了名为Lighthouse的新库，用于高效查询。

Result: Lighthouse在资源受限环境下表现优异，仅需1 CPU和2 GB RAM即可实现毫秒级在线推理。

Abstract: We introduce a new dataset and algorithm for fast and efficient coastal
distance calculations from Anywhere on Earth (AoE). Existing global coastal
datasets are only available at coarse resolution (e.g. 1-4 km) which limits
their utility. Publicly available satellite imagery combined with computer
vision enable much higher precision. We provide a global coastline dataset at
10 meter resolution, a 100+ fold improvement in precision over existing data.
To handle the computational challenge of querying at such an increased scale,
we introduce a new library: Layered Iterative Geospatial Hierarchical
Terrain-Oriented Unified Search Engine (Lighthouse). Lighthouse is both
exceptionally fast and resource-efficient, requiring only 1 CPU and 2 GB of RAM
to achieve millisecond online inference, making it well suited for real-time

Motivation: 现有数据增强方法在同时应对数据损坏和对抗攻击时仍有改进空间，需提升模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DRO-Augment框架，整合W-DRO与多种数据增强策略，并通过变分正则化损失函数优化模型。

Conclusion: DRO-Augment有效提升模型鲁棒性，理论分析还提供了新的泛化误差界。

Abstract: In many real-world applications, ensuring the robustness and stability of
deep neural networks (DNNs) is crucial, particularly for image classification
tasks that encounter various input perturbations. While data augmentation
techniques have been widely adopted to enhance the resilience of a trained
model against such perturbations, there remains significant room for
improvement in robustness against corrupted data and adversarial attacks
simultaneously. To address this challenge, we introduce DRO-Augment, a novel
framework that integrates Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization
(W-DRO) with various data augmentation strategies to improve the robustness of
the models significantly across a broad spectrum of corruptions. Our method
outperforms existing augmentation methods under severe data perturbations and
adversarial attack scenarios while maintaining the accuracy on the clean
datasets on a range of benchmark datasets, including but not limited to
CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST. On the theoretical side, we
establish novel generalization error bounds for neural networks trained using a
computationally efficient, variation-regularized loss function closely related
to the W-DRO problem.

TL;DR: SlimRAG是一个轻量级的检索增强生成框架，通过实体感知机制替代传统图结构，提高了检索效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的RAG系统存在结构开销大和检索不精确的问题，语义相似性不等于语义相关性。

Method: SlimRAG构建实体到块的紧凑表，查询时识别关键实体并检索相关块，避免图遍历。

Result: 实验表明，SlimRAG在多个QA基准测试中优于基线，同时减少了索引大小和RITU。

Conclusion: SlimRAG证明了无结构、以实体为中心的检索方法的有效性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by
incorporating external knowledge at inference time. However, graph-based RAG
systems often suffer from structural overhead and imprecise retrieval: they
require costly pipelines for entity linking and relation extraction, yet
frequently return subgraphs filled with loosely related or tangential content.
This stems from a fundamental flaw -- semantic similarity does not imply
semantic relevance. We introduce SlimRAG, a lightweight framework for retrieval
without graphs. SlimRAG replaces structure-heavy components with a simple yet
effective entity-aware mechanism. At indexing time, it constructs a compact
entity-to-chunk table based on semantic embeddings. At query time, it
identifies salient entities, retrieves and scores associated chunks, and
assembles a concise, contextually relevant input -- without graph traversal or
edge construction. To quantify retrieval efficiency, we propose Relative Index
Token Utilization (RITU), a metric measuring the compactness of retrieved
content. Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks show that SlimRAG
outperforms strong flat and graph-based baselines in accuracy while reducing
index size and RITU (e.g., 16.31 vs. 56+), highlighting the value of
structure-free, entity-centric context selection. The code will be released
soon. https://github.com/continue-ai-company/SlimRAG

Abstract: In recent years, with the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous
publications relevant to this disease have been issued. Because of the massive

researchers with useful information if an unexpected pandemic happens so
suddenly, like COVID-19. In this work, we present a method to help the
retrieval system, the Covrelex-SE system, to provide more high-quality search
results. We exploited the power of the large language models (LLMs) to extract
the hidden relationships inside the unlabeled publication that cannot be found
by the current parsing tools that the system is using. Since then, help the

Abstract: The Citation Discovery Shared Task focuses on predicting the correct citation
from a given candidate pool for a given paragraph. The main challenges stem
from the length of the abstract paragraphs and the high similarity among
candidate abstracts, making it difficult to determine the exact paper to cite.
To address this, we develop a system that first retrieves the top-k most
similar abstracts based on extracted relational features from the given
paragraph. From this subset, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to
accurately identify the most relevant citation. We evaluate our framework on
the training dataset provided by the SCIDOCA 2025 organizers, demonstrating its
effectiveness in citation prediction.

Conclusion: LLM-EMF通过多模态数据融合显著提升了跨域序列推荐的性能。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) predicts user behavior by
leveraging historical interactions across multiple domains, focusing on
modeling cross-domain preferences and capturing both intra- and inter-sequence
item relationships. We propose LLM-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion for Cross-Domain
Sequential Recommendation (LLM-EMF), a novel and advanced approach that
enhances textual information with Large Language Models (LLM) knowledge and
significantly improves recommendation performance through the fusion of visual
and textual data. Using the frozen CLIP model, we generate image and text
embeddings, thereby enriching item representations with multimodal data. A
multiple attention mechanism jointly learns both single-domain and cross-domain
preferences, effectively capturing and understanding complex user interests
across diverse domains. Evaluations conducted on four e-commerce datasets
demonstrate that LLM-EMF consistently outperforms existing methods in modeling
cross-domain user preferences, thereby highlighting the effectiveness of
multimodal data integration and its advantages in enhancing sequential
recommendation systems. Our source code will be released.

*Aniss Bessalah,Hatem Mohamed Abdelmoumen,Karima Benatchba,Hadjer Benmeziane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文介绍了AnalogNAS-Bench，这是首个专为模拟内存计算（AIMC）设计的神经架构搜索（NAS）基准，揭示了当前NAS方法在AIMC中的局限性，并提出了优化方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经网络未针对AIMC的非理想特性设计，需要专门的NAS基准来优化AIMC架构。

Method: 提出AnalogNAS-Bench基准，分析AIMC特有的噪声和架构特性。

Result: 发现标准量化技术无法捕捉AIMC噪声，稳健架构倾向于更宽和分支结构，跳跃连接增强对时间漂移噪声的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AnalogNAS-Bench填补了AIMC专用NAS基准的空白，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Analog In-memory Computing (AIMC) has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm
for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), offering significant energy and
latency benefits over conventional digital hardware. However, state-of-the-art
neural networks are not inherently designed for AIMC, as they fail to account
for its unique non-idealities. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is thus needed
to systematically discover neural architectures optimized explicitly for AIMC
constraints. However, comparing NAS methodologies and extracting insights about
robust architectures for AIMC requires a dedicated NAS benchmark that
explicitly accounts for AIMC-specific hardware non-idealities. To address this,
we introduce AnalogNAS-Bench, the first NAS benchmark tailored specifically for
AIMC. Our study reveals three key insights: (1) standard quantization
techniques fail to capture AIMC-specific noises, (2) robust architectures tend
to feature wider and branched blocks, (3) skip connections improve resilience
to temporal drift noise. These insights highlight the limitations of current
NAS benchmarks for AIMC and pave the way for future analog-aware NAS. All the
implementations used in this paper can be found at

*Jianhang Xie,Chuntao Ding,Xiaqing Li,Shenyuan Ren,Yidong Li,Zhichao Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为NestQuant的资源友好型后训练整数嵌套量化方法，用于在物联网设备上实现量化模型的动态切换，解决了现有后训练量化方法在资源适应性和存储开销方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动态/混合精度量化方法需要重新训练或特殊硬件支持，而后训练量化（PTQ）方法在资源适应性方面存在局限性，无法适应物联网设备的动态资源需求，且部署多比特宽模型会带来高存储和切换开销。

Method: NestQuant通过整数权重分解和嵌套机制，将量化权重按比特分解为高低比特权重，并通过自适应舍入优化高比特权重，将其嵌套到原始量化权重中。部署时只需存储和传输一个模型，通过分页切换低比特权重以适应资源变化。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K预训练的DNN上进行实验，NestQuant模型在准确率上表现优异，同时显著减少了数据传输、存储消耗和切换开销。例如，ResNet-101在INT8嵌套INT6时，全比特和部分比特模型的准确率分别为78.1%和77.9%，切换开销降低了约78.1%。

Conclusion: NestQuant是一种高效的后训练量化方法，能够在保持高准确率的同时，显著降低资源消耗和切换开销，适用于物联网设备的动态资源环境。

Abstract: Deploying quantized deep neural network (DNN) models with resource adaptation
capabilities on ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices to provide
high-quality AI services can leverage the benefits of compression and meet
multi-scenario resource requirements. However, existing dynamic/mixed precision
quantization requires retraining or special hardware, whereas post-training
quantization (PTQ) has two limitations for resource adaptation: (i) The
state-of-the-art PTQ methods only provide one fixed bitwidth model, which makes
it challenging to adapt to the dynamic resources of IoT devices; (ii) Deploying
multiple PTQ models with diverse bitwidths consumes large storage resources and
switching overheads. To this end, this paper introduces a resource-friendly
post-training integer-nesting quantization, i.e., NestQuant, for on-device
quantized model switching on IoT devices. The proposed NestQuant incorporates
the integer weight decomposition, which bit-wise splits quantized weights into
higher-bit and lower-bit weights of integer data types. It also contains a
decomposed weights nesting mechanism to optimize the higher-bit weights by
adaptive rounding and nest them into the original quantized weights. In
deployment, we can send and store only one NestQuant model and switch between
the full-bit/part-bit model by paging in/out lower-bit weights to adapt to
resource changes and reduce consumption. Experimental results on the
ImageNet-1K pretrained DNNs demonstrated that the NestQuant model can achieve
high performance in top-1 accuracy, and reduce in terms of data transmission,
storage consumption, and switching overheads. In particular, the ResNet-101
with INT8 nesting INT6 can achieve 78.1% and 77.9% accuracy for full-bit and
part-bit models, respectively, and reduce switching overheads by approximately
78.1% compared with diverse bitwidths PTQ models.

Conclusion: DeInfoReg为梯度流分解和并行训练提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces Decoupled Supervised Learning with Information
Regularization (DeInfoReg), a novel approach that transforms a long gradient
flow into multiple shorter ones, thereby mitigating the vanishing gradient
problem. Integrating a pipeline strategy, DeInfoReg enables model
parallelization across multiple GPUs, significantly improving training
throughput. We compare our proposed method with standard backpropagation and
other gradient flow decomposition techniques. Extensive experiments on diverse
tasks and datasets demonstrate that DeInfoReg achieves superior performance and
better noise resistance than traditional BP models and efficiently utilizes
parallel computing resources. The code for reproducibility is available at:

TL;DR: FaithfulSAE通过使用模型自身生成的数据训练稀疏自编码器（SAE），解决了传统SAE因外部数据训练导致的特征不稳定和虚假特征问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SAE在外部数据集上训练时，可能因数据分布不匹配导致特征不稳定和虚假特征，影响模型内部特征的可解释性。

Method: 提出FaithfulSAE方法，利用模型自身生成的合成数据集训练SAE，减少数据分布不匹配问题。

Result: FaithfulSAE在多个模型中表现更稳定，虚假特征比例更低，并在SAE探测任务中优于基于网络数据训练的SAE。

Conclusion: FaithfulSAE通过消除对外部数据集的依赖，提升了模型内部特征的可解释性，并强调了SAE训练数据集的重要性。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising solution for
decomposing large language model representations into interpretable features.
However, Paulo and Belrose (2025) have highlighted instability across different
initialization seeds, and Heap et al. (2025) have pointed out that SAEs may not
capture model-internal features. These problems likely stem from training SAEs
on external datasets - either collected from the Web or generated by another
model - which may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) data beyond the model's
generalisation capabilities. This can result in hallucinated SAE features,
which we term "Fake Features", that misrepresent the model's internal
activations. To address these issues, we propose FaithfulSAE, a method that
trains SAEs on the model's own synthetic dataset. Using FaithfulSAEs, we
demonstrate that training SAEs on less-OOD instruction datasets results in SAEs
being more stable across seeds. Notably, FaithfulSAEs outperform SAEs trained
on web-based datasets in the SAE probing task and exhibit a lower Fake Feature
Ratio in 5 out of 7 models. Overall, our approach eliminates the dependency on
external datasets, advancing interpretability by better capturing
model-internal features while highlighting the often neglected importance of
SAE training datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MoTE的Transformer块，通过任务感知对比学习提升低容量模型的嵌入性能，无需改变指令或训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令调节方法在低容量模型中存在表示限制，限制了性能提升。

Method: 引入Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE)块，结合Task-Aware Contrastive Learning (TACL)训练任务专用参数。

Result: MoTE在检索数据集上性能提升64%，所有数据集上提升43%，且不改变指令或训练数据。

Conclusion: MoTE有效解决了低容量模型的嵌入性能限制，为任务专用嵌入提供了新方法。

Abstract: Dense embeddings are fundamental to modern machine learning systems, powering
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), information retrieval, and representation
learning. While instruction-conditioning has become the dominant approach for
embedding specialization, its direct application to low-capacity models imposes
fundamental representational constraints that limit the performance gains
derived from specialization. In this paper, we analyze these limitations and
introduce the Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE) transformer block, which leverages
task-specialized parameters trained with Task-Aware Contrastive Learning
(\tacl) to enhance the model ability to generate specialized embeddings.
Empirical results show that MoTE achieves $64\%$ higher performance gains in
retrieval datasets ($+3.27 \rightarrow +5.21$) and $43\%$ higher performance
gains across all datasets ($+1.81 \rightarrow +2.60$). Critically, these gains
are achieved without altering instructions, training data, inference time, or
number of active parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IRO的方法，通过强化学习框架在不更新模型参数的情况下对齐大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RLHF和DPO需要直接优化模型参数，无法在测试时使用或适用于无法访问模型权重的情况。

Method: IRO框架通过采样、重采样和训练轻量级价值函数，在测试时通过搜索优化过程指导生成。

Result: IRO允许用户在不访问模型权重的情况下对齐模型，类似于RFT。

Conclusion: IRO提供了一种无需更新模型参数的对齐方法，适用于更广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences usually requires
fine-tuning methods such as RLHF and DPO. These methods directly optimize the
model parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model
performance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible.
In contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward
functions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high
inference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward
or value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a
method named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model
without touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples
candidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions,
and (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding
pass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model
generation via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply
IRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RL后训练中静态长度预算或预定义规则无法适应不同问题复杂度和模型能力变化的问题。

Method: 1) 基于模型置信度和响应特征的群组相对奖励函数；2) 通过熵引导分数平衡训练群组的解准确性和推理多样性的多样性感知采样机制。

Result: 在多个数学推理数据集上的实验表明，AdapThink能实现自适应推理模式并缓解效率低下问题。

Conclusion: AdapThink通过动态机制有效提升了推理效率，同时保持了语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training has significantly advanced
the complex reasoning capabilities of language models, fostering sophisticated
self-reflection processes. However, this ``slow thinking'' paradigm presents a
critical challenge to reasoning efficiency: models may expend excessive
computation on simple questions and shift reasoning prematurely for complex
ones. Previous mechanisms typically rely on static length budgets or predefined
rules, lacking the adaptability for varying question complexities and models'
evolving capabilities. To this end, we propose AdapThink, an adaptive
post-training framework designed to induce more efficient thinking while
maintaining the performance of reasoning language models. Specifically,
AdapThink incorporates two key mechanisms: 1) A group-relative reward function
that leverages model confidence and response's characteristic to dynamically
adjust the preference of reflection-related transition words without resorting
to a fixed length preference. 2) A diversity-aware sampling mechanism that
balances the training group's solution accuracy with reasoning diversity via an
entropy-guided score. Experiments on several mathematical reasoning datasets
with DeepSeek-distilled models demonstrate AdapThink's advantages in enabling
adaptive reasoning patterns and mitigating the inefficiencies.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法依赖领域特定验证器，复杂且难以扩展，限制了其在通用领域的应用。

Method: RLPR通过LLM生成答案的token概率作为奖励信号，并采用prob-to-reward和稳定化方法降低噪声。

Result: 在多个通用和数学领域基准测试中，RLPR显著优于其他方法，如VeriFree和General-Reasoner。

Conclusion: RLPR为强化学习在通用领域的应用提供了简单高效的解决方案，无需依赖验证器。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates promising
potential in advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, its success
remains largely confined to mathematical and code domains. This primary
limitation stems from the heavy reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which
results in prohibitive complexity and limited scalability. To address the
challenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of
generating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of
the reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct
answer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free
framework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains. RLPR uses the
LLM's own token probability scores for reference answers as the reward signal
and maximizes the expected reward during training. We find that addressing the
high variance of this noisy probability reward is crucial to make it work, and
propose prob-to-reward and stabilizing methods to ensure a precise and stable
reward from LLM intrinsic probabilities. Comprehensive experiments in four
general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks show that RLPR
consistently improves reasoning capabilities in both areas for Gemma, Llama,
and Qwen based models. Notably, RLPR outperforms concurrent VeriFree by 7.6
points on TheoremQA and 7.5 points on Minerva, and even surpasses strong
verifier-model-dependent approaches General-Reasoner by 1.6 average points
across seven benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决Mixture of Experts（MoE）架构因内存需求过高而难以在资源受限环境中微调或部署的问题。

Method: 通过分阶段压缩，减少参数数量（如精简专家和知识迁移），避免一次性剪枝的性能下降。

Result: 成功压缩Phi 3.5-MoE为Phi-mini-MoE和Phi-tiny-MoE，性能优于同类小模型，且接近更大模型。

Conclusion: 结构化剪枝与分阶段蒸馏结合，为创建高质量紧凑MoE模型提供了有效途径，推动MoE架构的广泛应用。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs) while maintaining inference
efficiency. However, their enormous memory requirements make them prohibitively
expensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To
address this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression
framework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient
variants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our
method systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and
transferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the
performance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this
framework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to
create Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE
(3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of
the original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned
on a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them
highly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments
demonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and
remain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves
similar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated
parameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having
significantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning
combined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating
high-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE
architectures. We make our models publicly available at

Conclusion: 展示了在分类模型中无需训练的低成本去偏方法，扩展了传统生成模型中使用的“导向向量”应用。

Abstract: Neural network classifiers trained on datasets with uneven group
representation often inherit class biases and learn spurious correlations.
These models may perform well on average but consistently fail on atypical
groups. For example, in hair color classification, datasets may over-represent
females with blond hair, reinforcing stereotypes. Although various algorithmic
and data-centric methods have been proposed to address such biases, they often
require retraining or significant compute. In this work, we propose a cheap,
training-free method inspired by steering vectors used to edit behaviors in
large language models. We compute the difference in mean activations between
majority and minority groups to define a "bias vector," which we subtract from
the model's residual stream. This leads to reduced classification bias and
improved worst-group accuracy. We explore multiple strategies for extracting
and applying these vectors in transformer-like classifiers, showing that
steering vectors, traditionally used in generative models, can also be
effective in classification. More broadly, we showcase an extremely cheap,
inference time, training free method to mitigate bias in classification models.

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning
capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect''
reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions
are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards
can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To
address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers
the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed
reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning
process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The
injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions,
encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima.
Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO
with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits
a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar
duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with
ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these
advantages.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) aims to detect the emotions of
individual utterances within a conversation. Generating efficient and

challenge. Previous studies have proposed various models to integrate features
extracted using different modality-specific encoders. However, they neglect the
varying contributions of modalities to this task and introduce high complexity
by aligning modalities at the frame level. To address these challenges, we
propose the Multi-modal Anchor Gated Transformer with Knowledge Distillation
(MAGTKD) for the ERC task. Specifically, prompt learning is employed to enhance
textual modality representations, while knowledge distillation is utilized to
strengthen representations of weaker modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a
multi-modal anchor gated transformer to effectively integrate utterance-level
representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and
MELD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of knowledge distillation in
enhancing modality representations and achieve state-of-the-art performance in
emotion recognition. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出一种基于神经网络的变点检测方法，利用学习混淆方案识别公共话语中的重大事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共话语的动态变化对理解社会动态至关重要，但高维、稀疏和噪声数据使变点检测具有挑战性。

Method: 通过训练分类器区分不同时间段的新闻文章，利用分类准确率估计内容分布的总变差距离，识别显著变化的变点。

Result: 在合成数据集和《卫报》真实数据中成功检测到重大事件（如9/11、COVID-19大流行和总统选举）。

Conclusion: 该方法无需过多领域知识，能自主发现公共话语的显著变化，为新闻、政策分析和危机监测提供量化工具。

Abstract: Detecting when public discourse shifts in response to major events is crucial
for understanding societal dynamics. Real-world data is high-dimensional,
sparse, and noisy, making changepoint detection in this domain a challenging
endeavor. In this paper, we leverage neural networks for changepoint detection
in news data, introducing a method based on the so-called learning-by-confusion
scheme, which was originally developed for detecting phase transitions in
physical systems. We train classifiers to distinguish between articles from
different time periods. The resulting classification accuracy is used to
estimate the total variation distance between underlying content distributions,
where significant distances highlight changepoints. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this method on both synthetic datasets and real-world data
from The Guardian newspaper, successfully identifying major historical events
including 9/11, the COVID-19 pandemic, and presidential elections. Our approach
requires minimal domain knowledge, can autonomously discover significant shifts
in public discourse, and yields a quantitative measure of change in content,
making it valuable for journalism, policy analysis, and crisis monitoring.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PCaM的渐进式焦点交叉注意力机制，用于解决无监督域适应中前景对象不匹配的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于ViT的无监督域适应方法因前景对象大小和空间分布不一致导致注意力一致性差，影响域对齐效果。

Method: 提出PCaM机制，逐步过滤背景信息，聚焦前景语义；引入注意力引导损失，增强跨域注意力一致性。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了PCaM的有效性，性能显著提升，达到新的SOTA。

Conclusion: PCaM通过注意力引导的前景融合，有效解决了域适应中的前景不匹配问题。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recent UDA methods based
on Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance through
attention-based feature alignment. However, we identify a key limitation:
foreground object mismatch, where the discrepancy in foreground object size and
spatial distribution across domains weakens attention consistency and hampers
effective domain alignment. To address this issue, we propose the Progressive
Focus Cross-Attention Mechanism (PCaM), which progressively filters out
background information during cross-attention, allowing the model to focus on
and fuse discriminative foreground semantics across domains. We further
introduce an attentional guidance loss that explicitly directs attention toward
task-relevant regions, enhancing cross-domain attention consistency. PCaM is
lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and easy to integrate into existing
ViT-based UDA pipelines. Extensive experiments on Office-Home, DomainNet,
VisDA-2017, and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that PCaM significantly
improves adaptation performance and achieves new state-of-the-art results,
validating the effectiveness of attention-guided foreground fusion for domain
adaptation.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖CLIP的预训练知识，但在下游任务中表现受限，尤其是在较弱的主干网络上。

Method: 引入独立分支学习输入空间知识，通过反向注意力和贪婪文本集成增强文本特征，并结合域感知提示进行特征融合。

Conclusion: 直接学习输入空间知识能有效补充CLIP的冻结特征，显著提升少样本域适应性能。

Abstract: Few-shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation focuses on adapting a model at test time
to a specific domain using only a few unlabeled examples, addressing domain
shift. Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities
by generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen
features. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP,
solely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior
knowledge. Notably, when using a less robust backbone like ViT-B/16,
performance significantly drops on challenging real-world benchmarks. Departing
from the state-of-the-art of inheriting the intrinsic OOD capability of CLIP,
this work introduces learning directly on the input space to complement the
dataset-specific knowledge for frozen CLIP. Specifically, an independent side
branch is attached in parallel with CLIP and enforced to learn exclusive
knowledge via revert attention. To better capture the dataset-specific label
semantics for downstream adaptation, we propose to enhance the inter-dispersion
among text features via greedy text ensemble and refinement. The text and
visual features are then progressively fused in a domain-aware manner by a
generated domain prompt to adapt toward a specific domain. Extensive
experiments show our method's superiority on 5 large-scale benchmarks (WILDS
and DomainNet), notably improving over smaller networks like ViT-B/16 with
gains of \textbf{+5.1} in F1 for iWildCam and \textbf{+3.1\%} in WC Acc for
FMoW.

Result: 理论表明自注意力能促进局部特征的全局一致性，实验验证了这一行为。

Conclusion: 自注意力在扩散模型中起到了关键作用，使生成的图像在全局上更一致。

Abstract: As diffusion models have become the tool of choice for image generation and
as the quality of the images continues to improve, the question of how
`creativity' originates in diffusion has become increasingly important. The
score matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for
understanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain
plausible while differing significantly from their training images. In
particular, as explained in (Kamb \& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,
(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we
would only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.
However, as shown by Kamb \& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the
score is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself
(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples
that globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise
`mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role
of self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in
this direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose
score is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that
our theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent
arrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and
we verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多视角数据融合和人工智能技术，显著提升了直肠癌手术难度评估的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: A reliable evaluation of surgical difficulty can improve the success of the
treatment for rectal cancer and the current evaluation method is based on
clinical data. However, more data about rectal cancer can be collected with the
development of technology. Meanwhile, with the development of artificial
intelligence, its application in rectal cancer treatment is becoming possible.
In this paper, a multi-view rectal cancer dataset is first constructed to give
a more comprehensive view of patients, including the high-resolution MRI image
view, pressed-fat MRI image view, and clinical data view. Then, an
interpretable incomplete multi-view surgical evaluation model is proposed,
considering that it is hard to obtain extensive and complete patient data in
real application scenarios. Specifically, a dual representation incomplete
multi-view learning model is first proposed to extract the common information
between views and specific information in each view. In this model, the missing
view imputation is integrated into representation learning, and second-order
similarity constraint is also introduced to improve the cooperative learning
between these two parts. Then, based on the imputed multi-view data and the
learned dual representation, a multi-view surgical evaluation model with the
TSK fuzzy system is proposed. In the proposed model, a cooperative learning
mechanism is constructed to explore the consistent information between views,
and Shannon entropy is also introduced to adapt the view weight. On the MVRC
dataset, we compared it with several advanced algorithms and DRIMV_TSK obtained
the best results.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习框架缺乏结合不确定性量化、可解释性和鲁棒性的综合解决方案。

Method: FedNAM+整合神经加法模型和共形预测方法，利用梯度敏感图动态调整输入特征，提供像素级不确定性估计。

Result: 在CT扫描、MNIST和CIFAR数据集上验证，预测准确率高（如MNIST仅损失0.1%），并提供透明的不确定性度量。

Conclusion: FedNAM+是一个高效、可解释且鲁棒的框架，提升了分散预测建模的可信度和透明度。

Abstract: Federated learning has significantly advanced distributed training of machine
learning models across decentralized data sources. However, existing frameworks
often lack comprehensive solutions that combine uncertainty quantification,
interpretability, and robustness. To address this, we propose FedNAM+, a
federated learning framework that integrates Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with
a novel conformal prediction method to enable interpretable and reliable
uncertainty estimation. Our method introduces a dynamic level adjustment
technique that utilizes gradient-based sensitivity maps to identify key input
features influencing predictions. This facilitates both interpretability and
pixel-wise uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional interpretability methods
such as LIME and SHAP, which do not provide confidence intervals, FedNAM+
offers visual insights into prediction reliability. We validate our approach
through experiments on CT scan, MNIST, and CIFAR datasets, demonstrating high
prediction accuracy with minimal loss (e.g., only 0.1% on MNIST), along with
transparent uncertainty measures. Visual analysis highlights variable
uncertainty intervals, revealing low-confidence regions where model performance
can be improved with additional data. Compared to Monte Carlo Dropout, FedNAM+
delivers efficient and global uncertainty estimates with reduced computational
overhead, making it particularly suitable for federated learning scenarios.
Overall, FedNAM+ provides a robust, interpretable, and computationally
efficient framework that enhances trust and transparency in decentralized
predictive modeling.

Motivation: 现有评估方法无法满足世界模型在动作对齐和语义一致性方面的细粒度、时间敏感评估需求。

Method: 提出UNIVERSE方法，通过适应视觉语言模型（VLM）在数据和计算限制下进行评估，支持动作识别和角色识别的多种任务格式。

Result: UNIVERSE在多种任务格式下表现优异，与任务专用基线性能相当，且与人类判断高度一致。

Conclusion: UNIVERSE是一种可扩展、语义感知的世界模型评估工具，适用于复杂环境下的评估需求。

Abstract: World models -- generative models that simulate environment dynamics
conditioned on past observations and actions -- are gaining prominence in
planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts
remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded
assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not
captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise
as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal
reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive
evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce
a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and
character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and
open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied
Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for
adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We
conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient
finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data
compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of
task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong
alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable,
semantics-aware evaluator for world models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在许多任务中表现优异，但其输出的概率往往存在校准问题，导致不可靠。这激发了通过后处理校准方法来改进的研究。

Method: 论文总结了三种校准策略，并提出h-calibration框架，设计了一种简单有效的后处理校准算法。

Result: 该方法克服了传统方法的十种局限性，并在实验中表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: h-calibration框架为学习误差有界的校准概率提供了理论支持，并在实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across numerous
learning tasks but often suffer from miscalibration, resulting in unreliable
probability outputs. This has inspired many recent works on mitigating
miscalibration, particularly through post-hoc recalibration methods that aim to
obtain calibrated probabilities without sacrificing the classification
performance of pre-trained models. In this study, we summarize and categorize
previous works into three general strategies: intuitively designed methods,
binning-based methods, and methods based on formulations of ideal calibration.
Through theoretical and practical analysis, we highlight ten common limitations
in previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a
probabilistic learning framework for calibration called h-calibration, which
theoretically constructs an equivalent learning formulation for canonical
calibration with boundedness. On this basis, we design a simple yet effective
post-hoc calibration algorithm. Our method not only overcomes the ten
identified limitations but also achieves markedly better performance than
traditional methods, as validated by extensive experiments. We further analyze,
both theoretically and experimentally, the relationship and advantages of our
learning objective compared to traditional proper scoring rule. In summary, our
probabilistic framework derives an approximately equivalent differentiable
objective for learning error-bounded calibrated probabilities, elucidating the
correspondence and convergence properties of computational statistics with
respect to theoretical bounds in canonical calibration. The theoretical
effectiveness is verified on standard post-hoc calibration benchmarks by
achieving state-of-the-art performance. This research offers valuable reference
for learning reliable likelihood in related fields.

Result: 共形预测在分布偏移下不可靠，不适用于提高准确性的预测选择，且在少数类别任务中实用价值有限。

Conclusion: 共形预测在医学分类任务中存在显著局限性，需谨慎应用。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is one of the major challenges for medical
classification tasks. While many approaches have been proposed, recently the
statistical framework of conformal predictions has gained a lot of attention,
due to its ability to provide provable calibration guarantees. Nonetheless, the
application of conformal predictions in safety-critical areas such as medicine
comes with pitfalls, limitations and assumptions that practitioners need to be
aware of. We demonstrate through examples from dermatology and histopathology
that conformal predictions are unreliable under distributional shifts in input
and label variables. Additionally, conformal predictions should not be used for
selecting predictions to improve accuracy and are not reliable for subsets of
the data, such as individual classes or patient attributes. Moreover, in
classification settings with a small number of classes, which are common in
medical image classification tasks, conformal predictions have limited
practical value.

Abstract: A significant ``modality gap" exists between the abundance of text-only data
and the increasing power of multimodal models. This work systematically
investigates whether images generated on-the-fly by Text-to-Image (T2I) models
can serve as a valuable complementary modality for text-centric tasks. Through
a comprehensive evaluation framework on text classification, we analyze the
impact of critical variables, including T2I model quality, prompt engineering
strategies, and multimodal fusion architectures. Our findings demonstrate that
this``synthetic perception" can yield significant performance gains, even when
augmenting strong large language model baselines. However, we find the
effectiveness of this approach is highly conditional, depending critically on
the semantic alignment between text and the generated image, the inherent
``visual groundability" of the task, and the generative fidelity of the T2I
model. Our work establishes the first rigorous benchmark for this paradigm,
providing a clear analysis of its potential and current limitations, and
demonstrating its viability as a pathway to enrich language understanding in
traditionally unimodal scenarios.

Motivation: 解决LLM因神经激活短暂和FFN权重无结构导致的信息衰减和语义碎片化问题。

Method: 1. 持久活动机制（PA）动态管理FFN状态；2. 皮质专家聚类（CE）重组FFN权重为语义模块。

Result: 在多项任务中性能提升6-17.5%，上下文长度扩展至20万token。

Conclusion: PaceLLM为脑启发的LLM优化提供了新思路，可推广至其他模型，无需结构大改。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance across
domains, their long-context capabilities are limited by transient neural
activations causing information decay and unstructured feed-forward network
(FFN) weights leading to semantic fragmentation. Inspired by the brain's
working memory and cortical modularity, we propose PaceLLM, featuring two
innovations: (1) a Persistent Activity (PA) Mechanism that mimics prefrontal
cortex (PFC) neurons' persistent firing by introducing an activation-level
memory bank to dynamically retrieve, reuse, and update critical FFN states,
addressing contextual decay; and (2) Cortical Expert (CE) Clustering that
emulates task-adaptive neural specialization to reorganize FFN weights into
semantic modules, establishing cross-token dependencies and mitigating
fragmentation. Extensive evaluations show that PaceLLM achieves 6% improvement
on LongBench's Multi-document QA and 12.5-17.5% performance gains on
Infinite-Bench tasks, while extending measurable context length to 200K tokens
in Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) tests. This work pioneers brain-inspired LLM
optimization and is complementary to other works. Besides, it can be
generalized to any model and enhance their long-context performance and
interpretability without structural overhauls.

Abstract: With the increasing complexity and rapid expansion of the scale of AI systems
in cloud platforms, the log data generated during system operation is massive,
unstructured, and semantically ambiguous, which brings great challenges to
fault location and system self-repair. In order to solve this problem, this
paper proposes an intelligent log processing and automatic debugging framework
based on Large Language Model (LLM), named Intelligent Debugger (LLM-ID). This
method is extended on the basis of the existing pre-trained Transformer model,
and integrates a multi-stage semantic inference mechanism to realize the
context understanding of system logs and the automatic reconstruction of fault
chains. Firstly, the system log is dynamically structured, and the unsupervised
clustering and embedding mechanism is used to extract the event template and
semantic schema. Subsequently, the fine-tuned LLM combined with the multi-round
attention mechanism to perform contextual reasoning on the log sequence to
generate potential fault assumptions and root cause paths. Furthermore, this
paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based policy-guided recovery planner,
which is driven by the remediation strategy generated by LLM to support dynamic
decision-making and adaptive debugging in the cloud environment. Compared with
the existing rule engine or traditional log analysis system, the proposed model
has stronger semantic understanding ability, continuous learning ability and
heterogeneous environment adaptability. Experiments on the cloud platform log
dataset show that LLM-ID improves the fault location accuracy by 16.2%, which
is significantly better than the current mainstream methods

Conclusion: Active Indexing通过多样化合成数据和双向生成任务，显著提升模型引用能力，且性能随数据量增加持续提升。

Abstract: Trustworthy language models should provide both correct and verifiable
answers. While language models can sometimes attribute their outputs to
pretraining data, their citations are often unreliable due to hallucination. As
a result, current systems insert citations by querying an external retriever at
inference time, introducing latency, infrastructure dependence, and
vulnerability to retrieval noise. We explore whether LLMs can be made to
reliably attribute to the documents seen during (continual)
pretraining--without test-time retrieval--by revising the training process. To
evaluate this, we release CitePretrainBench, a benchmark that mixes real-world
corpora (Wikipedia, Common Crawl, arXiv) with novel, unseen documents and
probes both short-form (single fact) and long-form (multi-fact) citation tasks.
Our approach follows a two-stage process: (1) continual pretraining to bind
facts to persistent document identifiers, and (2) instruction tuning to elicit
citation behavior. We find that simple Passive Indexing, which appends an
identifier to each document, helps memorize verbatim text but fails on
paraphrased or compositional facts. Instead, we propose Active Indexing, which
continually pretrains on synthetic QA pairs that (1) restate each fact in
diverse compositional forms, and (2) require bidirectional source-to-fact and
fact-to-source generation, jointly teaching the model to generate content from
a cited source and to attribute its own answers. Experiments with Qwen2.5-7B
and 3B show that Active Indexing consistently outperforms Passive Indexing
across all tasks and models, with citation precision gains up to 30.2 percent.
Our ablation studies reveal that performance continues to improve as we scale
the amount of augmented data, showing a clear upward trend even at 16 times the
original token count.

Abstract: Social reasoning - inferring unobservable beliefs and intentions from partial
observations of other agents - remains a challenging task for large language
models (LLMs). We evaluate the limits of current reasoning language models in
the social deduction game Avalon and find that while the largest models
demonstrate strong performance, they require extensive test-time inference and
degrade sharply when distilled to smaller, real-time-capable variants. To
address this, we introduce a hybrid reasoning framework that externalizes
belief inference to a structured probabilistic model, while using an LLM for
language understanding and interaction. Our approach achieves competitive

### [338] [Evolving Prompts In-Context: An Open-ended, Self-replicating Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17930)
*Jianyu Wang,Zhiqiang Hu,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的提示设计范式，通过修剪随机演示为看似不连贯的“胡言乱语”来提升大语言模型（LLM）性能，并开发了自动优化框架PromptQuine。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统提示设计的智慧，探索更高效的提示优化方法。

Method: 提出PromptQuine框架，通过进化搜索自动寻找修剪策略，仅需少量数据。

Result: “胡言乱语”提示在多种任务中表现优异，超越现有自动优化技术。

Conclusion: 研究为上下文学习机制研究提供新方向，并呼吁开发更开放的搜索算法。

Abstract: We propose a novel prompt design paradigm that challenges conventional wisdom
in large language model (LLM) prompting. While conventional wisdom prioritizes
well-crafted instructions and demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL), we
show that pruning random demonstrations into seemingly incoherent "gibberish"
can remarkably improve performance across diverse tasks. Notably, the
"gibberish" always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt
optimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM
alignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is
non-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms
fail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we
propose a self-discover prompt optimization framework, PromptQuine, an
evolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning
strategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent
complexity in nature--such as symbiosis and self-organization--arising in
response to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines
unconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens
present within the context. We demonstrate its effectiveness across
classification, multi-choice question answering, generation and math reasoning
tasks across LLMs, while achieving decent runtime efficiency. We hope our
findings can guide mechanistic studies on in-context learning, and provide a
call to action, to pave the way for more open-ended search algorithms for more
effective LLM prompting.

Result: SE-Merging显著提升了性能，且无需额外训练，与现有技术兼容。

Conclusion: SE-Merging通过动态任务识别和自适应合并系数，有效增强了模型合并的多任务能力。

Abstract: Model merging has gained increasing attention due to its intriguing property:
interpolating the parameters of different task-specific fine-tuned models leads
to multi-task abilities. However, despite its empirical success, the underlying
mechanisms of model merging remain poorly understood. In this work, we delve
into the mechanism behind model merging from a representation perspective. Our
analysis reveals that model merging achieves multi-task abilities through two
key capabilities: i) distinguishing samples from different tasks, and ii)
adapting to the corresponding expert model for each sample. These two
capabilities allow the merged model to retain task-specific expertise, enabling
efficient multi-task adaptation. Building on these insights, we propose
\texttt{SE-Merging}, a self-enhanced model merging framework that leverages
these two characteristics to dynamically identify the corresponding task for
each sample and then adaptively rescales the merging coefficients to further
enhance task-specific expertise in the merged model. Notably,
\texttt{SE-Merging} achieves dynamic model merging without additional training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{SE-Merging} achieves significant
performance improvements while remaining compatible with existing model merging
techniques.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了推理语言模型的不确定性量化问题，发现模型通常过于自信，尤其是错误答案时，且深度推理会加剧这一问题。通过内省式不确定性量化（UQ）可以部分改善校准性。


<details>

Motivation: 推理模型在生成答案时容易出现自信但错误的幻觉，了解何时信任模型对实际应用至关重要。

Method: 提出内省式不确定性量化（UQ），通过模型对自身推理链的反思来评估校准性。

Result: 研究发现推理模型通常过于自信，深度推理会加剧这一问题，而内省式UQ能部分改善校准性，但效果因模型而异。

Conclusion: 未来需设计更多UQ基准测试以提升推理模型的校准性。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have set state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on many
challenging benchmarks, enabled by multi-step reasoning induced using
reinforcement learning. However, like previous language models, reasoning
models are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are
incorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is
critical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications.
To this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this
work. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning
models well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model
calibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their
thought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,
we ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning
about their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty
quantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA
reasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning
models: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence
estimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)
become even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become
better calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not
uniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we
conclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks
and improve the calibration of reasoning models.

Conclusion: Airalogy通过标准化和AI驱动，为全球研究社区提供高效数据管理工具，推动科学发展。

Abstract: Research data are the foundation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven
science, yet current AI applications remain limited to a few fields with
readily available, well-structured, digitized datasets. Achieving comprehensive
AI empowerment across multiple disciplines is still out of reach. Present-day
research data collection is often fragmented, lacking unified standards,
inefficiently managed, and difficult to share. Creating a single platform for
standardized data digitization needs to overcome the inherent challenge of
balancing between universality (supporting the diverse, ever-evolving needs of
various disciplines) and standardization (enforcing consistent formats to fully
enable AI). No existing platform accommodates both facets. Building a truly
multidisciplinary platform requires integrating scientific domain knowledge
with sophisticated computing skills. Researchers often lack the computational
expertise to design customized and standardized data recording methods, whereas
platform developers rarely grasp the intricate needs of multiple scientific
domains. These gaps impede research data standardization and hamper AI-driven
progress. In this study, we address these challenges by developing Airalogy
(https://airalogy.com), the world's first AI- and community-driven platform
that balances universality and standardization for digitizing research data
across multiple disciplines. Airalogy represents entire research workflows
using customizable, standardized data records and offers an advanced AI
research copilot for intelligent Q&A, automated data entry, analysis, and
research automation. Already deployed in laboratories across all four schools
of Westlake University, Airalogy has the potential to accelerate and automate
scientific innovation in universities, industry, and the global research
community-ultimately benefiting humanity as a whole.

Conclusion: 注意力头的选择和特征优化对检测性能至关重要。

Abstract: In real-world applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate,
even in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which poses a
significant challenge to their deployment. In this paper, we introduce
AggTruth, a method for online detection of contextual hallucinations by
analyzing the distribution of internal attention scores in the provided context
(passage). Specifically, we propose four different variants of the method, each
varying in the aggregation technique used to calculate attention scores. Across
all LLMs examined, AggTruth demonstrated stable performance in both same-task
and cross-task setups, outperforming the current SOTA in multiple scenarios.
Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of feature selection techniques
and examined how the number of selected attention heads impacts detection
performance, demonstrating that careful selection of heads is essential to
achieve optimal results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs通过源代码训练提升通用推理能力的机制。

Method: 通过微调LLMs在两组程序（含I/O示例和无I/O示例）上，比较其评估能力。

Result: LLMs能通过源代码隐式评估程序，PBB效果优于传统I/O训练。

Conclusion: 代码训练使LLMs内化可重用算法抽象，未来可探索符号化学习以提升模型能力。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) on source code significantly enhances
their general-purpose reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying this
generalisation are poorly understood. In this paper, we propose Programming by
Backprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to
evaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without
ever seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of
programs representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source
code and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We
find evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for
inputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.
Firstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code
rather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can
produce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the
program within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the
program in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more
robust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn
from a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest
a mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to
internalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for
future work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,
and progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by
training on formal constitutional principles.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出ConciseHint框架，通过注入文本提示在推理过程中鼓励模型简洁表达，解决大型推理模型生成冗长推理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型（如DeepSeek-R1和OpenAI o1系列）在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但倾向于生成冗长推理过程，导致效率低下。现有方法主要在推理前优化，忽略了在推理生成过程中直接干预的潜力。

Method: 提出ConciseHint框架，在推理生成过程中动态注入文本提示（手动设计或基于简洁数据训练），并根据查询复杂度自适应调整提示强度。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1和Qwen-3系列模型上实验表明，ConciseHint能显著减少推理长度（如GSM8K基准上推理长度减少65%），同时保持性能。

Conclusion: ConciseHint有效解决了大型推理模型冗长推理问题，为推理效率优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and
OpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex
reasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT).
However, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose
reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature
on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such
as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the
promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by
intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we
propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the
reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually
designed or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the
reasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the
query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not
undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs,
including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can
effectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance
well. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\% for the reasoning
length on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss.

(LoRA) adapters to optimize performance across diverse retrieval scenarios,

Motivation: 现有方法依赖历史截图或动作隐式表示任务状态，导致GUI代理难以准确理解任务状态，且缺乏存储复杂跨应用任务关键信息的机制。

Conclusion: CoM为GUI代理提供了有效的记忆管理机制，解决了复杂任务中的信息存储问题，数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are attracting growing attention in
the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. Existing approaches
often rely on historical screenshots or actions to implicitly represent the
task state. This reliance poses challenges for GUI agents in accurately
understanding task states and underscores the absence of effective mechanisms
to store critical information in complex and lengthy cross-app tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose Chain-of-Memory (CoM), a novel approach
for explicitly modeling short-term and long-term memory in GUI agents. CoM
achieves this by capturing action descriptions, integrating task-relevant
screen information, and maintaining a dedicated memory module to store and
manage this information. By leveraging explicit memory representations, CoM
enables GUI agents to better understand task states and retain critical
historical information persistently. To equip GUI agents with memory management
capabilities and evaluate the effectiveness of CoM, we developed the GUI
Odyssey-CoM, a dataset comprising 111k screen-action pairs annotated with
Chain-of-Memory. Experimental results demonstrate that CoM significantly
improves GUI agents' performance in cross-application tasks. Additionally, GUI
Odyssey-CoM enables 7B models to achieve memory management capabilities
comparable to 72B models. The dataset and code will be open-sourced.

Motivation: 解决现有合成数据在双机械臂操作中的不足，包括缺乏高效的数据生成方法和过于简化的仿真环境。

Method: 结合多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）和仿真循环优化，自动生成任务级执行代码，并通过结构化域随机化增强数据多样性。

Conclusion: RoboTwin 2.0显著提升了双机械臂操作的鲁棒性和泛化能力，支持可扩展的研究。

Abstract: Simulation-based data synthesis has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
enhancing real-world robotic manipulation. However, existing synthetic datasets
remain insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to two challenges: (1)
the lack of an efficient, scalable data generation method for novel tasks, and
(2) oversimplified simulation environments that fail to capture real-world
complexity. We present RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable simulation framework that
enables automated, large-scale generation of diverse and realistic data, along
with unified evaluation protocols for dual-arm manipulation. We first construct
RoboTwin-OD, a large-scale object library comprising 731 instances across 147
categories, each annotated with semantic and manipulation-relevant labels.
Building on this foundation, we develop an expert data synthesis pipeline that
combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with simulation-in-the-loop
refinement to generate task-level execution code automatically. To improve
sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 incorporates structured domain randomization
along five axes: clutter, lighting, background, tabletop height and language
instructions, thereby enhancing data diversity and policy robustness. We
instantiate this framework across 50 dual-arm tasks spanning five robot
embodiments, and pre-collect over 100,000 domain-randomized expert
trajectories. Empirical results show a 10.9% gain in code generation success
and improved generalization to novel real-world scenarios. A VLA model
fine-tuned on our dataset achieves a 367% relative improvement (42.0% vs. 9.0%)
on unseen scene real-world tasks, while zero-shot models trained solely on our
synthetic data achieve a 228% relative gain, highlighting strong generalization
without real-world supervision. We release the data generator, benchmark,
dataset, and code to support scalable research in robust bimanual manipulation.

Abstract: This paper presents a simulation workflow for generating synthetic LiDAR

sensor security analysis. Leveraging the CoppeliaSim simulation environment and
its Python API, we integrate time-of-flight LiDAR, image sensors, and two
dimensional scanners onto a simulated vehicle platform operating within an
urban scenario. The workflow automates data capture, storage, and annotation
across multiple formats (PCD, PLY, CSV), producing synchronized multimodal
datasets with ground truth pose information. We validate the pipeline by
generating large-scale point clouds and corresponding RGB and depth imagery.
The study examines potential security vulnerabilities in LiDAR data, such as
adversarial point injection and spoofing attacks, and demonstrates how
synthetic datasets can facilitate the evaluation of defense strategies.
Finally, limitations related to environmental realism, sensor noise modeling,
and computational scalability are discussed, and future research directions,
such as incorporating weather effects, real-world terrain models, and advanced
scanner configurations, are proposed. The workflow provides a versatile,

Abstract: Developing general-purpose navigation policies for unknown environments
remains a core challenge in robotics. Most existing systems rely on
task-specific neural networks and fixed data flows, limiting generalizability.
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative by embedding
human-like knowledge suitable for reasoning and planning. Yet, prior LVLM-robot
integrations typically depend on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations,
and myopic exploration. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation
Architecture (ARNA), a general-purpose navigation framework that equips an
LVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools
available within modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously
defines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query the robotic
modules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select appropriate navigation
actions. This approach enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously
unmapped environments, providing a new perspective on robotic stack design.
Evaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating effective exploration, navigation,
and embodied question answering without relying on handcrafted plans, fixed
input representations, or pre-existing maps.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义动作空间和标注数据，限制了在动态场景中的适应性和扩展性。

Method: EASE利用预测误差和熵作为内在信号，结合生成感知模型和动作驱动策略，动态对齐预测与观测。

Result: 在仿真和真实场景中，EASE实现了隐私保护和可扩展的事件感知，支持隐式记忆和目标连续性。

Conclusion: EASE为动态任务中的具身系统提供了鲁棒基础。

Abstract: Active event perception, the ability to dynamically detect, track, and
summarize events in real time, is essential for embodied intelligence in tasks
such as human-AI collaboration, assistive robotics, and autonomous navigation.
However, existing approaches often depend on predefined action spaces,
annotated datasets, and extrinsic rewards, limiting their adaptability and
scalability in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Inspired by cognitive theories of
event perception and predictive coding, we propose EASE, a self-supervised
framework that unifies spatiotemporal representation learning and embodied
control through free energy minimization. EASE leverages prediction errors and
entropy as intrinsic signals to segment events, summarize observations, and
actively track salient actors, operating without explicit annotations or
external rewards. By coupling a generative perception model with an
action-driven control policy, EASE dynamically aligns predictions with
observations, enabling emergent behaviors such as implicit memory, target
continuity, and adaptability to novel environments. Extensive evaluations in
simulation and real-world settings demonstrate EASE's ability to achieve
privacy-preserving and scalable event perception, providing a robust foundation
for embodied systems in unscripted, dynamic tasks.

Abstract: Achieving reliable ego motion estimation for agile robots, e.g., aerobatic
aircraft, remains challenging because most robot sensors fail to respond timely
and clearly to highly dynamic robot motions, often resulting in measurement
blurring, distortion, and delays. In this paper, we propose an IMU-free and
feature-association-free framework to achieve aggressive ego-motion velocity
estimation of a robot platform in highly dynamic scenarios by combining two
types of exteroceptive sensors, an event camera and a millimeter wave radar,
First, we used instantaneous raw events and Doppler measurements to derive
rotational and translational velocities directly. Without a sophisticated
association process between measurement frames, the proposed method is more
robust in texture-less and structureless environments and is more
computationally efficient for edge computing devices. Then, in the back-end, we
propose a continuous-time state-space model to fuse the hybrid time-based and
event-based measurements to estimate the ego-motion velocity in a fixed-lagged
smoother fashion. In the end, we validate our velometer framework extensively

*Anirban Ghosh,Ian Dahlin,Ayan Dutta*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TDACloud的新方法，利用拓扑数据分析（TDA）从点云中提取局部描述符，无需GPU密集型训练，适用于噪声和变换条件下的点云识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云识别在自动驾驶等应用中具有重要意义，但现有方法在噪声或变换条件下表现不佳，需要高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 采用ATOL向量化方法生成点云的TDA描述符向量，直接处理原始点云并输出固定大小的描述符。

Result: 在多个真实和仿真数据集上测试，TDACloud在噪声和变换条件下表现出高识别准确率，优于基线方法约14%。

Conclusion: TDACloud是一种高效且鲁棒的点云识别方法，适用于复杂场景，无需GPU训练，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Point cloud-based object/place recognition remains a problem of interest in
applications such as autonomous driving, scene reconstruction, and
localization. Extracting meaningful local descriptors from a query point cloud
that can be matched with the descriptors of the collected point clouds is a
challenging problem. Furthermore, when the query point cloud is noisy or has
been transformed (e.g., rotated), it adds to the complexity. To this end, we
propose a novel methodology, named TDACloud, using Topological Data Analysis
(TDA) for local descriptor extraction from a point cloud, which does not need
resource-intensive GPU-based machine learning training. More specifically, we
used the ATOL vectorization method to generate vectors for point clouds. Unlike
voxelization, our proposed technique can take raw point clouds as inputs and
outputs a fixed-size TDA-descriptor vector. To test the quality of the proposed
TDACloud technique, we have implemented it on multiple real-world (e.g., Oxford
RobotCar, KITTI-360) and realistic (e.g., ShapeNet) point cloud datasets for
object and place recognition. We have also tested TDACloud on noisy and
transformed test cases where the query point cloud has been scaled, translated,
or rotated. Our results demonstrate high recognition accuracies in noisy
conditions and large-scale real-world place recognition while outperforming the
baselines by up to approximately 14%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模拟器的方法，利用多曝光数据集BorealHDR及其扩展，离线评估自动曝光（AE）方法，解决了传统在线评估不可复现的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准数据集的固定传感器参数限制了主动调整传感器参数的方法（如AE）的比较，且传统在线评估实验不可复现。

Method: 利用BorealHDR多曝光数据集及其扩展，开发模拟器生成不同曝光时间的图像，离线评估AE方法。

Result: 模拟图像的RMSE低于1.78%，评估了8种AE方法，发现经典AE方法表现最佳。

Conclusion: 离线方法提高了实验复现性，经典AE方法仍最优，并公开了数据集和硬件平台细节。

Abstract: Standard datasets often present limitations, particularly due to the fixed
nature of input data sensors, which makes it difficult to compare methods that
actively adjust sensor parameters to suit environmental conditions. This is the
case with Automatic-Exposure (AE) methods, which rely on environmental factors
to influence the image acquisition process. As a result, AE methods have
traditionally been benchmarked in an online manner, rendering experiments
non-reproducible. Building on our prior work, we propose a methodology that
utilizes an emulator capable of generating images at any exposure time. This
approach leverages BorealHDR, a unique multi-exposure stereo dataset, along
with its new extension, in which data was acquired along a repeated trajectory
at different times of the day to assess the impact of changing illumination. In
total, BorealHDR covers 13.4 km over 59 trajectories in challenging lighting
conditions. The dataset also includes lidar-inertial-odometry-based maps with
pose estimation for each image frame, as well as Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) data for comparison. We demonstrate that by using images acquired
at various exposure times, we can emulate realistic images with a
Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) below 1.78% compared to ground truth images.
Using this offline approach, we benchmarked eight AE methods, concluding that
the classical AE method remains the field's best performer. To further support
reproducibility, we provide in-depth details on the development of our backpack
acquisition platform, including hardware, electrical components, and
performance specifications. Additionally, we share valuable lessons learned
from deploying the backpack over more than 25 km across various environments.

Motivation: 现有高斯溅射SLAM方法局限于小规模室内环境，无法满足大规模户外多智能体场景的需求。

Method: GRAND-SLAM结合了基于局部优化的隐式跟踪模块和多智能体闭环检测的位姿图优化框架。

Result: 在Replica室内数据集上，GRAND-SLAM的跟踪性能和PSNR分别优于现有方法28%；在Kimera-Multi户外数据集上，多智能体跟踪误差降低91%。

Conclusion: GRAND-SLAM为大规模多智能体户外环境提供了一种高效的高斯溅射SLAM解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as an expressive scene representation for
RGB-D visual SLAM, but its application to large-scale, multi-agent outdoor
environments remains unexplored. Multi-agent Gaussian SLAM is a promising
approach to rapid exploration and reconstruction of environments, offering
scalable environment representations, but existing approaches are limited to
small-scale, indoor environments. To that end, we propose Gaussian
Reconstruction via Multi-Agent Dense SLAM, or GRAND-SLAM, a collaborative
Gaussian splatting SLAM method that integrates i) an implicit tracking module
based on local optimization over submaps and ii) an approach to inter- and
intra-robot loop closure integrated into a pose-graph optimization framework.
Experiments show that GRAND-SLAM provides state-of-the-art tracking performance
and 28% higher PSNR than existing methods on the Replica indoor dataset, as
well as 91% lower multi-agent tracking error and improved rendering over
existing multi-agent methods on the large-scale, outdoor Kimera-Multi dataset.

Conclusion: BlenderFusion为复杂场景编辑提供了高效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: We present BlenderFusion, a generative visual compositing framework that
synthesizes new scenes by recomposing objects, camera, and background. It
follows a layering-editing-compositing pipeline: (i) segmenting and converting
visual inputs into editable 3D entities (layering), (ii) editing them in
Blender with 3D-grounded control (editing), and (iii) fusing them into a
coherent scene using a generative compositor (compositing). Our generative
compositor extends a pre-trained diffusion model to process both the original
(source) and edited (target) scenes in parallel. It is fine-tuned on video
frames with two key training strategies: (i) source masking, enabling flexible
modifications like background replacement; (ii) simulated object jittering,
facilitating disentangled control over objects and camera. BlenderFusion
significantly outperforms prior methods in complex compositional scene editing
tasks.

Conclusion: 论文方法有效解决了大规模场景重建的挑战，代码将开源。

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have made significant advances
in surface reconstruction. However, scaling these methods to large-scale scenes
remains challenging due to high computational demands and the complex dynamic
appearances typical of outdoor environments. These challenges hinder the
application in aerial surveying and autonomous driving. This paper proposes a
novel solution to reconstruct large-scale surfaces with fine details,
supervised by full-sized images. Firstly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine
strategy to reconstruct a coarse model efficiently, followed by adaptive scene
partitioning and sub-scene refining from image segments. Additionally, we
integrate a decoupling appearance model to capture global appearance variations
and a transient mask model to mitigate interference from moving objects.
Finally, we expand the multi-view constraint and introduce a single-view
regularization for texture-less areas. Our experiments were conducted on the
publicly available dataset GauU-Scene V2, which was captured using unmanned
aerial vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, our method outperforms existing
NeRF-based and Gaussian-based methods, achieving high-fidelity visual results
and accurate surface from full-size image optimization. Open-source code will
be available on GitHub.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用GPU波通信内在特性避免重复纹理解压缩的新算法，提高了纹理放大过滤的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机纹理过滤（STF）技术在放大时可能导致视觉外观变化、噪声和闪烁，需要改进。

Method: 利用GPU波通信内在特性，在活动着色器内共享解码的纹理值，避免重复解压缩，并提出新的过滤回退方法。

Result: 实现了零误差过滤（在足够大的放大因子下），并在其他情况下提供了比现有方法更高质量的过滤。

Conclusion: 新算法显著提升了纹理放大过滤的质量和效率，减少了计算开销。

Abstract: Recent advances in texture compression provide major improvements in
compression ratios, but cannot use the GPU's texture units for decompression
and filtering. This has led to the development of stochastic texture filtering
(STF) techniques to avoid the high cost of multiple texel evaluations with such
formats. Unfortunately, those methods can give undesirable visual appearance
changes under magnification and may contain visible noise and flicker despite
the use of spatiotemporal denoisers. Recent work substantially improves the
quality of magnification filtering with STF by sharing decoded texel values
between nearby pixels (Wronski 2025). Using GPU wave communication intrinsics,
this sharing can be performed inside actively executing shaders without memory
traffic overhead. We take this idea further and present novel algorithms that
use wave communication between lanes to avoid repeated texel decompression
prior to filtering. By distributing unique work across lanes, we can achieve
zero-error filtering using <=1 texel evaluations per pixel given a sufficiently
large magnification factor. For the remaining cases, we propose novel filtering
fallback methods that also achieve higher quality than prior approaches.

Motivation: 现有方法生成的切割图集虽然技术有效，但缺乏语义连贯性，导致碎片化问题。

Method: 将表面切割任务转化为下一个标记预测任务，通过采样点云编码形状条件，并使用GPT风格变换器顺序预测切割缝段。

Result: 在包含流形和非流形网格的UV展开基准测试中表现优异，并为3D分割工具提供了清晰的边界。

Conclusion: SeamGPT通过模仿专业工作流程，显著提升了表面切割的语义连贯性和技术性能。

Abstract: Surface cutting is a fundamental task in computer graphics, with applications
in UV parameterization, texture mapping, and mesh decomposition. However,
existing methods often produce technically valid but overly fragmented atlases
that lack semantic coherence. We introduce SeamGPT, an auto-regressive model
that generates cutting seams by mimicking professional workflows. Our key
technical innovation lies in formulating surface cutting as a next token
prediction task: sample point clouds on mesh vertices and edges, encode them as
shape conditions, and employ a GPT-style transformer to sequentially predict
seam segments with quantized 3D coordinates. Our approach achieves exceptional
performance on UV unwrapping benchmarks containing both manifold and
non-manifold meshes, including artist-created, and 3D-scanned models. In
addition, it enhances existing 3D segmentation tools by providing clean
boundaries for part decomposition.

TL;DR: Morse是一个无损加速扩散模型的双采样框架，通过快速跳跃采样和自适应残差反馈策略提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成过程通常计算密集，Morse旨在无损加速这一过程。

Method: Morse包含Dash和Dot两个模型，Dash进行跳跃采样，Dot生成残差反馈，两者通过权重共享策略高效协作。

Result: 在6个图像生成任务中，Morse平均实现1.78X到3.31X的无损加速，优于9个基线模型。

Conclusion: Morse不仅高效，还能泛化到其他加速模型如LCM-SDXL，适用于少步文本到图像合成。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for
accelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to
reformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking
advantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.
Specifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with
each other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,
but operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling
efficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash
model, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the
observations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash
model, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the
Dash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot
models run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly
attaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime
efficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot
models, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a
lossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling
step budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation
tasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve
the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with
consistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image
synthesis. The code and models are available at

Motivation: 传递函数（TFs）在体绘制（DVR）中至关重要，但设计有效的TFs仍不直观，现有优化方法存在探索空间大和泛化性弱的挑战。

Method: 提出WYTWYG框架，包含基于进化的TF空间探索器和基于MLLMs的渲染质量评估器，并开发了交互式TF设计系统。

Result: 通过三个案例研究展示了框架的通用性，并通过实验验证了各组件的有效性。

Conclusion: WYTWYG框架通过结合进化探索和MLLMs指导，显著提升了TF优化的效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Direct volume rendering (DVR) is a fundamental technique for visualizing
volumetric data, with transfer functions (TFs) playing a crucial role in
extracting meaningful structures. However, designing effective TFs remains
unintuitive due to the semantic gap between user intent and TF parameter space.
Researchers have developed numerous TF optimization methods to bridge this gap.
However, existing methods still face two challenges: large exploration space
and weak generalizability. To address these issues, we propose What You Think
is What You Get (WYTWYG) framework, which leveraging Multi-model Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to guide the TF optimization based on user intent. Specifically,
we first introduce a novel TF optimization approach comprising two core
components: (1) an evolution-based explorer for effective exploration of the TF
space, and (2) a volume rendering quality evaluator based on MLLMs to provide
generalizable visual guidance. We further propose a TF interactive design
system based on this approach. We demonstrate the general applicability of our
framework through three case studies, and validate the effectiveness of each
component through extensive experiments. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Transforming casually captured, monocular videos into fully immersive dynamic
experiences is a highly ill-posed task, and comes with significant challenges,
e.g., reconstructing unseen regions, and dealing with the ambiguity in
monocular depth estimation. In this work we introduce BulletGen, an approach
that takes advantage of generative models to correct errors and complete
missing information in a Gaussian-based dynamic scene representation. This is
done by aligning the output of a diffusion-based video generation model with
the 4D reconstruction at a single frozen "bullet-time" step. The generated
frames are then used to supervise the optimization of the 4D Gaussian model.
Our method seamlessly blends generative content with both static and dynamic
scene components, achieving state-of-the-art results on both novel-view
synthesis, and 2D/3D tracking tasks.

Conclusion: DuetGen通过分层掩码建模和专用交互表示，成功生成了同步且交互性强的双人舞蹈，为舞蹈生成领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present DuetGen, a novel framework for generating interactive two-person
dances from music. The key challenge of this task lies in the inherent
complexities of two-person dance interactions, where the partners need to
synchronize both with each other and with the music. Inspired by the recent
advances in motion synthesis, we propose a two-stage solution: encoding
two-person motions into discrete tokens and then generating these tokens from
music. To effectively capture intricate interactions, we represent both
dancers' motions as a unified whole to learn the necessary motion tokens, and
adopt a coarse-to-fine learning strategy in both the stages. Our first stage
utilizes a VQ-VAE that hierarchically separates high-level semantic features at
a coarse temporal resolution from low-level details at a finer resolution,
producing two discrete token sequences at different abstraction levels.
Subsequently, in the second stage, two generative masked transformers learn to
map music signals to these dance tokens: the first producing high-level
semantic tokens, and the second, conditioned on music and these semantic
tokens, producing the low-level tokens. We train both transformers to learn to
predict randomly masked tokens within the sequence, enabling them to
iteratively generate motion tokens by filling an empty token sequence during
inference. Through the hierarchical masked modeling and dedicated interaction
representation, DuetGen achieves the generation of synchronized and interactive
two-person dances across various genres. Extensive experiments and user studies
on a benchmark duet dance dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
DuetGen in motion realism, music-dance alignment, and partner coordination.

Abstract: Cognitive impairment (CI) is of growing public health concern, and early
detection is vital for effective intervention. Speech has gained attention as a
non-invasive and easily collectible biomarker for assessing cognitive decline.
Traditional CI detection methods typically rely on supervised models trained on
acoustic and linguistic features extracted from speech, which often require
manual annotation and may not generalise well across datasets and languages. In
this work, we propose the first zero-shot speech-based CI detection method
using the Qwen2- Audio AudioLLM, a model capable of processing both audio and
text inputs. By designing prompt-based instructions, we guide the model in
classifying speech samples as indicative of normal cognition or cognitive
impairment. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: one in English and
another multilingual, spanning different cognitive assessment tasks. Our
results show that the zero-shot AudioLLM approach achieves performance
comparable to supervised methods and exhibits promising generalizability and
consistency across languages, tasks, and datasets.

Result: 在多语言、多流派的歌词上表现优异，抗干扰能力强，优于现有音频检测方法。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了实际应用中的空白，为AI生成音乐的检测提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent rise in capabilities of AI-based music generation tools has
created an upheaval in the music industry, necessitating the creation of
accurate methods to detect such AI-generated content. This can be done using
audio-based detectors; however, it has been shown that they struggle to
generalize to unseen generators or when the audio is perturbed. Furthermore,
recent work used accurate and cleanly formatted lyrics sourced from a lyrics
provider database to detect AI-generated music. However, in practice, such
perfect lyrics are not available (only the audio is); this leaves a substantial
gap in applicability in real-life use cases. In this work, we instead propose
solving this gap by transcribing songs using general automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models. We do this using several detectors. The results on
diverse, multi-genre, and multi-lingual lyrics show generally strong detection
performance across languages and genres, particularly for our best-performing
model using Whisper large-v2 and LLM2Vec embeddings. In addition, we show that
our method is more robust than state-of-the-art audio-based ones when the audio
is perturbed in different ways and when evaluated on different music
generators. Our code is available at

Result: 实验表明，即使文本输入不完美，只要包含时间戳线索，LLM仍能有效生成完整标注的转录。

Conclusion: LLM在处理不完美提示时表现出鲁棒性，为语音不流畅性检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate detection of disfluencies in spoken language is crucial for
enhancing the performance of automatic speech and language processing systems,
as well as fostering the development of more inclusive speech and language
technologies. Leveraging the growing trend of large language models (LLMs) as
versatile learners capable of processing both lexical and non-lexical inputs
(e.g., audio and video), we propose a novel approach to transcribing
disfluencies as explicit tokens with timestamps, enabling the generation of
fully annotated disfluency-rich transcripts. Our method integrates acoustic
representations extracted from an audio encoder with textual inputs of varying
quality: clean transcriptions without disfluencies, time-aligned transcriptions
from aligners, or outputs from phoneme-based ASR models -- all of which may
contain imperfections. Importantly, our experiments demonstrate that textual
inputs do not need to be flawless. As long as they include timestamp-related
cues, LLMs can effectively smooth the input and produce fully
disfluency-annotated transcripts, underscoring their robustness in handling
imperfect hints.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized audio representations, yet
models often remain domain-specific, focusing on either speech or non-speech
tasks. In this work, we present Universal Speech and Audio Distillation (USAD),
a unified approach to audio representation learning that integrates diverse

Abstract: Music-driven dance generation has garnered significant attention due to its
wide range of industrial applications, particularly in the creation of group
choreography. During the group dance generation process, however, most existing
methods still face three primary issues: multi-dancer collisions, single-dancer
foot sliding and abrupt swapping in the generation of long group dance. In this
paper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to
generate harmonious group dance. Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer
collisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to better maintain the
relative positioning among dancers. Additionally, we incorporate a
distance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within
plausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we
introduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design
a Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For
long group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling
strategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional
information into the noisy input. Furthermore, we integrate a Sequence Decoder
layer to enhance the model's ability to selectively process long sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TCDiff++ achieves state-of-the-art
performance, particularly in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality and
coherent group dance generation.
