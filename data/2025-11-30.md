### [1] [Democratizing LLM Efficiency: From Hyperscale Optimizations to Universal Deployability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20662)
*Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable, but the most celebrated efficiency methods -- mixture-of-experts (MoE), speculative decoding, and complex retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- were built for hyperscale providers with vast infrastructure and elite teams. Outside that context, their benefits collapse into overhead, fragility, and wasted carbon. The result is that a handful of Big Tech companies benefit, while thousands of hospitals, schools, governments, and enterprises are left without viable options. We argue that the next frontier is not greater sophistication at scale, but robust simplicity: efficiency that thrives under modest resources and minimal expertise. We propose a new research agenda: retrofitting pretrained models with more efficient architectures without retraining, inventing lightweight fine-tuning that preserves alignment, making reasoning economical despite long chains of thought, enabling dynamic knowledge management without heavy RAG pipelines, and adopting Overhead-Aware Efficiency (OAE) as a standard benchmark. By redefining efficiency to include adoption cost, sustainability, and fairness, we can democratize LLM deployment -- ensuring that optimization reduces inequality and carbon waste rather than amplifying them.

### [2] [Harmonic Token Projection (HTP): A Vocabulary-Free, Training-Free, Deterministic, and Reversible Embedding Methodology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20665)
*Tcharlies Schmitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HTP是一种无需训练、词汇表或随机参数的可逆确定性文本嵌入框架，通过Unicode整数生成谐波轨迹来编码token，实现符号与向量空间的双射映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经嵌入依赖统计共现或优化方法，缺乏可解释性和可逆性。HTP旨在通过纯几何方法建立透明高效的语义表示。

Method: 将每个token的Unicode整数表示解析为谐波轨迹，生成相位一致的投影，保持结构和可逆性，通过几何对齐估计语义相似度。

Result: 在STS-B基准测试中达到Spearman相关性0.68，在10种语言中保持稳定性能，计算成本极低，每句对延迟亚毫秒级。

Conclusion: 有意义的语义关系可以从确定性几何中产生，为数据驱动嵌入提供了透明高效的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Harmonic Token Projection (HTP), a reversible and deterministic framework for generating text embeddings without training, vocabularies, or stochastic parameters. Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings. Keywords: Harmonic Token Projection, reversible embedding, deterministic encoding, semantic similarity, multilingual representation.

### [3] [A centroid based framework for text classification in itsm environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20667)
*Hossein Mohanna,Ali Ait-Bachir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于双嵌入质心的层次分类框架，在ITSM工单分类中实现与SVM相当的性能，同时提供可解释性和高效训练/更新


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ITSM系统中工单需要分类到树状层次结构，现有方法在可解释性和效率方面存在不足

Method: 双嵌入质心分类框架，为每个类别维护语义和词汇质心表示，通过互逆排序融合在推理时结合

Result: 在8,968个工单123个类别上，性能与SVM相当（层次F1: 0.731 vs 0.727），训练快5.9倍，增量更新快152倍，推理速度提升8.6-8.8倍

Conclusion: 该方法适合生产ITSM环境，在保持性能的同时提供可解释性和操作效率

Abstract: Text classification with hierarchical taxonomies is a fundamental requirement in IT Service Management (ITSM) systems, where support tickets must be categorized into tree-structured taxonomies. We present a dual-embedding centroid-based classification framework that maintains separate semantic and lexical centroid representations per category, combining them through reciprocal rank fusion at inference time. The framework achieves performance competitive with Support Vector Machines (hierarchical F1: 0.731 vs 0.727) while providing interpretability through centroid representations. Evaluated on 8,968 ITSM tickets across 123 categories, this method achieves 5.9 times faster training and up to 152 times faster incremental updates. With 8.6-8.8 times speedup across batch sizes (100-1000 samples) when excluding embedding computation. These results make the method suitable for production ITSM environments prioritizing interpretability and operational efficiency.

### [4] [PIRA: Preference-Oriented Instruction-Tuned Reward Models with Dual Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20668)
*Yongfu Xue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PIRA是一种新的奖励模型训练范式，通过将问答对重新表述为偏好指令、聚合多样化偏好任务的奖励、以及在不同dropout率下平均价值头输出来解决数据效率低和奖励过度优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统判别式奖励模型存在数据效率低和容易奖励过度优化的问题，需要更有效的训练方法。

Method: 采用三种策略：1) 将问答对重新表述为偏好指令；2) 聚合多样化偏好任务的奖励；3) 在不同dropout率下平均价值头输出。

Result: 大量实验证明了PIRA的有效性。

Conclusion: PIRA训练范式成功解决了奖励模型的数据效率低和奖励过度优化问题。

Abstract: Reward models are crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences but face two representative challenges. First, traditional discriminative reward models usually concatenate questions and responses directly as input, resulting in low data efficiency. Second, reward models are vulnerable to reward overoptimization. We propose PIRA, a training paradigm addressing these issues through three strategies: (1) Reformulating question-answer pairs into preference-based instructions for clearer and more explicit task specification, (2) aggregating rewards from diverse preference tasks to reduce bias and improve robustness, and (3) averaging value-head outputs under varying dropout rates to stabilize rewards. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of PIRA.

### [5] [Structured Definitions and Segmentations for Legal Reasoning in LLMs: A Study on Indian Legal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20669)
*Mann Khatri,Mirza Yusuf,Rajiv Ratn Shah,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何通过重组法律文档结构、定义修辞角色和模拟法院推理步骤来提升大语言模型在法律任务中的表现，在零样本设置下实现了1.5%-4.36%的F1分数提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然具备通用推理能力，但在法律等专业领域表现不佳，主要因为缺乏领域特定的预训练，且法律文档通常冗长复杂，难以高效处理。

Method: 在三个印度法律判决预测数据集上进行零样本实验：(1)基于修辞角色重组文档结构；(2)定义修辞角色以熟悉法律术语；(3)模拟法院关于修辞角色的逐步推理过程。

Result: 重组数据或解释关键法律术语显著提升了模型性能，相比基线F1分数最低提升约1.5%，最高提升4.36%。

Conclusion: 通过结构化信息处理和领域知识注入，可以有效提升大语言模型在法律专业任务中的表现，特别是在零样本设置下。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets from the web, exhibit remarkable general reasoning skills. Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.

### [6] [MindSET: Advancing Mental Health Benchmarking through Large-Scale Social Media Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20672)
*Saad Mankarious,Ayah Zirikly,Daniel Wiechmann,Elma Kerz,Edward Kempa,Yu Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MindSET基准数据集，包含1300万条标注的Reddit帖子，涵盖7种心理健康状况，通过严格预处理确保数据质量，在诊断检测任务中表现优于现有基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理健康分析基准数据集已过时，存在数据有限、清理不足、内容多样性等问题，需要新的高质量数据集来支持社交媒体心理健康研究。

Method: 从Reddit收集自报诊断数据，应用严格预处理（语言过滤、NSFW内容移除、去重），使用LIWC进行语言分析，并通过微调语言模型和词袋特征进行二元分类实验。

Result: MindSET数据集规模是之前基准的两倍以上，在诊断检测任务中比现有基准表现更好，自闭症检测的F1分数提高了18个百分点。

Conclusion: MindSET为社交媒体与心理健康交叉研究提供了坚实基础，支持早期风险检测和新兴心理趋势的深入分析。

Abstract: Social media data has become a vital resource for studying mental health, offering real-time insights into thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that traditional methods often miss. Progress in this area has been facilitated by benchmark datasets for mental health analysis; however, most existing benchmarks have become outdated due to limited data availability, inadequate cleaning, and the inherently diverse nature of social media content (e.g., multilingual and harmful material). We present a new benchmark dataset, \textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection. Overall, MindSET provides a robust foundation for researchers exploring the intersection of social media and mental health, supporting both early risk detection and deeper analysis of emerging psychological trends.

### [7] [Semantics Meet Signals: Dual Codebook Representationl Learning for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20673)
*Zheng Hui,Xiaokai Wei,Reza Shirkavand,Chen Wang,Weizhi Zhang,Alejandro Peláez,Michelle Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FlexCode是一个基于流行度感知的生成式推荐框架，通过动态分配协作过滤和语义编码本的固定token预算，解决了传统方法对热门和长尾项目使用统一编码的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐方法使用单一统一编码本编码所有项目，忽视了热门项目（富含协作信号）和长尾项目（依赖语义理解）之间的固有不平衡，这限制了表示效率和泛化能力。

Method: 引入FlexCode框架，自适应地在协作过滤编码本和语义编码本之间分配固定token预算；使用轻量级MoE动态平衡CF特定精度和语义泛化；通过对齐和平滑目标保持整个流行度谱系的连贯性。

Result: 在公共和工业规模数据集上的实验表明，FlexCode始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: FlexCode为生成式推荐器中的token表示提供了新机制，实现了更强的准确性和尾部鲁棒性，为基于token的推荐模型中平衡记忆和泛化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm that unifies retrieval and generation, representing items as discrete semantic tokens and enabling flexible sequence modeling with autoregressive models. Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines. FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders, achieving stronger accuracy and tail robustness, and offering a new perspective on balancing memorization and generalization in token-based recommendation models.

### [8] [Prompt Engineering Techniques for Context-dependent Text-to-SQL in Arabic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20677)
*Saleh Almohaimeed,May Alsofyani,Saad Almohaimeed,Mansour Al Ghanim,Liqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个阿拉伯语跨领域上下文依赖的text-to-SQL数据集Ar-SParC，包含3,450个相关问题和10,225个问题-SQL对，并提出了GAT corrector方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前text-to-SQL研究主要集中在英语和中文，阿拉伯语领域尚无相关工作，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建Ar-SParC数据集，使用GPT-3.5-turbo和GPT-4.5-turbo进行40个实验，应用10种提示工程技术，并开发了GAT corrector方法。

Result: GAT corrector在所有实验中平均提升了1.9%的执行准确率和1.9%的交互准确率（零样本设置），以及1.72%执行准确率和0.92%交互准确率（上下文学习设置）。

Conclusion: 成功创建了首个阿拉伯语text-to-SQL数据集，提出的GAT corrector方法有效提升了模型性能，特别适用于阿拉伯语言特性。

Abstract: In recent years, the task of cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL has received significant attention. Enables users with no prior knowledge of SQL to have a conversation with databases using natural language. However, most of the available datasets and research have been conducted in English, along with some work in Chinese. To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings. Finally, we conducted an ablation study with two more experiments to explain why the GAT corrector outperformed the previous GAT verifier technique, particularly for the Arabic language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个分层分类法来评估GPT-4在肿瘤学决策支持中的推理错误，发现23%的解读存在推理错误，这些错误与指南不一致且可能有害的临床建议相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在临床基准测试中表现良好，但它们可能通过错误的推理得出正确结论，这种失败模式在肿瘤学决策支持中具有安全影响，而基于准确性的评估无法捕捉到这一点。

Method: 使用CORAL数据集的乳腺癌和胰腺癌笔记，注释了600个推理轨迹来定义三层分类法，将计算失败映射到认知偏差框架。在822个前列腺癌咨询笔记的响应中验证了该分类法，模拟提取、分析和临床推荐任务。

Result: 23%的解读存在推理错误，确认偏差和锚定偏差最常见。推理失败与指南不一致和潜在有害的推荐相关，特别是在晚期疾病管理中。自动评估器可以检测错误存在但无法可靠分类子类型。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在推理存在缺陷时可能提供流畅但临床不安全的建议。该分类法为临床部署前评估和改进推理保真度提供了一个可推广的框架。

Abstract: Despite high performance on clinical benchmarks, large language models may reach correct conclusions through faulty reasoning, a failure mode with safety implications for oncology decision support that is not captured by accuracy-based evaluation. In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes. These findings show that large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed. The taxonomy provides a generalizable framework for evaluating and improving reasoning fidelity before clinical deployment.

### [10] [Dynamic Template Selection for Output Token Generation Optimization: MLP-Based and Transformer Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20683)
*Bharadwaj Yadavalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出动态模板选择(DTS)方法，根据查询复杂度自适应选择响应模板，在保持响应质量的同时显著降低token成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM部署采用统一的提示策略，对复杂分析任务和简单事实问题都使用冗长的响应模式，导致token效率低下，而输出token成本比输入token高4-8倍。

Method: 比较了两种路由方法：使用预计算嵌入的简单MLP和微调的RoBERTa变换器，在MMLU数据集上进行评估。

Result: MLP路由在测试数据上达到90.5%的路由准确率，略高于RoBERTa(89.5%)，且参数少1.25亿个。在三个主要LLM提供商上验证，token减少32.6%-33.9%。

Conclusion: DTS方法能有效降低LLM部署成本，路由决策在不同提供商间具有通用性，为token效率优化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Contemporary large language model deployments typically employ uniform prompting strategies across diverse query types, applying verbose response patterns to both complex analytical tasks and straightforward factual questions. This one-size-fits-all methodology leads to substantial token inefficiency, a concern amplified by the significant cost differential between input and output tokens--the latter commanding 4-8x higher prices across major providers. We present Dynamic Template Selection (DTS), which adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving significant cost reductions without compromising response quality.
  We compared two routing approaches: a simple MLP that uses pre-computed embeddings and a more complex fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer. Through comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 MMLU questions, we find that the MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy on held-out test data, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's performance (89.5%) despite utilizing 125M fewer parameters. Notably, our empirical analysis reveals provider-agnostic behavior in template selection--routing decisions generalize effectively across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude), as validated through 9,000 production API calls. While routing accuracy remains consistent at 90.5% across providers, observed token reductions vary from 32.6% to 33.9%, reflecting provider-specific generation characteristics.
  This work contributes several key elements: formal problem formulation with theoretical grounding in machine learning, four algorithms with corresponding complexity analyses, and extensive empirical validation across production systems.

TL;DR: 提出了多前缀记忆框架，通过评估不同前缀引出相同序列的能力来量化LLM的记忆程度，比单路径提取更全面可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆定义在全面捕捉对齐模型记忆现象方面存在不足，特别是无法区分深度编码的记忆内容和普通内容。

Method: 引入多前缀记忆框架，定义序列被记忆的条件是外部对抗搜索能找到足够多的不同前缀来引出该序列，从而量化记忆的鲁棒性。

Result: 在开源和对齐聊天模型上的实验表明，多前缀定义能可靠区分记忆和非记忆数据，为审计LLM数据泄露提供了实用工具。

Conclusion: 多前缀记忆框架提供了一个稳健实用的方法来评估LLM中的记忆现象，比现有方法更全面地捕捉数据泄露风险。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on massive corpora, are prone to verbatim memorization of training data, creating significant privacy and copyright risks. While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.

TL;DR: SAGE是一个基于代理的框架，将稀疏自编码器特征解释从被动单次生成任务转变为主动的、基于解释驱动的过程，通过系统制定多个解释、设计针对性实验和基于激活反馈迭代优化，显著提升了特征解释的生成和预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的内部机制仍然不透明，这对其安全可靠部署构成挑战。稀疏自编码器是分解LLM表示的有前途工具，但解释SAE捕获的特征仍然是一个困难任务。

Method: SAGE框架采用基于代理的方法，系统地为每个特征制定多个解释，设计针对性实验进行测试，并基于经验激活反馈迭代优化解释。

Result: 在不同语言模型的SAE特征上的实验表明，SAGE产生的解释在生成和预测准确性方面显著优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: SAGE通过将特征解释重构为主动的、解释驱动的过程，提供了一种更严谨和有效的方法来理解LLM的内部表示，为模型可解释性提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque, posing a significant challenge to their safe and reliable deployment. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for decomposing LLM representations into more interpretable features, but explaining the features captured by SAEs remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose SAGE (SAE AGentic Explainer), an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanation-driven process. SAGE implements a rigorous methodology by systematically formulating multiple explanations for each feature, designing targeted experiments to test them, and iteratively refining explanations based on empirical activation feedback. Experiments on features from SAEs of diverse language models demonstrate that SAGE produces explanations with significantly higher generative and predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanationdriven process.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DSPy+HELM框架，通过结构化提示方法改进语言模型评估，发现传统HELM基准会低估模型性能4%，导致排名错误，而引入推理能减少对提示设计的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型评估框架（如HELM）使用固定提示，无法准确估计各模型的上限性能，可能导致性能低估和部署决策错误。需要可扩展的方法来更准确地评估模型性能。

Method: 开发了可复现的DSPy+HELM框架，使用四种结构化提示方法（包括思维链推理），在七个基准测试上评估四个前沿语言模型，并与HELM基线进行比较。

Result: 发现：1）HELM平均低估性能4%；2）跨基准性能估计差异更大（标准差+2%）；3）3/7基准上的排行榜排名翻转；4）引入推理能降低对提示设计的敏感性。

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模实证研究，表明可扩展的性能上限估计能提供更有决策价值的基准测试，开源了DSPy+HELM集成和提示优化管道。

Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly adopted across domains, high-quality benchmarking frameworks that accurately estimate performance are essential for guiding deployment decisions. While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller Δ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks.

### [15] [Length-MAX Tokenizer for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20849)
*Dong Dong,Weijie Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Length-MAX分词器，通过最小化平均字符token数来减少训练和推理时的token数量，相比BPE在多种词汇量下减少13-18%的token，显著提升训练效率和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分词器如BPE主要基于频率优化，但未充分考虑token长度对效率的影响。本文旨在通过优化平均token长度来提高语言模型的训练和推理效率。

Method: 将长度加权目标最大化建模为图划分问题，开发贪心近似算法获得词汇表，最小化平均字符token数。

Result: 在10K-50K词汇量下比BPE减少14-18%的token；GPT-2模型训练步数减少17-18.5%，推理延迟降低12.7-13.7%，下游任务性能提升（LAMBADA困惑度降低11.7%，HellaSwag准确率提升4.3%）。

Conclusion: 优化平均token长度而非仅频率是提高语言模型效率的有效方法，在不牺牲性能的情况下显著提升训练和推理效率，兼容生产系统并减少18%的内存使用。

Abstract: We introduce a new tokenizer for language models that minimizes the average tokens per character, thereby reducing the number of tokens needed to represent text during training and to generate text during inference. Our method, which we refer to as the Length-MAX tokenizer, obtains its vocabulary by casting a length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and developing a greedy approximation algorithm. On FineWeb and diverse domains, it yields 14--18\% fewer tokens than Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) across vocabulary sizes from 10K to 50K, and the reduction is 13.0\% when the size is 64K. Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\%, 17.2\%, and 18.5\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\%, 12.7\%, and 13.7\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance. The tokenizer is compatible with production systems and reduces embedding and KV-cache memory by 18\% at inference.

TL;DR: 提出了Evo-Memory基准框架，用于评估LLM代理的自进化记忆能力，重点关注在连续任务流中记忆的检索、整合和更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注静态对话场景，忽视了LLM在连续任务流中积累和重用经验的动态能力，而现实世界环境需要LLM能够从累积交互中学习。

Method: 构建了顺序任务流数据集，统一实现了十多个代表性记忆模块，提出了ExpRAG基准方法和ReMem行动-思考-记忆优化流水线。

Result: 在10个多样化多轮目标导向和单轮推理问答数据集上评估了记忆模块的性能。

Conclusion: Evo-Memory填补了LLM代理自进化记忆评估的空白，为测试时记忆演化提供了系统框架。

Abstract: Statefulness is essential for large language model (LLM) agents to perform long-term planning and problem-solving. This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets. To better benchmark experience reuse, we provide a baseline method, ExpRAG, for retrieving and utilizing prior experience, and further propose ReMem, an action-think-memory refine pipeline that tightly integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates to achieve continual improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文采用跨语言方法进行低资源语言的论元挖掘，通过三种训练场景（零样本迁移、LLM增强、跨语言混合）在英语和波斯语上进行实验，发现轻量级跨语言混合模型性能最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在论元挖掘任务中数据不足的问题，探索有效的跨语言迁移方法。

Method: 构建三种训练场景：零样本迁移（仅用英语数据）、LLM增强（英语数据+LLM生成样本）、跨语言混合（英语数据+人工翻译波斯语句子），在英语和波斯语语料上评估。

Result: 零样本迁移模型在英语和波斯语测试集上的F1分数分别为50.2%和50.7%；LLM增强模型提升至59.2%和69.3%；跨语言混合模型在波斯语测试集上达到74.8%的F1分数。

Conclusion: 轻量级跨语言混合方法优于资源密集的增强方法，为低资源语言的论元挖掘任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of natural language processing to identify and extract the argument components, like premises and conclusions, within a text and to recognize the relations between them. It reveals the logical structure of texts to be used in tasks like knowledge extraction. This paper aims at utilizing a cross-lingual approach to argument mining for low-resource languages, by constructing three training scenarios. We examine the models on English, as a high-resource language, and Persian, as a low-resource language. To this end, we evaluate the models based on the English Microtext corpus \citep{PeldszusStede2015}, and its parallel Persian translation. The learning scenarios are as follow: (i) zero-shot transfer, where the model is trained solely with the English data, (ii) English-only training enhanced by synthetic examples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) a cross-lingual model that combines the original English data with manually translated Persian sentences. The zero-shot transfer model attains F1 scores of 50.2\% on the English test set and 50.7\% on the Persian test set. LLM-based augmentation model improves the performance up to 59.2\% on English and 69.3\% on Persian. The cross-lingual model, trained on both languages but evaluated solely on the Persian test set, surpasses the LLM-based variant, by achieving a F1 of 74.8\%. Results indicate that a lightweight cross-lingual blend can outperform considerably the more resource-intensive augmentation pipelines, and it offers a practical pathway for the argument mining task to overcome data resource shortage on low-resource languages.

*Nura Aljaafari,Danilo S. Carvalho,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合角色交叉最小对、时间涌现分析和跨模型比较的方法，研究LLMs如何实现语义角色，发现LLMs形成紧凑、因果隔离的抽象语义结构机制，这些机制在不同规模和架构间存在部分传递。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型显示出语义能力，但其实现抽象语义结构的内在机制仍不够清晰，需要更深入地表征这些内部机制。

Method: 整合角色交叉最小对、时间涌现分析和跨模型比较的方法来研究LLMs如何实现语义角色。

Result: 发现：(i)高度集中的电路（89-94%归因于28个节点内）；(ii)渐进式结构细化而非相变，较大模型有时绕过局部化电路；(iii)中等程度的跨尺度守恒（24-59%组件重叠）以及高光谱相似性。

Conclusion: LLMs形成紧凑、因果隔离的抽象语义结构机制，这些机制在不同规模和架构间表现出部分传递性。

Abstract: Despite displaying semantic competence, large language models' internal mechanisms that ground abstract semantic structure remain insufficiently characterised. We propose a method integrating role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to study how LLMs implement semantic roles. Our analysis uncovers: (i) highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes); (ii) gradual structural refinement rather than phase transitions, with larger models sometimes bypassing localised circuits; and (iii) moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% component overlap) alongside high spectral similarity. These findings suggest that LLMs form compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure, and these mechanisms exhibit partial transfer across scales and architectures.

*Reham Omar,Abdelghny Orogat,Ibrahim Abdelaziz,Omij Mangukiya,Panos Kalnis,Essam Mansour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chatty-KG是一个用于知识图谱对话问答的多智能体系统，结合了检索增强生成和结构化查询执行，在单轮和多轮问答中都显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有KGQA系统在多轮对话中上下文跟踪困难、延迟高、无法处理指代消解等问题，以及RAG系统在序列化图结构方面的局限性。

Method: 采用模块化多智能体架构，通过专门的任务智能体进行上下文解释、对话跟踪、实体关系链接和高效查询规划，将自然语言问题转换为可执行的SPARQL查询。

Result: 在多样化的知识图谱上显著优于现有最优方法，在单轮和多轮设置中都获得了更高的F1和P@1分数，延迟低且兼容多种LLM。

Conclusion: Chatty-KG统一了对话灵活性和结构化知识图谱基础，为可靠的多轮KGQA提供了可扩展和可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) combines the factual grounding of KG-based QA with the interactive nature of dialogue systems. KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.

*Ioana Buhnila,Aman Sinha,Mathieu Constant*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在定义类查询中表现最佳，但在示例类查询中表现最差，且对高频知识更容易进行释义，对低频技术知识则较少释义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在除定义类查询外的其他类型查询（如示例、释义等）中的性能下降，并研究预训练数据对LLMs回答多样语言查询的影响。

Method: 使用TrackList细粒度语言和统计分析流程，引入RefoMed-EN数据集（6170个人工标注的医学术语及其定义、命名、示例、解释或释义），评估概念频率（高频/低频）对LLM性能的影响，使用句法和语义相似度指标、统计相关性和嵌入来评估输出质量。

Result: LLMs在定义类问题上的任务性能最高，而在示例类问题上最低；对于定义类问题，LLMs更倾向于对流行和频繁的知识进行释义，而对尾部和技术知识，尤其是在专业文本中，则较少释义。

Conclusion: LLMs在处理非定义类查询时性能显著下降，且对高频知识的处理优于低频技术知识，揭示了预训练数据分布对模型性能的影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven efficient in giving definition-type answers to user input queries. While for humans giving various types of answers, such as examples and paraphrases, is an easy task, LLMs struggle to provide correct answers for other than definition-type queries. In this study, we evaluated this drop in performance using TrackList, a fine-grained linguistic and statistical analysis pipeline to investigate the impact of the pre-training data on LLMs answers to diverse linguistic queries. We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest. Additionally, we showed that for definition-type questions, large language models are prone to paraphrase more on popular and frequent knowledge and less on tail and technical knowledge, especially in the expert texts.

### [21] [Semantic Anchors in In-Context Learning: Why Small LLMs Cannot Flip Their Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21038)
*Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，上下文学习(ICL)无法覆盖预训练的标签语义，而是主要调整输入如何投影到预训练期间学习的稳定语义方向上，澄清了少样本提示的基本限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究上下文学习是否能覆盖预训练的标签语义，还是仅仅细化现有的语义主干。

Method: 将LLMs视为提示诱导分类器，对比自然演示（正确标签）和反转演示（系统翻转标签含义）下的行为，分解ICL行为为三个对齐指标（真值、先验和提示对齐），并引入语义覆盖率。

Result: 在8个分类任务和8个开源LLM上发现一致证据支持语义锚定观点。ICL提高准确性同时保持强先验对齐；大多数正确预测与零样本行为一致。反转演示下模型无法学习连贯的反语义分类器，语义覆盖率在少样本1-12B设置中保持为零。

Conclusion: ICL主要调整输入如何投影到预训练期间学习的稳定语义方向上，而非灵活重映射标签含义，澄清了少样本提示的基本限制，表明在这些规模上覆盖标签语义需要超越ICL的干预措施。

Abstract: Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合检索上下文信息的讽刺检测方法，通过非参数知识检索和自知识检索两种策略，显著提升了大型语言模型在讽刺检测任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺检测在自然语言处理中仍然具有挑战性，现有的预训练语言模型和大型语言模型在处理复杂讽刺文本时，由于语言多样性和文化差异，以及缺乏必要背景知识，检测效果不稳定。

Method: 基于Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting方法，引入检索感知方法，通过两种互补方式提供上下文：非参数知识检索（基于网络检索）和自知识检索（激发模型内部知识）。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，非参数检索在Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic数据集上比原始PMP方法提升了9.87%的macro-F1分数；自知识检索在Semeval和MUStARD数据集上分别提升了3.29%和4.08%的macro-F1分数。

Conclusion: 上下文信息对于提升LLMs在讽刺检测任务中的性能至关重要，特别是涉及文化特定俚语、引用或LLMs未知术语时。未来工作将优化相关上下文信息的检索并研究检索质量对性能的影响。

Abstract: Detecting sarcasm remains a challenging task in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) despite recent advances in neural network approaches. Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance. The experiment code is available at: https://github.com/wllchrst/sarcasm-detection_pmp_knowledge-base.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探索在缅甸语等低资源语言分类任务中使用KANs（Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks）替代传统MLPs作为分类头，实验表明KANs在性能上具有竞争力或更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源语言如缅甸语中，分类任务通常只微调最终分类层而保持预训练编码器权重冻结。传统MLPs的固定非线性可能限制表达能力并增加计算成本。

Method: 评估了三种KAN变体（FourierKAN、EfficientKAN、FasterKAN）作为分类头，使用多种嵌入方法包括TF-IDF、fastText和多语言transformer（mBERT、Distil-mBERT）。

Result: EfficientKAN与fastText组合获得最高F1分数（0.928）；在transformer嵌入上，EfficientKAN与mBERT匹配或略优于MLPs（0.917 F1）；FasterKAN在速度和准确性之间提供最佳平衡。

Conclusion: KANs是MLPs在低资源语言分类任务中表达能力强、效率高的替代方案。

Abstract: In low-resource languages like Burmese, classification tasks often fine-tune only the final classification layer, keeping pre-trained encoder weights frozen. While Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are commonly used, their fixed non-linearity can limit expressiveness and increase computational cost. This work explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as alternative classification heads, evaluating Fourier-based FourierKAN, Spline-based EfficientKAN, and Grid-based FasterKAN-across diverse embeddings including TF-IDF, fastText, and multilingual transformers (mBERT, Distil-mBERT). Experimental results show that KAN-based heads are competitive with or superior to MLPs. EfficientKAN with fastText achieved the highest F1-score (0.928), while FasterKAN offered the best trade-off between speed and accuracy. On transformer embeddings, EfficientKAN matched or slightly outperformed MLPs with mBERT (0.917 F1). These findings highlight KANs as expressive, efficient alternatives to MLPs for low-resource language classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统评估不同架构大语言模型在硬性拼写约束文本生成任务上的表现，填补跨架构比较研究的空白。

Method: 使用58个单词谜题评估28种配置，涵盖三个模型家族（Qwen3、Claude Haiku-4.5、GPT-5-mini），分析架构差异、参数缩放和思考预算的影响。

Result: 架构差异产生2.0-2.2倍的性能差距，参数缩放仅带来83%增益；高容量模型对思考预算敏感，中等模型趋于饱和；模型在拼写异常词汇上失败率高达89-96%。

Conclusion: 约束满足需要专门的架构特征或训练目标，而不仅仅是参数或计算预算的扩展，模型过度依赖分布合理性而惩罚拼写异常但约束有效的模式。

Abstract: Large language models must satisfy hard orthographic constraints during controlled text generation, yet systematic cross-architecture evaluation remains limited. We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography ("data", "poop", "loll": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate). These failures reveal over-reliance on distributional plausibility that penalizes orthographically atypical but constraint-valid patterns, suggesting architectural innovations may be required beyond simply scaling parameters or computational budgets.

Conclusion: AEC方法在低资源缅甸语ASR中表现出鲁棒性，特征设计对于提升ASR输出质量至关重要，为低资源语言的ASR错误校正提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates sequence-to-sequence Transformer models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction in low-resource Burmese, focusing on different feature integration strategies including IPA and alignment information. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing ASR error correction specifically for Burmese. We evaluate five ASR backbones and show that our ASR Error Correction (AEC) approaches consistently improve word- and character-level accuracy over baseline outputs. The proposed AEC model, combining IPA and alignment features, reduced the average WER of ASR models from 51.56 to 39.82 before augmentation (and 51.56 to 43.59 after augmentation) and improving chrF++ scores from 0.5864 to 0.627, demonstrating consistent gains over the baseline ASR outputs without AEC. Our results highlight the robustness of AEC and the importance of feature design for improving ASR outputs in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.

Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.

*Steven Wang,Kyle Hunt,Shaojie Tang,Kenneth Joseph*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，在少量人类调查数据上微调LLM可以改善模拟结果的异质性、对齐性和信念-行为一致性，但即使最佳微调模型也无法复现原始研究的回归系数，因此LLM生成的数据仍不适合替代人类参与者进行正式推断分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨是否通过在少量人类调查数据（如试点研究数据）上微调LLM，能够缓解LLM在模拟人类行为时表现出的多样性有限、少数群体系统性偏差、组内方差不足以及信念与行为不一致等问题。

Method: 使用信息披露行为实验，从分布差异、子群体对齐、信念-行为一致性和回归系数恢复等多个维度比较人类和LLM生成的响应。

Result: 在少量人类样本上微调显著改善了基础模型的异质性、对齐性和信念-行为一致性，但即使最佳微调模型也无法复现原始研究的回归系数。

Conclusion: LLM生成的数据仍不适合替代人类参与者进行正式推断分析，尽管微调能在某些方面改善模拟效果。

Abstract: There is ongoing debate about whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as substitutes for human participants in survey and experimental research. While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文开发了首个伊森语（泰国最广泛使用的地区方言）开放对话语音数据集，包含自然语音而非朗读语音，捕捉了真实的语言现象如口语化表达、自发韵律、不流利和频繁的泰语代码转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音语料库主要基于朗读或脚本语音，缺乏自然对话数据。伊森语缺乏标准化正字法，书写实践差异大，这给转录指南设计带来挑战，需要平衡表征准确性和计算处理需求。

Method: 建立实用的转录协议，在表征准确性和计算处理需求之间取得平衡，开发包含自然语音的对话数据集。

Result: 成功创建了首个伊森语开放对话语音数据集，包含自然语音特征如口语化表达、自发韵律、不流利和代码转换。

Conclusion: 通过发布这个开放数据集，旨在促进包容性AI发展，支持对代表性不足语言的研究，并为解决对话语音建模中的语言和技术挑战提供基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces the development of the first open conversational speech dataset for the Isan language, the most widely spoken regional dialect in Thailand. Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing. By releasing this dataset as an open resource, we aim to contribute to inclusive AI development, support research on underrepresented languages, and provide a basis for addressing the linguistic and technical challenges inherent in modeling conversational speech.

TL;DR: PEFT-Bench是一个统一的端到端基准测试，用于评估自回归大语言模型上的多种参数高效微调方法，包含27个NLP数据集和6种PEFT方法，并提出了考虑训练参数、推理速度和训练内存使用的PSCP指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在许多任务上取得了最先进的性能，但其巨大规模导致高计算和环境成本，限制了可访问性。当前PEFT方法的评估仍然有限且难以复现。

Method: 开发了PEFT-Bench基准测试框架，在27个NLP数据集和6种PEFT方法上进行评估，并提出了PSCP指标来综合考虑训练参数、推理速度和训练内存使用。

Result: 论文展示了PEFT-Bench的使用方法，但具体结果未在摘要中详细说明。

Conclusion: PEFT-Bench填补了当前PEFT方法评估的空白，提供了一个统一且可复现的评估框架，有助于更全面地比较不同PEFT方法的性能。

Abstract: Despite the state-of-the-art performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) achieved on many tasks, their massive scale often leads to high computational and environmental costs, limiting their accessibility. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong downstream performance. Despite the increased development in PEFT methods, current evaluations remain limited (in terms of evaluated models and datasets) and difficult to reproduce. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEFT-Bench, a unified end-to-end benchmark for evaluating diverse PEFT methods on autoregressive LLMs. We demonstrate its usage across 27 NLP datasets and 6 PEFT methods. To account for different PEFT training and inference factors, we also introduce the PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric, which takes trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory usage into account.

*Kai Kugler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了神经网络语言模型训练过程中生成的文本是否遵循Martin定律（词频与多义性关系）。研究发现该定律在训练过程中呈现非单调发展轨迹，存在最佳语义窗口。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络语言模型在训练过程中是否能够自发地学习到人类语言中的统计规律，特别是Martin定律所描述的词频与多义性关系。

Method: 使用DBSCAN聚类上下文嵌入作为词义操作化方法，分析四个Pythia模型（70M-1B参数）在30个训练检查点上的表现。

Result: Martin定律在检查点100左右出现，在检查点104达到峰值相关性（r > 0.6），然后在检查点105退化。小模型在后期检查点经历灾难性语义崩溃，而大模型则表现出优雅退化。频率-特异性权衡在所有模型中保持稳定（r ≈ -0.3）。

Conclusion: 语言模型生成文本对语言规律性的遵循并非随训练单调增加，而是遵循平衡轨迹，存在最佳语义窗口。这为评估神经网络语言模型中涌现的语言结构建立了新方法。

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of Martin's Law - the empirical relationship between word frequency and polysemy - in text generated by neural language models during training. Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation. The frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r $\approx$ -0.3) across all models. These findings suggest that compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text is not monotonically increasing with training, but instead follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window. This work establishes a novel methodology for evaluating emergent linguistic structure in neural language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Lindsey研究中提出的开放性问题：是否可以通过训练消除跨模型差异，直接诱导内省行为，为AI透明度提供途径。

Method: 通过对瞬态单token注入进行微调训练，使模型能够检测、保留并报告注入的语义内容。

Result: 模型从0.4%准确率提升到85%准确率，假阳性率为0%，能够泛化到未见过的概念向量，学习到可迁移的技能。

Conclusion: 至少有一种内省行为成分可以直接通过训练诱导，为构建内置AI透明度提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Lindsey (2025) investigates introspective awareness in language models through four experiments, finding that models can sometimes detect and identify injected activation patterns -- but unreliably (~20% success in the best model). We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected "thoughts" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at α=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting "thoughts" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether "training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences." We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.

TL;DR: 本文研究了捷克语和斯洛伐克语声明的细粒度证据提取任务，创建了新的数据集并评估了大型语言模型在此任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线新闻文章下的用户评论中经常传播错误信息，需要有效的方法来检测事实错误信息。为了支持或反驳这些评论中的声明，需要识别相关文档并精确定位证明或反驳每个声明的确切文本片段。

Method: 创建了由付费标注人员标注的细粒度证据数据集，并评估了多种大型语言模型（LLMs）在该数据集上的表现，分析其与人工标注的一致性。

Result: LLMs经常无法从源文本中逐字复制证据，导致无效输出。llama3.1:8b模型尽管规模较小但正确输出比例较高，而gpt-oss-120b模型尽管参数更多但表现不佳。qwen3:14b、deepseek-r1:32b和gpt-oss:20b模型在模型大小与人工标注一致性之间达到了有效平衡。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在细粒度证据提取任务中经常无法准确复制源文本证据，模型大小与性能之间没有简单的正相关关系，某些中等规模模型在性能与效率之间达到了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Misinformation frequently spreads in user comments under online news articles, highlighting the need for effective methods to detect factually incorrect information. To strongly support or refute claims extracted from such comments, it is necessary to identify relevant documents and pinpoint the exact text spans that justify or contradict each claim. This paper focuses on the latter task -- fine-grained evidence extraction for Czech and Slovak claims. We create new dataset, containing two-way annotated fine-grained evidence created by paid annotators. We evaluate large language models (LLMs) on this dataset to assess their alignment with human annotations. The results reveal that LLMs often fail to copy evidence verbatim from the source text, leading to invalid outputs. Error-rate analysis shows that the {llama3.1:8b model achieves a high proportion of correct outputs despite its relatively small size, while the gpt-oss-120b model underperforms despite having many more parameters. Furthermore, the models qwen3:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, and gpt-oss:20b demonstrate an effective balance between model size and alignment with human annotations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSR-SQL是一个双状态推理框架，通过自适应上下文状态和渐进生成状态的交互来解决复杂企业数据库中的Text-to-SQL问题，无需后训练或上下文示例即可达到竞争性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分治推理方法在处理复杂企业数据库时，由于上下文容量有限、模式链接不可靠和数据库语义基础薄弱，难以保持连贯推理。

Method: DSR-SQL将Text-to-SQL建模为自适应上下文状态和渐进生成状态之间的交互。前者通过精炼大型模式并选择相关结构来构建紧凑的语义忠实环境；后者将SQL合成形式化为反馈引导的状态转换，使模型能够自我纠正并与用户意图对齐。

Result: 在Spider 2.0-Snow上达到35.28%的执行准确率，在BIRD开发集上达到68.32%的执行准确率。

Conclusion: DSR-SQL框架有效解决了复杂企业数据库中的Text-to-SQL挑战，通过双状态推理机制实现了竞争性的性能表现。

Abstract: Recent divide-and-conquer reasoning approaches, particularly those based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT), have substantially improved the Text-to-SQL capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when applied to complex enterprise databases, such methods struggle to maintain coherent reasoning due to limited context capacity, unreliable schema linking, and weak grounding in database semantics. To overcome these issues, we introduce DSR-SQL, a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tate \textbf{R}easoning framework that models Text-to-SQL as an interaction between an adaptive context state and a progressive generation state. The first constructs a compact, semantically faithful environment by refining large schemas and selecting relevant structures, while the second formalizes SQL synthesis as feedback-guided state transitions, enabling the model to self-correct and align with user intent. Without any post-training or in-context examples, DSR-SQL achieves competitive performance, reaching 35.28\% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32\% on BIRD development set. Our implementation will be open-sourced at: https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group/DSR-SQL.

TL;DR: Odin是一个新的架构，通过定向双模块机制在特定Transformer层注入图结构，避免了GNN的过平滑问题和Transformer忽略图拓扑的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖GNN（受限于过平滑和跳数依赖扩散），要么使用Transformer（忽略图拓扑并将节点视为孤立序列），需要一种能有效结合文本理解和结构推理的方法。

Method: 提出Odin架构，在选定深度的Transformer层通过定向双模块机制注入图结构，不依赖多跳扩散，而是在特定层整合多跳结构，产生与语义层次对齐的低、中、高级结构抽象。

Result: 在多个文本丰富图基准测试中，Odin实现了最先进的准确性，而轻量版Light Odin以显著降低的计算成本提供了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Odin和Light Odin形成了一个统一的、无跳数的框架，用于原则性的结构-文本集成，其表达能力严格包含纯Transformer和GNN。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs require models to effectively combine strong textual understanding with structurally informed reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration. The source code of this model has been released at https://github.com/hongkaifeng/Odin.

Motivation: 模型融合可以在不额外训练的情况下组合多个精调检查点，但现有方法在小模型和分类器上的优势是否适用于LLM尚不明确。

Method: 大规模系统评估六种最先进的融合方法，包括子空间方法，涵盖四个开源LLM、每个基础模型十二个精调检查点和十六个标准LLM基准。

Result: Task Arithmetic是唯一能可靠获得性能提升的方法，其他干扰感知和子空间融合方法通常导致显著性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前融合技术不能直接迁移到现代LLM，需要设计LLM特定的融合算法和融合感知的精调方法。

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned checkpoints into a single model without additional training, offering an attractive approach to reusing models and efficiently improving performance. However, it remains unclear whether the advantages reported for smaller models and classifiers generalize to LLMs. We present a large-scale, systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods, including recent subspace methods, across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks. Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods. Code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在可读性评估中大多忽略了文本长度或可读性标签的序数关系，需要更全面的评估机制。

Method: 使用双向可读性评估机制识别语义丰富区域预测句子级可读性，结合成对排序算法通过标签减法建模可读性级别的序数关系。

Conclusion: 提出的双向可读性评估机制和成对排序算法能够有效提升可读性评估的准确性，考虑了文本长度和标签序数关系。

Abstract: Readability assessment aims to evaluate the reading difficulty of a text. In recent years, while deep learning technology has been gradually applied to readability assessment, most approaches fail to consider either the length of the text or the ordinal relationship of readability labels. This paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment mechanism that captures contextual information to identify regions with rich semantic information in the text, thereby predicting the readability level of individual sentences. These sentence-level labels are then used to assist in predicting the overall readability level of the document. Additionally, a pairwise sorting algorithm is introduced to model the ordinal relationship between readability levels through label subtraction. Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance and outperforms other baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音翻译中，当从有概念性性别的语言翻译到语法性别语言时，说话者的声学特征可能在性别分配中起作用，这可能导致错误性别识别。目前对语音翻译模型如何做出这些决策的理解还很有限。

Method: 研究三个语言对（英-西/法/意）中语音翻译模型为说话者指称术语分配性别的机制，考察训练数据模式、内部语言模型偏见和声学信息的相互作用，使用对比性特征归因分析频谱图。

Result: 模型不简单复制训练数据中的术语特定性别关联，而是学习更广泛的男性主导模式。内部语言模型表现出强烈的男性偏见，但模型能够基于声学输入覆盖这些偏好。高准确率模型通过第一人称代词将性别化术语与说话者关联，利用分布在频率谱而非集中在音高上的性别信息。

Conclusion: 语音翻译模型发展出复杂机制来处理性别分配，能够整合声学线索来覆盖内部语言模型偏见，并揭示了一种新的基于第一人称代词和分布频率信息的性别识别机制。

Abstract: Unlike text, speech conveys information about the speaker, such as gender, through acoustic cues like pitch. This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.

TL;DR: RoParQ是一个专门评估闭卷多选题问答中跨释义一致性的基准，通过生成释义并筛选不一致样本来构建。提出了XParaCon评估指标和基于推理的释义感知SFT策略，显著提升了模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在回答释义问题时经常表现出不一致行为，表明其依赖表层模式而非真正的语义理解。需要解决这一局限性以提升模型可靠性。

Method: 从标准数据集生成释义，通过法官模型筛选不一致样本构建RoParQ基准；提出XParaCon评估指标；实施基于推理的释义感知监督微调策略。

Result: 经过针对性对齐后，模型鲁棒性显著增强。微调后的轻量级模型达到了与更大预训练模型相当的致性水平。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了表层记忆问题，促进了更鲁棒可靠的大语言模型发展，展示了针对性对齐策略的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit inconsistent behavior when answering paraphrased questions, suggesting a reliance on surface-level patterns rather than true semantic understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce RoParQ, a benchmark specifically constructed to evaluate cross-paraphrase consistency in closed-book multiple-choice QA. This benchmark is derived from standard datasets by generating paraphrases via proprietary models and selectively retaining examples that elicit inconsistent confidence from a judge model. We further propose XParaCon, a novel evaluation metric that quantifies a model's robustness by measuring the standard deviation of accuracies across question variants. Additionally, we implement a reasoning-based, paraphrase-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy designed to align models toward semantic invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted alignment significantly enhances robustness. Notably, fine-tuned lightweight models achieved consistency levels comparable to much larger pre-trained models. These results highlight the efficacy of our approach in mitigating superficial memorization and fostering more robust, reliable LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单、轻量且广泛适用的途径来理解大语言模型的内部机制，特别是在复杂多技能场景中识别特定技能编码的神经元。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. In this paper, we introduce a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable method with a focus on isolating neurons that encode specific skills. Building upon prior work that identified "skill neurons" via soft prompt training on classification tasks, our approach extends the analysis to complex scenarios involving multiple skills. We correlate neuron activations with auxiliary metrics -- such as external labels and the model's own confidence score -- thereby uncovering interpretable and task-specific behaviors without the need for manual token aggregation. We empirically validate our method on tasks spanning open-ended text generation and natural language inference, demonstrating its ability to detect neurons that not only drive known skills but also reveal previously unidentified shortcuts in arithmetic reasoning on BigBench.

*Dongyang Fan,Diba Hashemi,Sai Praneeth Karimireddy,Martin Jaggi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现除了URL外，其他元数据类型（如文档质量指标）也能加速LLM预训练，关键在于元数据需要提供细粒度信息。提出了元数据追加和可学习元标记的方法来提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究仅关注URL作为元数据，但其他元数据类型是否也能加速预训练仍未知，需要探索更广泛的元数据类型及其效果。

Method: 研究多种元数据类型，引入元数据追加方法（将元数据作为辅助任务预测），使用可学习元标记配合掩码损失，并通过探针分析潜在表示。

Result: 发现细粒度元数据（如文档质量指标）能有效加速预训练，元数据追加和可学习元标记都能提升训练效率，元数据能塑造质量感知的潜在结构。

Conclusion: 提供了整合元数据以提升LLM预训练效率和效果的实用指南，细粒度元数据是加速训练的关键特征。

Abstract: Incorporating metadata in Large Language Models (LLMs) pretraining has recently emerged as a promising approach to accelerate training. However prior work highlighted only one useful signal-URLs, leaving open the question of whether other forms of metadata could yield greater benefits. In this study, we investigate a wider range of metadata types and find other types of metadata, such as fine-grained indicators of document quality that can also accelerate pretraining when prepended. We identify a common feature among effective metadata: they encode information at a finer granularity. We further introduce metadata appending as a means of improving training efficiency, where predicting an appropriate metadata as auxiliary task can help speed up pretraining. In addition, learnable meta-tokens trained with masked loss can recover part of the speedup by inducing quality-aware latent structure. Using probing, we analyze latent representations to understand how metadata shapes learning. Together, these results yield practical guidelines for integrating metadata to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pretraining.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 捷克母语者难以区分AI生成和人类创作的诗歌，准确率仅45.8%。虽然AI诗歌质量与人类相当甚至更好，但读者一旦认为是AI创作就会给予更低评价，存在明显的作者偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究捷克语AI生成诗歌的感知，因为大多数AI诗歌研究集中在英语，而捷克语作为形态复杂、训练数据较少的斯拉夫语言，其AI诗歌创作能力值得探究。

Method: 让捷克母语者识别AI和人类创作的诗歌作者，并进行美学评价，使用逻辑回归模型分析识别准确率与美学评价的关系。

Result: 参与者识别准确率接近随机水平（45.8%），AI诗歌与人类诗歌难以区分。美学评价显示作者偏见：被认为AI创作的诗歌评分更低，尽管AI诗歌实际评分相当或更高。喜欢程度越高，准确识别作者的概率越低。

Conclusion: AI能够令人信服地创作捷克诗歌，即使是在形态复杂、训练数据较少的语言中。读者的作者信念与诗歌美学评价密切相关。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly capable of producing creative texts, yet most studies on AI-generated poetry focus on English -- a language that dominates training data. In this paper, we examine the perception of AI- and human-written Czech poetry. We ask if Czech native speakers are able to identify it and how they aesthetically judge it. Participants performed at chance level when guessing authorship (45.8\% correct on average), indicating that Czech AI-generated poems were largely indistinguishable from human-written ones. Aesthetic evaluations revealed a strong authorship bias: when participants believed a poem was AI-generated, they rated it as less favorably, even though AI poems were in fact rated equally or more favorably than human ones on average. The logistic regression model uncovered that the more the people liked a poem, the less probable was that they accurately assign the authorship. Familiarity with poetry or literary background had no effect on recognition accuracy. Our findings show that AI can convincingly produce poetry even in a morphologically complex, low-resource (with respect of the training data of AI models) Slavic language such as Czech. The results suggest that readers' beliefs about authorship and the aesthetic evaluation of the poem are interconnected.

TL;DR: Matrix是一个去中心化的多智能体框架，用于高效生成合成数据，通过分布式队列实现控制流和数据流，相比集中式编排器实现了2-15倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体合成框架依赖集中式编排器导致可扩展性瓶颈，或者针对特定领域硬编码限制了灵活性。

Method: 采用去中心化设计，将控制流和数据流表示为通过分布式队列传递的序列化消息，消除中央编排器，使用Ray框架支持数万个并发智能体工作流。

Result: 在多智能体协作对话、基于网络的推理数据提取和客户服务环境中的工具使用轨迹生成等场景中，在相同硬件资源下实现了2-15倍的数据生成吞吐量提升，且不牺牲输出质量。

Conclusion: Matrix框架通过去中心化设计有效解决了多智能体合成数据的可扩展性和灵活性挑战，为各种数据生成工作流提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic data has become increasingly important for training large language models, especially when real data is scarce, expensive, or privacy-sensitive. Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer. However, existing frameworks for multi-agent synthesis often depend on a centralized orchestrator, creating scalability bottlenecks, or are hardcoded for specific domains, limiting flexibility. We present \textbf{Matrix}, a decentralized framework that represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. This peer-to-peer design eliminates the central orchestrator. Each task progresses independently through lightweight agents, while compute-intensive operations, such as LLM inference or containerized environments, are handled by distributed services. Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments. In all cases, Matrix achieves $2$--$15\times$ higher data generation throughput under identical hardware resources, without compromising output quality.

TL;DR: ToolOrchestra方法训练小型编排器来协调智能工具，在Humanity's Last Exam等复杂任务中实现了比GPT-5更高的准确率和更低的成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在处理深度复杂问题时的概念挑战和计算成本高昂的问题，通过小型编排器管理其他模型和工具来提升智能上限和效率。

Method: 使用强化学习训练小型编排器，结合结果、效率和用户偏好的奖励机制，开发了8B参数的Orchestrator模型。

Result: 在HLE任务中得分37.1%，超越GPT-5(35.1%)且效率提升2.5倍；在tau2-Bench和FRAMES任务中大幅超越GPT-5，仅使用约30%的成本。

Conclusion: 通过轻量级编排模型组合多样化工具比现有方法更高效有效，为实用和可扩展的工具增强推理系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models are powerful generalists, yet solving deep and complex problems such as those of the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) remains both conceptually challenging and computationally expensive. We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the upper bound of intelligence and improve efficiency in solving difficult agentic tasks. We introduce ToolOrchestra, a method for training small orchestrators that coordinate intelligent tools. ToolOrchestra explicitly uses reinforcement learning with outcome-, efficiency-, and user-preference-aware rewards. Using ToolOrchestra, we produce Orchestrator, an 8B model that achieves higher accuracy at lower cost than previous tool-use agents while aligning with user preferences on which tools are to be used for a given query. On HLE, Orchestrator achieves a score of 37.1%, outperforming GPT-5 (35.1%) while being 2.5x more efficient. On tau2-Bench and FRAMES, Orchestrator surpasses GPT-5 by a wide margin while using only about 30% of the cost. Extensive analysis shows that Orchestrator achieves the best trade-off between performance and cost under multiple metrics, and generalizes robustly to unseen tools. These results demonstrate that composing diverse tools with a lightweight orchestration model is both more efficient and more effective than existing methods, paving the way for practical and scalable tool-augmented reasoning systems.

TL;DR: 本文通过系统评估LLM在不同难度任务上的泛化能力，发现跨难度泛化有限，训练数据需要包含多种难度级别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对于训练数据难度对LLM性能的影响存在矛盾，需要更客观、大规模的分析来理解LLM在不同难度任务上的泛化能力。

Method: 使用数千个不同LLM的输出和项目反应理论(IRT)对六个数据集中的示例进行难度排序，排除人类主观判断，进行系统评估。

Result: 跨难度泛化通常有限，无论使用简单还是困难数据训练，都无法在整个难度范围内实现一致的改进。

Conclusion: LLM的训练和评估数据需要包含多种难度级别，在难度方面走捷径是有风险的。

Abstract: We investigate how well large language models (LLMs) generalize across different task difficulties, a key question for effective data curation and evaluation. Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data. We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty. We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty. With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties. These results show the importance of having a range of difficulties in both training and evaluation data for LLMs, and that taking shortcuts with respect to difficulty is risky.

### [47] [Are Neuro-Inspired Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models Resilient to Membership Inference Privacy Leakage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20710)
*David Amebley,Sayanton Dibbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于神经科学启发的拓扑正则化框架，用于增强多模态视觉语言模型对成员推理攻击的隐私保护能力，实验表明该方法能显著降低攻击成功率而不显著影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型在代理AI时代面临新的隐私攻击风险，特别是成员推理攻击。现有研究主要关注单模态系统的隐私攻击，而多模态模型的隐私脆弱性及其与神经科学启发的模型之间的关系尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入系统性的神经科学启发拓扑正则化框架(tau)，在三种视觉语言模型(BLIP、PaliGemma 2、ViT-GPT2)上应用，使用三个基准数据集(COCO、CC3M、NoCaps)进行实验，比较基线模型和神经变体模型的隐私攻击弹性。

Result: 在BLIP模型和COCO数据集上的实验显示，神经变体VLM的成员推理攻击成功率平均ROC-AUC下降24%，同时保持相似的模型效用(MPNet和ROUGE-2指标)。在PaliGemma 2和ViT-GPT2模型上的扩展评估进一步验证了结果的稳定性。

Conclusion: 神经启发的多模态视觉语言模型相比基线模型对隐私攻击具有更强的弹性，且不会显著影响模型性能，这为理解多模态模型的隐私风险提供了重要证据。

Abstract: In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.

TL;DR: Inferix是一个专为世界模型设计的下一代推理引擎，通过优化的半自回归解码实现沉浸式世界合成，支持交互式视频流和评测，区别于高并发系统和传统视频扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界模型是智能体AI、具身AI和游戏领域的核心模拟器，能够生成长时、物理真实且交互的高质量视频。扩展这些模型可以解锁视觉感知、理解和推理的新兴能力，超越当前以LLM为中心的视觉基础模型范式。

Method: 采用半自回归（块扩散）解码范式，结合扩散和自回归方法的优势：在块内应用扩散生成视频token，同时以前面块为条件，实现更连贯稳定的视频序列。通过重新引入LLM风格的KV缓存管理，克服标准视频扩散的限制。

Result: Inferix实现了高效、可变长度和高质量的视频生成，支持交互式视频流和性能分析，能够准确建模世界动态。无缝集成LV-Bench评测基准，专门针对分钟级视频生成场景。

Conclusion: Inferix作为专门针对世界模拟的推理引擎，与高并发系统和传统视频扩散模型形成差异化，希望社区共同推进Inferix发展，促进世界模型探索。

Abstract: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.
  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

Motivation: 资源受限设备（如交通摄像头）上的快速准确视频对象识别面临挑战，需要解决何时进行边缘检测与本地跟踪的决策问题。

Method: 提出LTED-Ada算法，基于深度强化学习自适应选择本地跟踪或边缘检测；在多设备场景中使用联邦学习进行协作策略训练。

Result: 通过硬件在环实验验证了LTED-Ada的优越性，能够满足帧率、识别精度和延迟要求。

Conclusion: LTED-Ada为资源受限设备上的视频对象识别提供了一种有效的自适应解决方案，在多设备场景中通过联邦学习进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.

Motivation: 视觉语言动作模型在自动驾驶中统一了感知、推理和轨迹生成，但由于深度transformer堆栈导致推理延迟显著。

Method: 提出基于动作引导的早期退出框架，当预测轨迹与轻量级规划先验（如导航或低精度规划）在可容忍偏差内对齐时终止推理，并引入多跳控制器自适应跳过冗余层。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中实现了28%的transformer层稀疏度和29%的延迟减少，同时保持了规划质量和安全性。

Conclusion: DeeAD可以无缝集成到现有VLA模型中，无需重新训练，有效加速推理过程。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型基础模型虽然功能强大，但尺寸和计算成本过高，难以部署到边缘设备。现有压缩技术会牺牲模型的通用性，需要一种既能压缩模型又能保持其通用表征能力的方法。

Method: 使用Foundry方法训练学生模型学习压缩的SuperTokens，重构教师模型的token级表示，捕捉其潜在空间的紧凑基向量。

Result: 单个蒸馏模型在分类、部分分割和少样本场景等多样化下游任务中保持强迁移能力，接近完整基础模型性能，同时显著减少token数量和FLOPs。

Conclusion: FMD范式成功实现了大型SSL模型的有效压缩，使模型更适合在资源受限的硬件上部署，同时保持了基础模型的通用表征能力。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

TL;DR: DinoLizer是一个基于DINOv2的模型，用于定位生成式修复图像中的篡改区域。通过在DINOv2上添加线性分类头，在14×14补丁分辨率下预测篡改，使用滑动窗口策略处理大图像，在多个修复数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在定位生成式修复图像中的语义篡改区域方面存在不足，需要开发能够准确检测语义内容被修改区域的检测器。

Method: 基于在B-Free数据集上预训练的DINOv2模型，添加线性分类头到Vision Transformer的补丁嵌入上，使用滑动窗口策略处理大尺寸图像，并通过后处理优化二进制篡改掩码。

Result: DinoLizer在多个修复数据集上超越最先进的局部篡改检测器，平均IoU比次优模型高12%，对调整大小、噪声添加和JPEG压缩等后处理操作保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DinoLizer展示了Vision Transformer在篡改定位任务中的强大表示能力，通过DINOv2和DINOv3的消融研究证实了其优越性。

Abstract: We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

TL;DR: CANVAS是一个评估视觉语言模型在基于工具的用户界面设计能力的基准，包含598个设计任务，涵盖设计复制和设计修改两种任务类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法评估基于工具的设计性能，而理解视觉语言模型在传统设计软件中与设计师协作的潜力很重要。

Method: 从3.3K个移动UI设计中采样，创建包含598个工具设计任务的基准，每个任务通过上下文工具调用逐步更新设计。

Result: 领先模型表现出更策略性的工具调用，提高了设计质量，同时识别了常见错误模式。

Conclusion: CANVAS基准揭示了视觉语言模型在工具驱动UI设计中的能力，为未来增强基于工具的设计能力提供了指导。

Abstract: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了文本引导的语义图像编码器(TIE)，通过文本查询条件化生成图像表示，在多个图像到文本基准测试中显著提升性能，同时减少图像token数量提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言模型中的图像编码器通常独立预训练，与语言模型对齐时无法考虑下游任务或文本查询的具体需求，导致处理图像时缺乏针对性。

Method: 开发了文本引导的语义图像编码器(TIE)，能够根据输入文本查询生成条件化的图像表示，使图像编码过程与具体任务需求相关联。

Result: 在1B和3B规模的九个图像到文本基准测试中，TIE分别平均提升1.5和1.3个点，在DocVQA和InfoVQA等任务上提升高达6个点，同时仅使用一半图像tokens即可达到更好性能。

Conclusion: 文本条件化训练能有效优化编码器捕捉关键视觉特征，TIE始终关注查询相关区域，增强了可解释性和查询特定的基础能力。

Abstract: Image encoders, a fundamental component of vision-language models (VLMs), are typically pretrained independently before being aligned with a language model. This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多依赖密集或全场景观测，限制了在受限或部分视角环境中的有效性，需要开发能够从最小视觉输入理解表面材料的方法。

Method: 结合部分卷积U-Net和分类头的架构，在极端观测稀疏度下实现空间修复和语义理解，与卷积自编码器、ViT、MAE、Swin Transformer和DETR等模型进行比较。

Result: 在真实世界表面纹理数据集上取得最先进结果，PSNR为17.55 dB，材料分类准确率达到85.10%。

Conclusion: 部分卷积在缺失数据下的空间推理具有优势，为最小视觉表面理解建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Understanding material surfaces from sparse visual cues is critical for applications in robotics, simulation, and material perception. However, most existing methods rely on dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained or partial view environment. To address this challenge, we introduce SMARC, a unified model for Surface MAterial Reconstruction and Classification from minimal visual input. By giving only a single 10% contiguous patch of the image, SMARC recognizes and reconstructs the full RGB surface while simultaneously classifying the material category. Our architecture combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity. We compared SMARC against five models including convolutional autoencoders [17], Vision Transformer (ViT) [13], Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [5], Swin Transformer [9], and DETR [2] using Touch and Go dataset [16] of real-world surface textures. SMARC achieves state-of-the-art results with a PSNR of 17.55 dB and a material classification accuracy of 85.10%. Our findings highlight the advantages of partial convolution in spatial reasoning under missing data and establish a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding.

TL;DR: LongVT是一个端到端的代理框架，通过交错的多模态工具链思维实现长视频推理，利用LMMs的时序定位能力作为原生视频裁剪工具，从全局到局部进行推理循环，直到答案基于检索到的视觉证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在长视频推理中容易产生幻觉，特别是在证据稀疏且时间分散的情况下。受人类理解长视频的方式启发（先全局浏览再检查相关片段），需要开发能够处理长视频推理的框架。

Method: 提出LongVT框架，利用LMMs的时序定位能力作为视频裁剪工具，通过全局到局部的推理循环，逐步细化视频帧采样。采用三阶段训练策略：工具集成的冷启动监督微调、代理强化学习和代理强化微调。

Result: LongVT在四个具有挑战性的长视频理解和推理基准测试中持续优于现有强基线模型。发布了包含247.9K训练样本和1,280个QA对的VideoSIAH数据集。

Conclusion: LongVT通过代理式多模态工具链思维有效解决了长视频推理中的幻觉问题，展示了在长视频理解和推理任务上的优越性能。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 对KRISP模型进行轻量级复现，参数大幅减少但性能保持75%，揭示了原模型的设计缺陷和实际问题，在资源受限条件下验证知识增强VQA架构的可扩展性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原KRISP模型虽然有效但计算需求大、与大型骨干网络紧密耦合，不适合工业规模训练。本研究旨在重新审视该模型，提供参数更少的轻量级版本。

Method: 通过系统消融研究进行轻量级复现，包括在合成VQA数据上的概念验证和在DAQUAR数据集上的评估，使用低参数配置和受限的外部知识图谱域。

Result: 复现模型性能达到原模型的75%，同时揭示了原论文未充分覆盖的设计缺陷和实际问题，证明了在资源受限条件下的可行性。

Conclusion: 轻量级KRISP模型参数少，可在智能手机和AR-VR等边缘设备上运行，改善离线视觉推理，防止AI幻觉，仅在特定知识域内生成输出。

Abstract: Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.

*Dario Morle,Reid Zaffino*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为"warping"的统一算子来泛化现有的动态采样方法，分析了其在深度学习中的理论特性，包括前向-反向传播不对称性、与传统卷积算子的正交性，以及稳定训练条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态采样机制在计算机视觉模型中已显示出实用性，但缺乏统一的理论分析框架。本文旨在连接各种动态采样方法，建立统一的理论基础。

Method: 开发并分析了一个名为"warping"的新型算子，该算子能够重构现有架构（如可变形卷积、主动卷积单元和空间变换网络），并对输入作为独立同分布变量和齐次随机场进行统计分析。

Result: 发现了模型训练中前向和反向传播之间的独特不对称性，证明这些机制代表了与传统平移不变卷积算子完全不同的正交算子类别，并确定了确保动态采样网络稳定训练的条件。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实证研究，建立了动态采样机制的统一理论框架，揭示了其独特性质，并提出了确保训练稳定性的条件，为理解这类网络的学习行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures have demonstrated utility across many computer vision models, though the theoretical analysis of these structures has not yet been unified. In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term "warping". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied. Finally, we introduce a novel loss landscape visualization which utilizes gradient update information directly, to better understand learning behavior.

TL;DR: Δ-NeRF是一个模块化残差框架，用于神经辐射场(NeRF)的增量优化，通过残差控制器、不确定性感知门控和视图选择策略，实现在不访问历史数据的情况下持续改进3D重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF框架在引入新视图时需要完全重新训练，限制了在数据顺序到达场景（如卫星地形分析）中的应用。增量优化方法存在灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出Δ-NeRF框架，包含：1)残差控制器向冻结的基础NeRF注入逐层修正；2)不确定性感知门控机制自适应结合基础和优化预测；3)视图选择策略减少47%训练数据；4)知识蒸馏将增强模型压缩至原大小20%。

Result: 在卫星图像上，Δ-NeRF性能与联合训练相当，训练时间减少30-42%。相比简单微调，PSNR提升达43.5%，在某些指标上甚至超过联合训练。

Conclusion: Δ-NeRF为NeRF的增量优化提供了有效解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本，特别适用于卫星地形分析等顺序数据场景。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.

TL;DR: 提出Split-then-Merge (StM)框架，通过将未标注视频分割为动态前景和背景层，然后自组合学习动态主体与多样化场景的交互，解决生成视频合成的控制问题和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖标注数据集或手工规则，存在数据稀缺问题。StM旨在增强生成视频合成的控制能力，通过自监督方式学习复杂组合动态。

Method: 将未标注视频分割为动态前景和背景层，然后自组合学习交互；引入变换感知训练管道，使用多层融合和增强实现affordance感知组合；采用身份保持损失保持前景保真度。

Result: 实验显示StM在定量基准测试和人类/VLLM定性评估中均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: StM框架通过自监督分割和组合学习，有效解决了生成视频合成的控制问题和数据稀缺挑战，实现了更真实的视频生成。

Abstract: We present Split-then-Merge (StM), a novel framework designed to enhance control in generative video composition and address its data scarcity problem. Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: We present Sphinx, a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that targets core cognitive primitives. Sphinx procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives, each paired with verifiable ground-truth solutions, enabling both precise evaluation and large-scale dataset construction. The benchmark covers 25 task types spanning symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction. Evaluating recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) shows that even state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 51.1% accuracy, well below human performance. Finally, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) substantially improves model accuracy on these tasks and yields gains on external visual reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its promise for advancing multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 优化视觉反转方法作为先验替代方案具有潜力，当前评估基准存在缺陷，该方法值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床诊断、治疗规划和手术导航中，准确检测血管树中心线并保持高召回率至关重要，因为遗漏小分支可能导致致命错误。

Method: 采用Producer-Refiner架构，基于Transformer解码器，Producer提出初始汇合轨迹，Refiner循环精炼这些轨迹形成最终中心线图，并使用空间树图的高效非极大值抑制算法合并重复分支。

Result: 在多个公共中心线数据集上，RefTr实现了比先前SOTA更高的召回率和相当的精度，同时推理速度更快、参数更少（解码器参数减少2.4倍）。

Conclusion: RefTr展示了作为3D医学影像中血管树分析的新SOTA框架的潜力，在保持高召回率的同时提高了效率和精度。

Abstract: Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

Abstract: We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog. We make our code and SDIRF publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters} to the community with the aim of advancing the research on visual perception in fog.

Motivation: 跨视角对象对应任务（如自我-外部视角对应）面临视角和外观剧烈变化的挑战，现有分割模型如SAM2无法直接应用。

Method: 提出两个提示生成器：V^2-Anchor基于DINOv3特征建立几何感知对应，V^2-Visual通过视觉提示匹配器增强外观引导线索；采用多专家设计和后验循环一致性选择器自适应选择最可靠的专家。

Result: 在Ego-Exo4D、DAVIS-2017和HANDAL-X三个基准测试中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: V^2-SAM有效解决了跨视角对象对应问题，通过几何和外观线索的互补结合实现了鲁棒的对应性能。

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

Method: 通过优化分类器自由引导中的无条件嵌入而非操作潜在变量或噪声变量，在语义空间进行对齐，防止利用非语义噪声模式来提高奖励。

Result: Null-TTA在目标测试时对齐方面达到最先进水平，同时保持强大的跨奖励泛化能力。

Conclusion: 语义空间优化是测试时对齐的有效且有原则的新范式。

Abstract: Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

TL;DR: GaINeR是一个结合可训练高斯分布和神经网络的几何感知隐式网络表示框架，用于2D图像的连续表示、可解释几何结构和灵活局部编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统隐式神经表示缺乏显式几何结构，局部编辑能力有限，难以与物理仿真集成，限制了在动态或交互式场景中的应用。

Method: 提出GaINeR框架，通过检索图像坐标的K最近高斯分布，聚合距离加权的嵌入，并通过神经网络预测RGB值。

Result: 该方法实现了连续图像表示、可解释几何结构，并支持灵活的局部编辑，为物理感知和交互式图像操作奠定了基础。

Conclusion: GaINeR成功解决了传统INR在几何结构和编辑能力方面的限制，提供了一个更适用于动态和交互场景的图像表示框架。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have become an essential tool for modeling continuous 2D images, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction, super-resolution, and compression. Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details. However, traditional INRs often lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their applicability in dynamic or interactive settings. To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network. This design enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation. The official implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WJakubowska/GaINeR.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种深度学习模型，用于降低小脑桥脑角池对比增强T1加权MRI的造影剂剂量，通过从10%-30%标准剂量的低剂量图像恢复出标准剂量质量的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少MRI检查中造影剂的使用剂量，降低患者风险和检查成本，同时保持诊断图像质量。

Method: 使用多中心回顾性研究数据，训练深度学习模型从模拟低剂量T1ce图像恢复标准剂量图像，评估不同剂量水平下的图像质量和分割性能。

Result: 在10%输入剂量下，DL恢复的T1ce图像显著改善了分割性能（Dice从0.673提升到0.734），图像质量指标（SSIM和PSNR）随剂量增加而提高，10%-30%剂量恢复的图像质量优秀。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型能够显著改善低剂量MRI的图像质量，使得仅使用10%-30%标准剂量的情况下仍能进行病变检测和诊断特征分析。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种平滑正则化技术，通过在视频识别模型中引入高斯随机游走约束，强制中间层嵌入在连续帧之间平滑变化，从而提升轻量级模型的时序建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轻量级视频识别模型在捕捉复杂时序动态方面存在困难，而视频本身具有天然的时序连贯性。通过引入强时序归纳偏置，可以让轻量模型更有效地利用这种连贯性。

Method: 使用高斯随机游走(GRW)对连续帧中间层嵌入的变化进行建模，惩罚表示上的突变，促进低加速度的平滑解，与视频的自然时序一致性对齐。

Result: 在Kinetics-600数据集上提升准确率3.8%-6.4%；MoViNets模型家族在各自FLOP约束下将当前最佳结果提升3.8%-6.1%；MobileNetV3和MoViNets-Stream在可比内存占用下实现4.9%-6.4%的增益。

Conclusion: 平滑正则化技术能有效提升轻量级视频识别模型的性能，通过强制时序平滑性让模型更好地捕捉视频动态，在多个模型架构上都取得了显著的精度提升。

Abstract: We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

Abstract: Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.

Conclusion: UruDendro4数据集填补了木材横截面数据空白，支持年生长体积建模，为自动年轮检测提供了可靠的基准和训练数据。

Abstract: Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.
  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.
  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.

Conclusion: 描述符感知的视觉模型结合标记级和对齐损失训练，无需配对图像-报告数据即可提升自动报告指标和临床效果。

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像合成研究主要关注视觉真实性和语义合理性，但在现代内容创作中，许多合成并不旨在保持真实感，而是追求艺术性、趣味性或社交参与度。

Method: 提出了StickerNet两阶段框架：首先确定合成类型，然后预测不透明度、遮罩、位置和缩放等放置参数。基于从匿名在线视觉创作平台收集的180万次编辑行为构建数据集。

Result: 用户研究和定量评估表明，StickerNet优于常见基线方法，并接近人类放置行为，证明了从真实世界编辑模式学习的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作引入了视觉理解的新方向，强调表达性和用户意图而非真实性。

Abstract: As a widely used operation in image editing workflows, image composition has traditionally been studied with a focus on achieving visual realism and semantic plausibility. However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.

Motivation: 多摄像头交通视频数据量大，传统使用VLM将视频转文本再通过LLM分析的方法耗时严重，无法及时生成交通洞察和调查事故。

Method: 采用顺序处理摄像头重叠区域，迭代应用不同token限制的VLM，利用前序输出作为后续摄像头提示，并通过对象级相似性检测器智能跳过冗余VLM调用。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，TrafficLens将视频到文本转换时间减少高达4倍，同时保持信息准确性。

Conclusion: TrafficLens有效解决了多摄像头交通视频分析中的处理延迟问题，实现了快速准确的视频内容描述生成。

Abstract: Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.

Motivation: 医疗机构的协作机器学习需要保护患者隐私，传统联邦学习的梯度仍易受重建攻击，需要更安全的隐私保护方案。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers的CLS令牌作为768维特征表示，采用CKKS同态加密在传输前加密这些令牌，实现安全聚合。

Result: 梯度易受模型反演攻击（PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999），而CLS保护的HE方法能防止此类攻击，加密数据传输仅326KB/轮，分类准确率在未加密域达96.12%，加密域达90.02%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在保护隐私的同时实现了高效的联邦学习，显著降低了通信开销并防止了敏感医疗信息的泄露。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.

Conclusion: 提出的无反转框架通过联合建模内容、风格和风格化分布，实现了鲁棒的融合，避免了简单叠加的缺点，提升了视觉保真度、内容保持和计算效率。

Abstract: Style transfer, a pivotal task in image processing, synthesizes visually compelling images by seamlessly blending realistic content with artistic styles, enabling applications in photo editing and creative design. While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.

Motivation: 当前Referring Camouflaged Object Detection (Ref-COD)系统采用双分支设计，需要在测试时提供参考图像，这限制了部署性、增加了延迟和数据收集负担。

Method: 在训练期间将参考图像蒸馏到类别原型内存中，使用EMA更新的每类别原型，通过查询预测混合权重来生成指导向量，无需测试时参考图像。提出双向注意力对齐模块来弥合参考统计和伪装查询特征之间的表示差距。

Result: 在R2C7K基准测试上的大量实验表明，该方法与现有最先进方法相比具有竞争性或更优的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为Ref-COD提供了一种简单高效的路径，无需强制性的参考图像，提高了部署性和效率。

Abstract: Referring Camouflaged Object Detection (Ref-COD) segments specified camouflaged objects in a scene by leveraging a small set of referring images. Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance of the proposed method compared with recent state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/RefOnce.

Conclusion: WavePCNet通过物理驱动的波前传播补偿，有效提升了在复杂环境条件下对遮挡物体的感知和分割性能

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view is highly challenging due to multiple scattering and medium-induced perturbations. Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的图像分层分解方法，通过轻量级微调将修复模型适配用于分层分解，并引入多模态上下文融合模块来保留细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像可以看作前景对象在背景上的分层组合，这种分层表示能实现元素的独立编辑，为内容创作提供更大灵活性。但由于方法和数据有限，单图像分层分解仍具挑战性。

Method: 观察到分层分解与图像修复任务之间的强关联，通过轻量级微调将基于扩散的修复模型适配用于分层分解，并引入具有线性注意力复杂度的多模态上下文融合模块来保留潜在空间细节。

Result: 模型在纯合成数据集上训练，在对象移除和遮挡恢复方面表现出色，为下游编辑和创意应用开辟了新可能性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了单图像的分层分解，在对象移除和遮挡恢复任务中表现优异，为图像编辑和创意应用提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: Images can be viewed as layered compositions, foreground objects over background, with potential occlusions. This layered representation enables independent editing of elements, offering greater flexibility for content creation. Despite the progress in large generative models, decomposing a single image into layers remains challenging due to limited methods and data. We observe a strong connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks, and propose adapting a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. To further preserve detail in the latent space, we introduce a novel multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity. Our model is trained purely on a synthetic dataset constructed from open-source assets and achieves superior performance in object removal and occlusion recovery, unlocking new possibilities in downstream editing and creative applications.

TL;DR: MERGE是首个用于新闻图像字幕的多模态实体感知检索增强生成框架，通过构建实体中心的多模态知识库，解决了现有方法在信息覆盖、跨模态对齐和视觉实体定位方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有新闻图像字幕方法存在三个关键问题：信息覆盖不完整、跨模态对齐弱、视觉实体定位不优。

Method: 构建实体中心的多模态知识库(EMKB)，整合文本、视觉和结构化知识；采用多阶段假设-字幕策略改善跨模态对齐；通过图像内容引导的动态检索增强视觉实体匹配。

Result: 在GoodNews和NYTimes800k数据集上显著优于最先进基线，CIDEr分别提升+6.84和+1.16，命名实体识别F1分数分别提升+4.14和+2.64。在未见过的Visual News数据集上表现优异，CIDEr提升+20.17，F1分数提升+6.22。

Conclusion: MERGE框架在新闻图像字幕任务中表现出色，具有强大的鲁棒性和领域适应性。

Abstract: News image captioning aims to produce journalistically informative descriptions by combining visual content with contextual cues from associated articles. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. Notably, MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset, achieving +20.17 in CIDEr and +6.22 in F1-score, demonstrating strong robustness and domain adaptability.

TL;DR: MetaRank是一个基于元学习的框架，用于自动选择最适合特定任务的模型可迁移性评估指标，解决了传统方法依赖平均历史性能的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型可迁移性评估指标选择通常是临时性的或仅基于指标的平均历史表现，但实际中不同指标在不同任务上的效果差异很大，缺乏通用的最优指标。

Method: 将指标选择建模为学习排序问题，使用预训练语言模型编码数据集和指标的文本描述，在共享语义空间中嵌入，通过元预测器离线学习数据集特征与指标机制之间的关系，采用列表式优化目标优先正确排序表现最佳的指标。

Result: 在11个预训练模型和11个目标数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法具有强大的有效性。

Conclusion: MetaRank能够基于新目标数据集的文本描述有效排序候选MTE指标，使实践者能够先验地选择最合适的指标。

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate pre-trained source model is a critical, yet computationally expensive, task in transfer learning. Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori. Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate the strong effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 现有可信多视图分类方法依赖全局密集邻居关系建模视图内依赖，计算成本高且无法直接保证视图间关系一致性，同时通过手动分配权重聚合证据，缺乏对学习到的多视图邻居结构在类别空间一致性的保证。

Method: 引入原型来表示每个视图的邻居结构，简化视图内邻居关系学习，实现视图内和视图间结构的动态对齐，促进跨视图共识的高效一致发现。

Result: 在多个公开多视图数据集上的实验表明，该方法在性能和鲁棒性方面与主流可信多视图分类方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于原型的可信多视图分类框架能够更高效和一致地发现跨视图共识，在保持竞争性能的同时提高了方法的可信度。

Abstract: Trustworthy multi-view classification (TMVC) addresses the challenge of achieving reliable decision-making in complex scenarios where multi-source information is heterogeneous, inconsistent, or even conflicting. Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

TL;DR: CameraMaster是一个统一的相机感知框架，通过显式解耦相机指令并整合指令表示和参数嵌入，实现精确的图像修饰控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖模糊的文本提示难以精确控制相机参数，要么需要训练分离的权重头，限制了可扩展性和多参数组合能力。

Method: 使用相机参数嵌入调制相机指令和内容语义，通过交叉注意力将调制后的指令注入内容特征，同时在去噪过程中统一注入指令和相机嵌入作为条件信号。

Result: 实验表明CameraMaster对参数变化产生单调且近似线性的响应，支持无缝多参数组合，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CameraMaster通过语义-参数对齐的统一调制框架，有效解决了图像修饰中精确相机参数控制的挑战。

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have greatly advanced image editing and generation. However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.

Motivation: 当前评估方法未能回答一个基本问题：图像描述能否在实际下游任务中替代图像？需要基于效用的评估基准来衡量描述质量。

Method: 构建多领域基准，包含4个领域（自然、文档、电商、具身AI）和细粒度分类，创建33,027个需要视觉信息回答的多选题，使用LLM仅基于描述回答问题来评估效用。

Result: 评估显示图像与其描述效用之间存在显著差距，在传统图像QA基准上表现相近的模型，在描述效用上下降高达32%。

Conclusion: CaptionQA基准能有效评估图像描述的下游任务效用，揭示了当前MLLM在生成实用描述方面的不足，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Image captions serve as efficient surrogates for visual content in multimodal systems such as retrieval, recommendation, and multi-step agentic inference pipelines. Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains. The code is available at https://github.com/bronyayang/CaptionQA.

Result: 在AIST++和FineDance数据集上的实验表明，FlowerDance在动作质量和生成效率方面均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: FlowerDance不仅能够生成精致的舞蹈动作，还在推理速度和内存利用方面实现了显著的生成效率提升，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to translate auditory signals into expressive human motion, with broad applications in virtual reality, choreography, and digital entertainment. Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner. Meanwhile, FlowerDance supports motion editing, enabling users to interactively refine dance sequences. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and FineDance show that FlowerDance achieves state-of-the-art results in both motion quality and generation efficiency. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Diagnosing lung cancer typically involves physicians identifying lung nodules in Computed tomography (CT) scans and generating diagnostic reports based on their morphological features and medical expertise. Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules. LungNoduleAgent stands out as a promising foundational tool for supporting clinical analyses of lung nodules.

Conclusion: 该框架通过将生成先验与密集物理约束相结合，有效弥合了物理精度和感知真实感之间的差距，为空间变化图像去模糊问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatially varying image deblurring remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem, especially when degradations arise from complex mixtures of motion and other forms of blur under significant noise. State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based methods as well as generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios.

Conclusion: MUSE为情感合成建立了新范式，证明了统一框架在图像情感生成和编辑任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Images evoke emotions that profoundly influence perception, often prioritized over content. Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression. It establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis.

Conclusion: T-NIG模型能够有效处理不规则时间分布的数据，在阿尔茨海默病预测中保持疾病特征，为医学诊断提供可靠的图像生成基础。

Abstract: Image generation can provide physicians with an imaging diagnosis basis in the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset. Experimental results indicate that T-NIG is proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics, even when faced with an irregular temporal data distribution.

Conclusion: MIRA通过模拟多轮人机交互过程，有效解决了复杂指令下的图像编辑问题，为指令引导的图像编辑提供了更准确和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing offers an intuitive way for users to edit images with natural language. However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions. When paired with open-source image editing models such as Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, and Qwen-Image-Edit, MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems such as GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

Abstract: Iris authentication algorithms have achieved impressive recognition performance, making them highly promising for real-world applications such as border control, citizen identification, and both criminal investigations and commercial systems. However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye

Abstract: Understanding reflection remains a long-standing challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections. In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically "sculpts" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.

TL;DR: RadarFM：一个雷达基础模型，通过结构化空间语言监督学习统一的场景级表示，解决现有雷达方法碎片化和任务特定化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雷达传感器在各种恶劣天气、光照和远距离条件下提供可靠的感知能力，但现有雷达方法碎片化且任务特定化，每个下游任务使用不同的架构和训练目标，阻碍了跨任务迁移。

Method: 提出RadarFM雷达基础模型，包含：(1)结构化标注框架，在原生雷达坐标中编码车辆分布；(2)哈希感知对比学习目标，量化连续场景相似性而非二元匹配，实现细粒度空间推理。利用CARLA模拟器生成大规模、良好标注的雷达数据集。

Result: 提出了定位感知指标，评估超越传统检测指标的空间精度。

Conclusion: RadarFM通过结构化空间语言监督学习统一场景表示，解决了雷达感知中的碎片化问题，为跨任务迁移提供了基础。

Abstract: Radar sensors provide reliable perception across adverse weather, lighting, and long-range conditions. Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning. Leveraging the CARLA simulator, we generate large-scale, well-annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios. We also propose localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures.

Conclusion: EM-KD通过解决视觉令牌不平衡问题，有效提升了高效多模态大语言模型的性能，验证了该方法的有效性

Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption, but the loss of visual information can degrade comprehension capabilities. Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.

TL;DR: FaithFusion是一个基于像素级期望信息增益(EIG)的3D高斯扩散融合框架，用于可控驾驶场景重建和3D场景生成，解决几何保真度和视觉逼真度之间的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可控驾驶场景重建和3D场景生成中，需要在保持几何保真度的同时，在大视角变化下合成视觉上合理的场景外观。然而，基于几何的3DGS和基于外观的扩散模型的有效融合面临挑战，缺乏像素级、3D一致的编辑标准会导致过度修复和几何漂移。

Conclusion: FaithFusion通过EIG驱动的3DGS-扩散融合框架，成功解决了可控驾驶场景重建中的几何保真度和视觉逼真度平衡问题，实现了高质量的3D场景生成。

Abstract: In controllable driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation, maintaining geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts is crucial. However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DATGN的新方法，通过自动学习脑部图像中与疾病进展相关的形态变化来进行阿尔茨海默病的早期预测。该方法能够处理时间序列MRI图像中的缺失数据，并生成符合疾病进展趋势的未来MRI图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病是一种退行性脑部疾病，早期预测有助于延缓疾病进展。当前预测方法主要依赖手动特征提取来分析脑部图像的形态变化，需要自动化方法来提高效率和准确性。

Method: DATGN方法首先对不完整的时间序列MRI图像进行插值，然后使用双向时间变形感知模块指导网络生成符合疾病进展的未来MRI图像，从而实现阿尔茨海默病的早期预测。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上的实验结果显示，DATGN在PSNR和MMSE图像质量指标上表现优异。将DATGN生成的合成数据集成到SVM、CNN和3DCNN分类方法中，AD vs NC分类准确率提高了6.21%到16%，AD vs MCI vs NC分类准确率提高了7.34%到21.25%。

Conclusion: DATGN能够生成与阿尔茨海默病脑萎缩趋势一致的MRI图像，实现了有效的早期疾病预测，为阿尔茨海默病的诊断和治疗提供了有前景的技术支持。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.

Abstract: Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的几何线索（如深度、边缘）不足以约束外观、材质和光照，限制了物理上有意义的编辑（如重新照明或材质交换）并导致时间漂移。需要额外的图形模态来提供互补约束。

Result: 在理解和生成基准测试中，CtrlVDiff实现了卓越的可控性和保真度，支持分层编辑（重新照明、材质调整、对象插入），并在某些模态不可用时保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过融合多种图形模态，CtrlVDiff在统一的扩散框架中成功解决了视频理解和可控生成的双重挑战，实现了精确、可预测的控制和强时间一致性。

Abstract: We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.
  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.
  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.

Conclusion: FKE方法成功实现了核级别的模糊过程学习，显著提升了图像去模糊性能，且具有处理其他核相关问题的潜力。

Abstract: It is well-known that if a network aims to learn how to deblur, it should understand the blur process. Blurring is naturally caused by the convolution of the sharp image with the blur kernel. Thus, allowing the network to learn the blur process in the kernel-level can significantly improve the image deblurring performance. But, current deep networks are still at the pixel-level learning stage, either performing end-to-end pixel-level restoration or stage-wise pseudo kernel-level restoration, failing to enable the deblur model to understand the essence of the blur. To this end, we propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE), which considers the activation operation in Fourier space and converts the convolution problem in the spatial domain to a multiplication problem in Fourier space. Our FKE, jointly optimized with the deblur model, enables the network to learn the kernel-level blur process with low complexity and without any additional supervision. Furthermore, we change the convolution object of the kernel from ``image" to network extracted ``feature", whose rich semantic and structural information is more suitable to blur process learning. With the convolution of the feature and the estimated kernel, our model can learn the essence of blur in kernel-level. To further improve the efficiency of feature extraction, we design a decoupled multi-scale architecture with multiple hierarchical sub-unets with a reversible strategy, which allows better multi-scale encoding and decoding in low training memory. Extensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and show potential for handling other kernel-related problems. Analysis also shows our kernel estimator is able to learn physically meaningful kernels. The code will be available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/Single-Image-Deblur.

Abstract: Human video generation has advanced rapidly with the development of diffusion models, but the high computational cost and substantial memory consumption associated with training these models on high-resolution, multi-frame data pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog), an efficient training framework tailored for diffusion models on human video generation. First, we introduce Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess the importance of different model components on the target conditional generation task, enabling prioritized training of the most critical components. Second, we introduce an adaptive progressive schedule that adaptively increases computational complexity during training by measuring the convergence efficiency. Ent-Prog reduces both training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining model performance. Extensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Ent-Prog, achieving up to 2.2$\times$ training speedup and 2.4$\times$ GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.

TL;DR: AnchorOPT是一个动态锚点提示学习框架，通过动态学习锚点值和位置关系来提升CLIP模型的泛化能力，无需额外模块即可达到或超越现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法使用静态的文本锚点（如"形状"、"颜色"等）来指导可学习软标记，但这些锚点在值和位置上都缺乏跨任务和阶段自适应的灵活性。

Method: 提出AnchorOPT框架，在两个方面引入动态性：(1)锚点值从任务特定数据中动态学习，而非手工设计的显式文本标记；(2)锚点与软标记的位置关系通过可学习位置矩阵根据训练阶段和任务上下文自适应优化。采用两阶段训练：先学习锚点标记，然后冻结并转移到第二阶段优化软标记和位置矩阵。

Result: 广泛实验表明，仅使用简单的可学习锚点和位置矩阵，就能达到或超过一些包含额外可学习模块或正则化技术的方法的性能。作为即插即用模块，AnchorOPT能无缝集成到现有框架中，在多样化数据集上带来一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: AnchorOPT通过动态锚点机制有效解决了现有提示学习方法中锚点静态性的限制，提供了一种灵活高效的提示学习解决方案。

Abstract: Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., "shape", "color"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhengli97/ATPrompt.

Motivation: 现有方法存在两个问题：条件查询缺乏帧间依赖性和变化建模，难以处理帧间显著变化；文本约束集成过晚，可能导致视频特征关注非目标对象。

Method: 引入代理查询集来集成视觉和文本语义，在多阶段视频特征编码中逐步更新和传播代理查询，将跨模态交互解耦为时间和空间维度，并设计联合语义一致性训练策略。

Result: 在四个广泛使用的RVOS基准测试上进行的综合实验表明，ProxyFormer优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: ProxyFormer通过代理查询机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了跨模态对齐和目标跟踪的准确性和连贯性。

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is an emerging cross-modality task that aims to generate pixel-level maps of the target objects referred by given textual expressions. The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有的安全评估方法主要关注静态图像和文本生成，无法捕捉视频生成中的复杂时序动态，因此需要专门针对T2V模型的安全评估框架。

Method: 采用时间感知的测试生成器，通过两阶段优化（初始生成器训练和时间感知在线偏好学习）来创建看似无害但能利用时序动态引发违规视频的文本提示，并使用精炼模型循环改进提示的隐蔽性和对抗效果。

Result: 在开源和商业T2V系统上的广泛实验评估显示，TEAR实现了超过80%的攻击成功率，相比之前最佳结果57%有显著提升。

Conclusion: TEAR框架有效揭示了T2V模型在时序动态方面的安全风险，为视频生成模型的安全评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) models are capable of synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent dynamic video content, but the diverse generation also inherently introduces critical safety challenges. Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.

TL;DR: LLaVA-UHD v3提出了一种渐进式视觉压缩方法，能够在保持性能的同时显著降低多模态大语言模型的计算开销和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型倾向于使用全局原生分辨率视觉编码，虽然提升了整体能力，但带来了巨大的计算开销。需要找到一种既能保持性能又能提高效率的解决方案。

Method: 提出渐进式视觉压缩方法，包含两个关键模块：精炼补丁嵌入（支持灵活补丁大小缩放）和窗口化令牌压缩（在ViT层间分层部署以逐步聚合局部令牌表示）。

Result: 转换后的ViT-UHD在保持与MoonViT竞争性能的同时，将TTFT降低了2.4倍；基于此的LLaVA-UHD v3在保持与Qwen2-VL竞争性能的同时，进一步将TTFT降低了1.9倍。

Conclusion: 渐进式视觉压缩方法能够有效平衡多模态大语言模型的性能和效率，为高效MLLM研究提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x. We will release all code and checkpoints to support future research on efficient MLLMs.

Method: 研究方法包括：1）引入Idis数据集，这是一个视觉问答数据集，系统地在语义、数值和空间维度上变化干扰信息；2）分析视觉干扰与文本干扰的根本差异；3）通过跟踪推理轨迹中的属性计数来理解干扰、推理长度和准确性之间的相互作用；4）在已建立的视觉偏见基准（如Waterbirds）上验证趋势；5）提出简单的提示策略来缓解推理模型中的偏见驱动预测。

Result: 研究结果显示：1）视觉干扰与文本干扰存在根本差异：虽然逆扩展现象仍然存在，但添加视觉干扰会降低准确性而不增加推理长度；2）跟踪推理轨迹中的属性计数为理解干扰、推理长度和准确性之间的相互作用提供了关键见解；3）这些趋势在已建立的视觉偏见基准（如Waterbirds）中同样适用。

Conclusion: 研究结论是：视觉干扰对视觉语言模型的影响与文本干扰不同，会降低准确性但不增加推理长度。通过跟踪属性计数可以深入理解干扰的影响机制，并且简单的提示策略可以有效缓解偏见驱动的预测，为改进多模态模型的鲁棒性提供了实用方法。

Abstract: How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

TL;DR: GridAR是一个视觉自回归模型的测试时扩展框架，通过网格分区渐进生成和布局指定提示重构策略，在有限计算资源下实现更高质量的文本到图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉自回归模型在测试时扩展方面存在挑战，直接应用Best-of-N等策略效果不佳，因为会消耗完整计算在错误生成轨迹上，且光栅扫描解码缺乏整体画布蓝图。

Method: GridAR采用网格分区渐进生成方案，在同一位置生成多个部分候选，早期修剪不可行候选，将可行候选固定为锚点指导后续解码；同时使用布局指定提示重构策略，通过检查部分视图推断可行布局。

Result: 在N=4时，GridAR比Best-of-N（N=8）在T2I-CompBench++上性能提升14.4%，成本降低25.6%；在图像编辑任务中，相比更大N的基线方法，语义保持度提升13.9%。

Conclusion: GridAR框架有效解决了视觉自回归模型的测试时扩展挑战，在有限计算资源下实现了更高质量的生成结果，并能推广到图像编辑任务。

Abstract: Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

TL;DR: NDTokenizer3D是一个通用的3D视觉语言模型，通过多尺度NDT表示和三阶段场景标记化流程，统一处理多种3D场景理解任务，并在3D参考分割、视觉问答和密集描述任务中取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D视觉语言模型在有效标记3D场景为整体场景标记，并跨多种3D理解任务利用这些标记方面面临挑战。

Method: 提出基于多尺度NDT表示的三阶段场景标记化流程，包括构建多尺度NDT表示、使用多尺度NDT解码器融合跨尺度特征生成场景标记，并将解码器重新用作人机交互提示和分割掩码解码的通用接口。

Result: 在3D参考分割、3D视觉问答和3D密集描述任务中实现了显著改进。

Conclusion: NDTokenizer3D提供了一个细粒度、通用的3D视觉语言模型，通过紧凑统一的设计将语言级推理与3D空间理解相结合。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D vision-language models (VLMs) highlight a strong potential for 3D scene understanding and reasoning. However, effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens, and leveraging these tokens across diverse 3D understanding tasks, remain highly challenging. We present NDTokenizer3D, a generalist 3D VLM that performs a wide range of 3D scene understanding tasks while naturally supporting human interactions, thereby bridging language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding. The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.

TL;DR: 提出了UPA-RFAS框架，通过鲁棒特征、注意力和语义攻击来生成对抗VLA模型的通用可迁移对抗补丁，解决了现有补丁在未知架构、微调变体和仿真到现实迁移中的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗补丁方法通常过拟合到单一模型，在黑盒设置下失效，缺乏对VLA模型的通用可迁移攻击研究。

Method: 结合特征空间目标（ℓ1偏差先验和排斥性InfoNCE损失）、鲁棒增强的两阶段min-max优化（内循环学习不可见样本扰动，外循环优化通用补丁），以及VLA特定损失（补丁注意力主导和补丁语义错配）。

Result: 实验表明UPA-RFAS在不同VLA模型、操作套件和物理执行中都能一致地跨模型、任务和视角迁移，暴露了实用的基于补丁的攻击面。

Conclusion: UPA-RFAS为VLA模型建立了强大的对抗攻击基准，为未来防御研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在空间智能方面表现不足，缺乏从2D图像重建3D空间的能力，这限制了它们在空间理解和推理任务上的表现。

Method: 提出G²VLM模型，利用学习到的3D视觉几何特征直接预测3D属性，并通过上下文学习和交错推理增强空间推理任务。该统一设计可扩展训练多视角图像和视频数据。

Result: G²VLM在3D重建任务上达到与最先进前馈模型相当的结果，在空间理解和推理任务上取得更好或具有竞争力的表现。

Conclusion: 通过将语义强大的VLM与低级3D视觉任务统一，G²VLM为社区提供了强大的基准，有望解锁更多未来应用如3D场景编辑。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still lack robustness in spatial intelligence, demonstrating poor performance on spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.

Motivation: 现有深度聚类方法存在全局特征和局部特征结构不一致的问题：局部特征在同类样本中具有强一致性和紧凑性，而全局特征则存在边界交织和聚类分离度差的问题。

Method: 首先通过自适应k近邻一致性过滤识别高置信度样本作为可靠锚点，然后利用这些样本计算判别性损失，促进类内紧凑性和类间分离性来指导网络优化。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，DCBoost显著提升了各种现有深度聚类模型的性能，将当前最先进基线方法（如ProPos）的性能提升了3%以上，并将轮廓系数放大了7倍以上。

Conclusion: DCBoost是一个有效的参数自由插件，能够通过利用局部结构信息来增强全局特征结构，显著提升深度聚类模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent deep clustering models have produced impressive clustering performance. However, a common issue with existing methods is the disparity between global and local feature structures. While local structures typically show strong consistency and compactness within class samples, global features often present intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in designed to enhance the global feature structures of current deep clustering models. By harnessing reliable local structural cues, our method aims to elevate clustering performance effectively. Specifically, we first identify high-confidence samples through adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, aiming to select a sufficient number of samples with high label reliability to serve as trustworthy anchors for self-supervision. Subsequently, these samples are utilized to compute a discriminative loss, which promotes both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, to guide network optimization. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets showcase that our DCBoost significantly improves the clustering performance of diverse existing deep clustering models. Notably, our method improves the performance of current state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., ProPos) by more than 3% and amplifies the silhouette coefficient by over $7\times$.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn rich, transferable representations across diverse modalities such as images, text, and audio. In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.

Result: 在广泛使用的动作识别基准测试中表现出优于先前最先进基线的性能。

Conclusion: ART框架通过跟踪局部区域动态，有效区分相似动作，在细粒度动作识别任务中取得优异表现。

Abstract: Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative study of three generative modeling paradigms: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), and MeanFlow. While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.

Conclusion: 提出的T3-Tracer是首个联合分析音频帧、片段和音频级的框架，能够全面检测伪造痕迹，有效解决了部分音频伪造检测的挑战。

Abstract: Recently, partial audio forgery has emerged as a new form of audio manipulation. Attackers selectively modify partial but semantically critical frames while preserving the overall perceptual authenticity, making such forgeries particularly difficult to detect. Existing methods focus on independently detecting whether a single frame is forged, lacking the hierarchical structure to capture both transient and sustained anomalies across different temporal levels. To address these limitations, We identify three key levels relevant to partial audio forgery detection and present T3-Tracer, the first framework that jointly analyzes audio at the frame, segment, and audio levels to comprehensively detect forgery traces. T3-Tracer consists of two complementary core modules: the Frame-Audio Feature Aggregation Module (FA-FAM) and the Segment-level Multi-Scale Discrepancy-Aware Module (SMDAM). FA-FAM is designed to detect the authenticity of each audio frame. It combines both frame-level and audio-level temporal information to detect intra-frame forgery cues and global semantic inconsistencies. To further refine and correct frame detection, we introduce SMDAM to detect forgery boundaries at the segment level. It adopts a dual-branch architecture that jointly models frame features and inter-frame differences across multi-scale temporal windows, effectively identifying abrupt anomalies that appeared on the forged boundaries. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Facial expressions convey the bulk of emotional information in human communication, yet existing 3D face reconstruction methods often miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth. We propose FIELDS (Face reconstruction with accurate Inference of Expression using Learning with Direct Supervision) to address these limitations by extending self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch. Our encoder is guided by authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D facial scans, while an intensity-aware emotion loss encourages the 3D expression parameters to capture genuine emotion content without exaggeration. This dual-supervision strategy bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, yielding high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues. From a single image, FIELDS produces emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable performance in recent years on various computer vision problems. However, the traditional convolutional neural network architecture lacks a critical property: shift equivariance and invariance, broken by downsampling and upsampling operations. Although data augmentation techniques can help the model learn the latter property empirically, a consistent and systematic way to achieve this goal is by designing downsampling and upsampling layers that theoretically guarantee these properties by construction. Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS) introduced the cornerstone for shift invariance, later extended to shift equivariance with Learnable Polyphase up/downsampling (LPS) applied to real-valued neural networks. In this paper, we extend the work on LPS to complex-valued neural networks both from a theoretical perspective and with a novel building block of a projection layer from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ before the Gumbel Softmax. We finally evaluate this extension on several computer vision problems, specifically for either the invariance property in classification tasks or the equivariance property in both reconstruction and semantic segmentation problems, using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar images.

Abstract: The threat of Audio-Video (AV) forgery is rapidly evolving beyond human-centric deepfakes to include more diverse manipulations across complex natural scenes. However, existing benchmarks are still confined to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, thus failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world forgery scenarios. To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning. We evaluate 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 prevalent detection methods on AVFakeBench, demonstrating the potential of AV-LMMs as emerging forgery detectors while revealing their notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.

Motivation: 现有LiDAR数据生成方法仅支持单帧生成，而预测方法需要多帧历史输入且只能确定性预测多帧，缺乏交互性，两者都无法支持长时程交互生成。

Method: 提出LaGen框架，包含场景解耦估计模块增强对象级内容的交互生成能力，以及噪声调制模块减轻长时程生成中的误差累积。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验结果表明，LaGen在长时程LiDAR场景生成方面优于现有最先进的LiDAR生成和预测模型，特别是在后续帧上表现更佳。

Conclusion: LaGen成功实现了长时程LiDAR场景的逐帧自回归生成，为自动驾驶中的生成式世界建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative world models for autonomous driving (AD) have become a trending topic. Unlike the widely studied image modality, in this work we explore generative world models for LiDAR data. Existing generation methods for LiDAR data only support single frame generation, while existing prediction approaches require multiple frames of historical input and can only deterministically predict multiple frames at once, lacking interactivity. Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation. We construct a protocol based on nuScenes for evaluating long-horizon LiDAR scene generation. Experimental results comprehensively demonstrate LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on the later frames.

*Juncheng Chen,Chao Xu,Yanjun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatchGS是一个利用3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)生成高质量图像匹配训练数据的框架，通过几何校正和2D-3D表示对齐，显著提升了零样本图像匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的图像匹配方法严重依赖大规模、多样化且几何准确的训练数据。3DGS虽然能实现逼真的新视角合成，但其几何不准确性和深度渲染偏差阻碍了鲁棒对应关系标注。

Method: 1) 几何忠实的数据生成流水线，通过细化3DGS几何来生成高精度对应标签；2) 2D-3D表示对齐策略，将3DGS的显式3D知识注入2D匹配器，引导其学习视角不变的3D表示。

Result: 生成的对应关系将极线误差降低了40倍，在公共基准测试中使最先进的匹配器实现了高达17.7%的零样本性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过适当的几何细化，3DGS可以成为可扩展、高保真且结构丰富的数据源，为新一代鲁棒零样本图像匹配器铺平道路。

Abstract: Learning-based image matching critically depends on large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis and thus is attractive for data generation. However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%. Our work demonstrates that with proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source, paving the way for a new generation of robust zero-shot image matchers.

Motivation: 随着Transformer在单个遥感任务上的出色表现，现在需要开发能够通过多任务学习在多个任务上表现出色的统一模型，以提供更好的泛化性、可扩展性和实用性。

Method: 创建数据管理引擎处理复杂遥感数据环境，提出统一动态分辨率策略处理不同图像尺度，引入Zoom-in Chain机制处理超高分辨率图像，并增强目标检测能力。

Conclusion: 该基线模型将推动通用遥感模型的进一步发展，所有训练评估工具、模型权重和数据集均已开源以支持可复现性。

Abstract: With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.

TL;DR: PathMamba是一种混合架构，结合了Mamba的顺序建模和Transformer的全局推理，用于卫星图像道路分割，在保持拓扑连续性的同时实现高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Vision Transformer的方法虽然能捕捉全局上下文，但二次复杂度限制了在资源受限平台上的部署效率。Mamba等状态空间模型具有线性时间效率，适合建模长连续结构，两者具有互补优势。

Method: 设计混合架构，策略性地使用Mamba块追踪道路网络的连续性质，保持拓扑结构，同时集成Transformer块通过全局上下文细化特征。

Result: 在DeepGlobe Road Extraction和Massachusetts Roads数据集上的实验表明，PathMamba达到了新的最先进水平，显著提高了拓扑连续性（APLS指标），同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: PathMamba通过结合Mamba和Transformer的互补优势，在道路分割任务中实现了拓扑优越的分割结果，避免了纯注意力模型的高昂扩展成本。

Abstract: Achieving both high accuracy and topological continuity in road segmentation from satellite imagery is a critical goal for applications ranging from urban planning to disaster response. State-of-the-art methods often rely on Vision Transformers, which excel at capturing global context, yet their quadratic complexity is a significant barrier to efficient deployment, particularly for on-board processing in resource-constrained platforms. In contrast, emerging State Space Models like Mamba offer linear-time efficiency and are inherently suited to modeling long, continuous structures. We posit that these architectures have complementary strengths. To this end, we introduce PathMamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba's sequential modeling with the Transformer's global reasoning. Our design strategically uses Mamba blocks to trace the continuous nature of road networks, preserving topological structure, while integrating Transformer blocks to refine features with global context. This approach yields topologically superior segmentation maps without the prohibitive scaling costs of pure attention-based models. Our experiments on the DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets demonstrate that PathMamba sets a new state-of-the-art. Notably, it significantly improves topological continuity, as measured by the APLS metric, setting a new benchmark while remaining computationally competitive.

TL;DR: CaliTex是一个解决3D纹理生成中跨视角不一致问题的框架，通过几何校准注意力机制来显式对齐3D结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的3D纹理生成系统存在跨视角不一致问题，即从一个视角看起来合理的纹理在其他视角无法对齐，这源于注意力模糊问题

Method: 引入几何校准注意力框架，包含两个模块：部分对齐注意力（强制空间对齐）和条件路由注意力（通过几何条件路径路由外观信息），结合两阶段扩散变换器

Result: CaliTex能够生成无缝且视角一致的纹理，在性能上优于开源和商业基线方法

Conclusion: 通过将几何一致性作为网络的固有行为而非优化的副产品，CaliTex有效解决了3D纹理生成中的跨视角不一致问题

Abstract: Despite major advances brought by diffusion-based models, current 3D texture generation systems remain hindered by cross-view inconsistency -- textures that appear convincing from one viewpoint often fail to align across others. We find that this issue arises from attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention is applied indiscriminately across tokens and modalities, causing geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling. To address this, we introduce CaliTex, a framework of geometry-calibrated attention that explicitly aligns attention with 3D structure. It introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention which routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways to maintain spatial fidelity. Coupled with a two-stage diffusion transformer, CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization. Empirically, CaliTex produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HTTM方法，一种无需训练的3D token合并技术，用于加速VGGT模型在大型场景重建中的推理速度，通过多头粒度的token合并实现7倍加速且性能损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VGGT模型在大型场景重建时，由于全局注意力机制需要处理所有视图的token，导致严重的延迟瓶颈。现有合并方法在不同注意力头中统一合并token，会降低模型表示能力。

Method: HTTM采用多头粒度的token合并方法，在多头级别合并token，保持特征token在头连接后的独特性，并利用头级别的空间局部性和时间对应性实现更高合并比。

Result: 在GPU推理中实现了最高7倍的加速，性能下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: HTTM是一种有效的训练免费加速方法，解决了VGGT在长序列输入时的延迟问题，同时保持了模型的表示能力。

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) marks a significant leap forward in 3D scene reconstruction, as it is the first model that directly infers all key 3D attributes (camera poses, depths, and dense geometry) jointly in one pass. However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.

Conclusion: ConFu框架能有效捕获高阶依赖同时保持成对对应关系，为多模态学习提供统一的对比学习解决方案。

Abstract: Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.

Motivation: 解决传统CNN方法在实时结构安全监测中延迟高、功耗大、可解释性差的问题，开发适合边缘部署的低延迟、低功耗检测系统。

Method: 集成SIFT进行空间特征编码，使用延迟驱动的脉冲转换层和LIF SNN进行分类，在多种天气和光照条件下采集6000帧数据并包含合成增强的不安全案例。

Result: 分类准确率92.3%(±0.8%)，每帧推理时间9.5ms，稀疏脉冲活动8.1%，支持实时低功耗边缘部署，相比CNN方法具有更好的空间特征保持和可解释性。

Conclusion: SIFT-SNN框架在消费级系统上验证有效，作为可移动混凝土护栏结构安全监测的通用案例研究，虽然合成增强提高了鲁棒性，但在未见现场条件下的泛化能力仍需验证。

Abstract: This paper presents the SIFT-SNN framework, a low-latency neuromorphic signal-processing pipeline for real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure. The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their potential for medical and surgical applications. However, existing surgical datasets predominantly adopt a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format with heterogeneous taxonomies and lack support for pixel-level segmentation, limiting consistent evaluation and applicability. We present SurgMLLMBench, a unified multimodal benchmark explicitly designed for developing and evaluating interactive multimodal LLMs for surgical scene understanding, including the newly collected Micro-surgical Artificial Vascular anastomosIS (MAVIS) dataset. It integrates pixel-level instrument segmentation masks and structured VQA annotations across laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and micro-surgical domains under a unified taxonomy, enabling comprehensive evaluation beyond traditional VQA tasks and richer visual-conversational interactions. Extensive baseline experiments show that a single model trained on SurgMLLMBench achieves consistent performance across domains and generalizes effectively to unseen datasets. SurgMLLMBench will be publicly released as a robust resource to advance multimodal surgical AI research, supporting reproducible evaluation and development of interactive surgical reasoning models.

Conclusion: 基于多尺度特征聚合的近似策略使模型能够实现不同局部补丁的尺度自适应，并提供最优特征描述。

Abstract: Estimating the normal of a point requires constructing a local patch to provide center-surrounding context, but determining the appropriate neighborhood size is difficult when dealing with different data or geometries. Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and running time.

TL;DR: Endo-G²T是一个几何引导和时间感知的训练方案，用于解决内窥镜视频中4D高斯溅射的几何漂移问题，通过几何先验蒸馏、时间嵌入高斯场和关键帧约束流式处理来实现高质量的动态重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜视频存在强烈的视角依赖效应，纯光度监督会导致几何漂移，错误的形状在密集化过程中被强化且难以纠正。需要早期锚定几何形状，同时保持时间一致性和效率。

Method: 1. 几何引导先验蒸馏：将置信度门控的单目深度转换为监督信号，使用尺度不变深度和深度梯度损失；2. 时间嵌入高斯场：在XYZT中表示动态，采用转子式旋转参数化；3. 关键帧约束流式处理：在最大点数预算下进行关键帧优化，非关键帧进行轻量更新。

Result: 在EndoNeRF和StereoMIS-P1数据集上，Endo-G²T在单目重建基线中达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了内窥镜场景中4D高斯溅射的几何漂移问题，实现了时间一致的高质量动态重建，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Endoscopic (endo) video exhibits strong view-dependent effects such as specularities, wet reflections, and occlusions. Pure photometric supervision misaligns with geometry and triggers early geometric drift, where erroneous shapes are reinforced during densification and become hard to correct. We ask how to anchor geometry early for 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes. Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries. Third, keyframe-constrained streaming improves efficiency and long-horizon stability through keyframe-focused optimization under a max-points budget, while non-keyframes advance with lightweight updates. Across EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets, Endo-G$^{2}$T achieves state-of-the-art results among monocular reconstruction baselines.

Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型具有强大的语言理解能力，但由于训练目标不对齐和标准视觉编码器中细粒度区域-词语对齐较弱，它们在时空视频定位任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出边界框思维链机制，在最终预测前明确推理时空位置；设计包含格式、一致性、时间、空间和思考奖励的多维度强化奖励函数，通过强化微调提供几何感知监督。

Result: 在HCSTVG-v1/v2和VidSTG数据集上评估，STVG-o1在HCSTVG上创下新记录，比最佳任务特定方法在HCSTVG-v1上提升7.3% m_tIoU，在VidSTG上与专用模型匹配，大幅超越所有现有基于MLLM的方法。

Conclusion: STVG-o1证明了多模态大语言模型可以成为精确时空定位任务中可行且强大的骨干网络，并展现出强大的跨数据集开放词汇泛化能力。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires localizing a target object in untrimmed videos both temporally and spatially from natural language descriptions. Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.

Abstract: "Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning.

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）在文本嵌入中注入噪声以增强多样性；2）提出尺度旅行技术，利用多尺度自编码器提取粗尺度标记，在中间阶段恢复生成以保持图像质量。

Result: 实验表明，文本嵌入噪声注入与尺度旅行优化相结合，能显著增强多样性同时最小化图像质量损失，在多样性-质量权衡中达到了新的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: DiverseVAR框架有效解决了VAR模型的多样性限制问题，无需额外训练成本，为文本条件图像生成提供了更好的多样性-质量平衡。

Abstract: We introduce DiverseVAR, a framework that enhances the diversity of text-conditioned visual autoregressive models (VAR) at test time without requiring retraining, fine-tuning, or substantial computational overhead. While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.

Abstract: Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: E-M3RF是一个等变多模态3D重组框架，通过结合几何和颜色特征来解决传统方法在几何信息不足时的重组困难，使用SE(3)流匹配预测碎片变换，在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D重组方法主要依赖几何特征，但在几何信息不足（如碎片小、腐蚀或对称）时效果不佳，且缺乏防止重叠组装的物理约束。需要多模态方法来提升重组准确性。

Conclusion: E-M3RF通过结合几何和颜色多模态特征，有效解决了传统方法在几何信息不足时的重组困难，显著提升了3D重组的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: 3D reassembly is a fundamental geometric problem, and in recent years it has increasingly been challenged by deep learning methods rather than classical optimization. While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.

Abstract: Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Abstract: Recently, video generation has witnessed rapid advancements, drawing increasing attention to image-to-video (I2V) synthesis on mobile devices. However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hustvl/MobileI2V.

Conclusion: 提出的频率感知token缩减策略在保持性能的同时提高了计算效率，并对先前方法的隐式频率特性和局限性进行了分析。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks, yet their quadratic computational complexity concerning token length remains a significant challenge. To address this, token reduction methods have been widely explored. However, existing approaches often overlook the frequency characteristics of self-attention, such as rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.

Motivation: 解决类增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，通过直接优化模型权重来保持旧任务知识，同时有效学习新任务。

Method: 使用两种权重合并：任务间合并（平均所有先前阶段模型权重）和任务内合并（组合当前阶段模型参数），配合有界更新技术限制累积更新。

Result: 在标准CIL基准测试中表现出色，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: M&B方法无需修改架构或学习目标即可集成到现有CIL方法中，有效减少灾难性遗忘，实现优越的增量学习性能。

Abstract: We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统自注意力蒸馏方法独立对齐师生特征图，无法充分捕捉像素间关系。需要更有效的非局部知识迁移机制来提升特征表示学习。

Method: 使用交叉注意力机制，让学生特征图的每个像素都能动态关注教师特征图的所有像素位置，仅通过额外损失函数实现知识蒸馏。

Result: 在目标检测和图像分割任务上的大量实验表明，CanKD优于现有的特征和混合蒸馏方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CanKD作为一种新的注意力引导蒸馏范式，在计算机视觉任务中展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: We propose Cross-Attention-based Non-local Knowledge Distillation (CanKD), a novel feature-based knowledge distillation framework that leverages cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the knowledge transfer process. Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods. Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation tasks demonstrate that CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods. These experimental results highlight CanKD's potential as a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/tori-hotaru/CanKD

Abstract: The effectiveness of deepfake detection methods often depends less on their core design and more on implementation details such as data preprocessing, augmentation strategies, and optimization techniques. These factors make it difficult to fairly compare detectors and to understand which factors truly contribute to their performance. To address this, we systematically investigate how different design choices influence the accuracy and generalization capabilities of deepfake detection models, focusing on aspects related to training, inference, and incremental updates. By isolating the impact of individual factors, we aim to establish robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for the design and development of future deepfake detection systems.

Conclusion: 该框架克服了传统MIML方法的限制，支持端到端优化，在ANA检测和医疗MIML任务中实现了最先进的性能，为临床自动化诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is a crucial method for diagnosing autoimmune disorders, including lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, and scleroderma. Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown great promise in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, and similar efforts are now emerging in the Earth Observation community. These models aim to generalize across tasks with limited supervision, reducing the need for training separate models for each task. However, current strategies, which largely focus on scaling model size and dataset volume, require prohibitive computational and data resources, limiting accessibility to only a few large institutions. Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility. Moreover, it naturally supports federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration, making it particularly well-suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings. Our framework sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient RSFMs.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating disorder marked by a decline in cognitive function. Timely identification of the disease is essential for the development of personalized treatment strategies that aim to mitigate its progression. The application of generated images for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease poses challenges, particularly in accurately representing the disease's characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals. This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis. Furthermore, the application of age-scaled pixel loss contributed to the enhanced iterative generation of MRI images. In terms of long-term disease prognosis, the Structural Similarity Index reached a peak value of 0.882, indicating a substantial degree of similarity in the synthesized images.

Abstract: Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

Abstract: Illumination inconsistency is a fundamental challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction. Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.

Conclusion: 提出了一种通过高效利用多模态知识构建鲁棒3D视觉系统的新实用范式

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合2D/3D地标配准的U-Net训练框架，用于骨盆透视图像中的地标检测，解决了传统方法假设固定前后位视图的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前骨盆透视地标检测方法大多假设固定的前后位视图，但实际手术中由于成像设备或目标结构重定位，方向经常偏离标准视图。

Method: 将2D/3D地标配准集成到U-Net地标预测模型的训练中，比较了基线U-Net、带姿态估计损失的U-Net训练以及带姿态估计损失的U-Net微调三种方法。

Result: 在患者姿态变化的实际手术条件下评估了地标检测精度。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够处理骨盆透视图像中姿态变化的问题，提高了地标检测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.

<details>

Motivation: 开源模型在音频-视频对齐方面存在挑战，主要源于联合扩散过程中的三个基本问题：对应漂移、低效的全局注意力机制以及传统CFG的模态内偏差

Method: 1. 交叉任务协同训练范式，利用音频驱动视频和视频驱动音频生成任务的强监督信号；2. 全局-局部解耦交互模块，实现高效精确的时序风格对齐；3. 同步增强CFG，在推理时显式分离和放大对齐信号

Conclusion: Harmony通过机制性地强制音频-视频同步，有效解决了联合扩散过程中的核心挑战，为同步音频-视觉内容合成提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: The synthesis of synchronized audio-visual content is a key challenge in generative AI, with open-source models facing challenges in robust audio-video alignment. Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

Method: 结合分层数据分割、高级数据增强和过采样技术来构建多分类器，解决有限和不平衡数据集的挑战。

Result: 实验结果显示83.33%准确率、89.12%精确率和77.31%召回率，优于现有最先进方法，特别是在少数类分类方面表现显著。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了过采样和增强策略在少数类分类中的有效性，是构建可信赖的计算机辅助诊断系统用于口腔癌早期检测的有前景的第一步。

Abstract: Oral cancer is highly common across the globe and is mostly diagnosed during the later stages due to the close visual similarity to benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions in the oral cavity. Implementing computer aided diagnosis systems early on has the potential to greatly improve clinical outcomes. This research intends to use deep learning to build a multiclass classifier for sixteen different oral lesions. To overcome the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets, the proposed technique combines stratified data splitting and advanced data augmentation and oversampling to perform the classification. The experimental results, which achieved 83.33 percent accuracy, 89.12 percent precision, and 77.31 percent recall, demonstrate the superiority of the suggested model over state of the art methods now in use. The suggested model effectively conveys the effectiveness of oversampling and augmentation strategies in situations where the minority class classification performance is noteworthy. As a first step toward trustworthy computer aided diagnostic systems for the early detection of oral cancer in clinical settings, the suggested framework shows promise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGAN是一个专注于提升视频生成运动质量的训练后框架，通过光学流判别器和分布匹配正则化器，在不牺牲视觉保真度的情况下显著改善运动真实感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型在帧级保真度方面表现良好，但在运动连贯性、动态性和真实感方面存在不足，经常产生抖动、重影或不合理的动态。标准的去噪MSE目标缺乏对时间一致性的直接监督，导致模型即使损失较低仍生成不良运动。

Method: 基于3步蒸馏视频扩散模型，训练基于DiT的光学流判别器来区分真实与生成的运动，结合分布匹配正则化器以保持视觉保真度。

Result: 在VBench上，MoGAN比50步教师模型提升运动得分7.3%，比3步DMD模型提升13.3%；在VideoJAM-Bench上分别提升7.4%和8.8%，同时保持相当或更好的美学和图像质量得分。人类研究显示MoGAN在运动质量上更受偏好。

Conclusion: MoGAN在不牺牲视觉保真度或效率的情况下，提供了显著更真实的运动，为快速高质量视频生成提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Video diffusion models achieve strong frame-level fidelity but still struggle with motion coherence, dynamics and realism, often producing jitter, ghosting, or implausible dynamics. A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自提示、点监督的框架，仅使用稀疏点标注来将SAM适配到遥感图像，通过Refine-Requery-Reinforce循环逐步提升分割质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM在自然图像上表现优异，但在遥感图像上由于严重的领域偏移和密集标注稀缺而表现不佳，需要一种仅依赖稀疏点标注的适配方法。

Method: 采用Refine-Requery-Reinforce循环：从初始点生成粗伪掩码(Refine)，使用自构建的框提示改进(Requery)，并通过嵌入对齐减少确认偏差(Reinforce)。

Result: 在WHU、HRSID和NWPU VHR-10三个遥感图像基准数据集上评估，方法持续超越预训练SAM和最近的点监督分割方法。

Conclusion: 自提示和语义对齐为遥感应用中基础分割模型的可扩展点级适配提供了高效路径。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated remarkable generalization on natural images, but perform suboptimally on remote sensing imagery (RSI) due to severe domain shift and the scarcity of dense annotations. To address this, we propose a self-prompting, point-supervised framework that adapts SAM to RSIs using only sparse point annotations. Our method employs a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop, where coarse pseudo-masks are generated from initial points (Refine), improved with self-constructed box prompts (Requery), and embeddings are aligned across iterations to reduce confirmation bias (Reinforce). Without relying on full-mask supervision, our approach progressively enhances SAM's segmentation quality and domain robustness through self-guided prompt adaptation . We evaluate our proposed method on three RSI benchmark datasets, including WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10, showing that our method consistently surpasses pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised segmentation methods. Our results demonstrate that self-prompting and semantic alignment provide an efficient path towards scalable, point-level adaptation of foundation segmentation models for remote sensing applications.

Conclusion: 提出的标签高效GCN模型能够有效减少对标注数据的依赖，在骨架动作识别任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Despite the notable success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in skeleton-based action recognition, their performance often depends on large volumes of labeled data, which are frequently scarce in practical settings. To address this limitation, we propose a novel label-efficient GCN model. Our work makes two primary contributions. First, we develop a novel acquisition function that employs an adversarial strategy to identify a compact set of informative exemplars for labeling. This selection process balances representativeness, diversity, and uncertainty. Second, we introduce bidirectional and stable GCN architectures. These enhanced networks facilitate a more effective mapping between the ambient and latent data spaces, enabling a better understanding of the learned exemplar distribution. Extensive evaluations on two challenging skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks reveal significant improvements achieved by our label-efficient GCNs compared to prior work.

Conclusion: Qwen3-VL可作为现实工作流程中图像推理、智能决策和多模态代码智能的基础引擎，在密集型和混合专家架构下都能在可比token预算和延迟约束下实现优越性能。

Abstract: We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI models in everyday devices has highlighted a critical challenge: prediction errors that degrade user experience. While existing solutions focus on error detection, they rarely provide efficient correction mechanisms, especially for resource-constrained devices. We present a novel system enabling users to correct AI misclassifications through few-shot learning, requiring minimal computational resources and storage. Our approach combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, enabling efficient error correction through prototype updates rather than model retraining. The system consists of two key components: (1) a server-side pipeline that leverages knowledge distillation to transfer robust feature representations from foundation models to device-compatible architectures, and (2) a device-side mechanism that enables ultra-efficient error correction through prototype adaptation. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead. Our implementation, validated through an Android demonstration app, proves the system's practicality in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: CaFlow是一个用于长时动作质量评估的统一框架，结合了反事实去混淆和双向时间条件流，通过因果反事实正则化和双向流模块提升长期时序建模的鲁棒性和连贯性。


<details>

Motivation: 长时动作质量评估（如花样滑冰、艺术体操）需要建模长期时序动态，同时保持对上下文混淆因素的鲁棒性。现有方法依赖昂贵标注或单向时序建模，容易受到伪相关性和不稳定长期表示的影响。

Method: 提出CaFlow框架：1）因果反事实正则化（CCR）模块以自监督方式解耦因果特征和混淆特征，通过反事实干预增强因果鲁棒性；2）BiT-Flow模块通过循环一致性约束建模前向和后向动态，生成更平滑连贯的表示。

Result: 在多个长时AQA基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CaFlow达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CaFlow通过整合反事实去混淆和双向时序建模，有效解决了长时动作质量评估中的时序动态建模和上下文混淆问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) predicts fine-grained execution scores from action videos and is widely applied in sports, rehabilitation, and skill evaluation. Long-term AQA, as in figure skating or rhythmic gymnastics, is especially challenging since it requires modeling extended temporal dynamics while remaining robust to contextual confounders. Existing approaches either depend on costly annotations or rely on unidirectional temporal modeling, making them vulnerable to spurious correlations and unstable long-term representations. To this end, we propose CaFlow, a unified framework that integrates counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional time-conditioned flow. The Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) module disentangles causal and confounding features in a self-supervised manner and enforces causal robustness through counterfactual interventions, while the BiT-Flow module models forward and backward dynamics with a cycle-consistency constraint to produce smoother and more coherent representations. Extensive experiments on multiple long-term AQA benchmarks demonstrate that CaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/Harrison21/CaFlow

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型越来越多地被用作多模态评估系统的评判者，但它们遵循多样化、细粒度评估标准的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 开发Multi-Crit基准，通过严格的数据筛选流程收集具有多标准人工标注的挑战性响应对，并引入三个新指标系统评估多元标准遵循、标准切换灵活性和识别标准级偏好冲突的能力。

Result: 对25个LMMs的综合分析显示：1)专有模型在保持对多元标准的一致性遵循方面仍有困难；2)开源模型在灵活遵循多样化标准方面更落后；3)批评微调能增强视觉基础但无法泛化到多元标准级判断。

Conclusion: Multi-Crit为构建可靠且可操控的多模态AI评估奠定了基础，揭示了当前多模态评判者的局限性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) are increasingly adopted as judges in multimodal evaluation systems due to their strong instruction following and consistency with human preferences. However, their ability to follow diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria remains underexplored. We develop Multi-Crit, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal judges on their capacity to follow pluralistic criteria and produce reliable criterion-level judgments. Covering both open-ended generation and verifiable reasoning tasks, Multi-Crit is built through a rigorous data curation pipeline that gathers challenging response pairs with multi-criterion human annotations. It further introduces three novel metrics for systematically assessing pluralistic adherence, criterion-switching flexibility, and the ability to recognize criterion-level preference conflicts. Comprehensive analysis of 25 LMMs reveals that 1) proprietary models still struggle to maintain consistent adherence to pluralistic criteria--especially in open-ended evaluation; 2) open-source models lag further behind in flexibly following diverse criteria; and 3) critic fine-tuning with holistic judgment signals enhances visual grounding but fails to generalize to pluralistic criterion-level judgment. Additional analyses on reasoning fine-tuning, test-time scaling, and boundary consistency between open-source and proprietary models further probe the limits of current multimodal judges. As a pioneering study, Multi-Crit lays the foundation for building reliable and steerable multimodal AI evaluation.

TL;DR: ADVLA是一种针对视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型的对抗攻击框架，通过在视觉编码器到文本特征空间的投影特征上直接施加扰动，以低幅度约束有效干扰下游动作预测，同时通过注意力引导实现聚焦和稀疏的扰动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法需要昂贵的端到端训练，且往往生成明显的扰动补丁。为解决这些限制，需要开发更高效、更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 提出ADVLA框架，直接在视觉编码器投影到文本特征空间的特征上应用对抗扰动，引入三种策略增强敏感性、强制稀疏性和集中扰动，结合Top-K掩码实现局部稀疏攻击。

Result: 在L∞=4/255约束下，ADVLA结合Top-K掩码修改少于10%的补丁，攻击成功率接近100%。扰动集中在关键区域，整体图像几乎不可察觉，单步迭代仅需约0.06秒，显著优于传统基于补丁的攻击方法。

Conclusion: ADVLA在低幅度和局部稀疏条件下有效削弱VLA模型的下游动作预测，避免了传统补丁攻击的高训练成本和明显扰动，展示了攻击VLA特征空间的独特有效性和实用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied intelligence have developed rapidly. However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.

Abstract: Gliomas are brain tumor types that have a high mortality rate which means early and accurate diagnosis is important for therapeutic intervention for the tumors. To address this difficulty, the proposed research will develop a hybrid deep learning model which integrates U-Net based segmentation and a hybrid DenseNet-VGG classification network with multihead attention and spatial-channel attention capabilities. The segmentation model will precisely demarcate the tumors in a 3D volume of MRI data guided by spatial and contextual information. The classification network which combines a branch of both DenseNet and VGG, will incorporate the demarcated tumor on which features with attention mechanisms would be focused on clinically relevant features. High-dimensional 3D MRI data could successfully be utilized in the model through preprocessing steps which are normalization, resampling, and data augmentation. Through a variety of measures the framework is evaluated: measures of performance in segmentation are Dice coefficient and Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) and measures of performance in classification are accuracy precision, recall, and F1-score. The hybrid framework that has been proposed has demonstrated through physical testing that it has the capability of obtaining a Dice coefficient of 98% in tumor segmentation, and 99% on classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods. Utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms enhances notions of priority in aspects of the tumor that are clinically significant, and enhances interpretability and accuracy. The results suggest a great potential of the framework in facilitating the timely and reliable diagnosis and grading of glioma by clinicians is promising, allowing for better planning of patient treatment.

*Zihui Xue,Kristen Grauman,Dima Damen,Andrew Zisserman,Tengda Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究仅通过相机轨迹（而非像素）来感知视频内容的能力，发现相机轨迹是揭示视频内容的有效信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以不依赖像素信息，仅通过相机运动轨迹来理解视频内容，这是一个看似不可能但具有重要价值的问题。

Method: 提出对比学习框架训练CamFormer编码器，将相机姿态轨迹投影到联合嵌入空间，并与自然语言对齐。

Result: 相机轨迹是揭示视频内容的有效信号，CamFormer嵌入在跨模态对齐、分类和时间分析等任务中表现优异，且对不同的相机姿态估计方法具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 相机轨迹是一种轻量级、鲁棒且多功能的模态，可用于感知视频内容。

Abstract: Can one perceive a video's content without seeing its pixels, just from the camera trajectory-the path it carves through space? This paper is the first to systematically investigate this seemingly implausible question. Towards this end, we propose a contrastive learning framework to train CamFormer, a dedicated encoder that projects camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space, aligning them with natural language. We find that, contrary to its apparent simplicity, the camera trajectory is a remarkably informative signal to uncover video content. In other words, "how you move" can indeed reveal "what you are doing" (egocentric) or "observing" (exocentric). We demonstrate the versatility of our learned CamFormer embeddings on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, ranging from cross-modal alignment to classification and temporal analysis. Importantly, our representations are robust across diverse camera pose estimation methods, including both high-fidelity multi-sensored and standard RGB-only estimators. Our findings establish camera trajectory as a lightweight, robust, and versatile modality for perceiving video content.

TL;DR: Canvas-to-Image是一个统一框架，将文本提示、主题参考、空间布局、姿态约束和布局注释等多种控制信号整合到单一画布界面中，通过多任务训练使扩散模型能够联合理解并集成异构控制信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代扩散模型在生成高质量多样化图像方面表现出色，但在高保真组合和多模态控制方面仍有困难，特别是当用户同时指定文本提示、主题参考、空间安排、姿态约束和布局注释时。

Method: 将多样控制信号编码到单一复合画布图像中，策划多任务数据集并提出多任务画布训练策略，在统一学习范式中优化扩散模型以联合理解和集成异构控制。

Result: 在具有挑战性的基准测试中，包括多人组合、姿态控制组合、布局约束生成和多控制生成，Canvas-to-Image在身份保持和控制遵循方面显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 联合训练使Canvas-to-Image能够跨多个控制模态进行推理，而不仅仅依赖特定任务的启发式方法，并且在推理过程中能够很好地泛化到多控制场景。

Abstract: While modern diffusion models excel at generating high-quality and diverse images, they still struggle with high-fidelity compositional and multimodal control, particularly when users simultaneously specify text prompts, subject references, spatial arrangements, pose constraints, and layout annotations. We introduce Canvas-to-Image, a unified framework that consolidates these heterogeneous controls into a single canvas interface, enabling users to generate images that faithfully reflect their intent. Our key idea is to encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret for integrated visual-spatial reasoning. We further curate a suite of multi-task datasets and propose a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy that optimizes the diffusion model to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls into text-to-image generation within a unified learning paradigm. This joint training enables Canvas-to-Image to reason across multiple control modalities rather than relying on task-specific heuristics, and it generalizes well to multi-control scenarios during inference. Extensive experiments show that Canvas-to-Image significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and control adherence across challenging benchmarks, including multi-person composition, pose-controlled composition, layout-constrained generation, and multi-control generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着云存储平台在学术和商业环境中的普及，可靠性成为关键需求。特别是对于寻求公共云服务替代方案的组织，评估这些系统的可靠性至关重要。

Method: 使用随机Petri网（SPNs）建模方法，在Apache CloudStack托管的私有云环境中分析Nextcloud文件服务器的可用性，评估了四种架构配置：基线配置、主机级冗余、虚拟机冗余以及两者的组合。

Result: 结果显示，在主机和虚拟机级别同时实施冗余策略能显著提高系统可用性并减少预期停机时间。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法为评估私有云可用性和支持基础设施设计决策提供了一种有效手段。

Abstract: Cloud-based storage platforms are becoming more common in both academic and business settings due to their flexible access to data and support for collaborative functionalities. As reliability becomes a vital requirement, particularly for organizations looking for alternatives to public cloud services, assessing the dependability of these systems is crucial. This paper presents a methodology for analyzing the availability of a file server (Nextcloud) hosted in a private cloud environment using Apache CloudStack. The analysis is based on a modeling approach through Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) that allows the evaluation of different redundancy strategies to enhance the availability of such systems. Four architectural configurations were modeled, including the baseline, host-level redundancy, virtual machine (VM) redundancy, and a combination of both. The results show that redundancy at both the host and VM levels significantly improves availability and reduces expected downtime. The proposed approach provides a method to evaluate the availability of a private cloud and support infrastructure design decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的稀疏卷积引擎没有充分利用体素坐标的三个关键特性（整数值、空间有界性、几何连续性），导致在核映射构建过程中存在高预处理和后处理开销。

Method: Spira设计了四种关键技术：一次性搜索算法构建核映射、压缩原生处理方案访问体素坐标、双数据流执行机制适应层特性、网络级并行化策略并发构建所有层核映射。

Result: Spira在端到端推理上平均提升1.71倍（最高2.31倍），在逐层执行上平均提升2.13倍（最高3.32倍）。

Conclusion: Spira通过充分利用体素坐标特性，显著提升了稀疏卷积在GPU上的计算效率，为3D点云网络提供了高性能解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse Convolution (SpC) powers 3D point cloud networks widely used in autonomous driving and AR/VR. SpC builds a kernel map that stores mappings between input voxel coordinates, output coordinates, and weight offsets, then uses this map to compute feature vectors for output coordinates. Our work identifies three key properties of voxel coordinates: they are integer-valued, bounded within a limited spatial range, and geometrically continuous-neighboring voxels on the same object surface are highly likely to exist at small spatial offsets from each other. Prior SpC engines do not fully exploit these properties and suffer from high pre-processing and post-processing overheads during kernel map construction. To address this, we design Spira, the first voxel-property-aware SpC engine for GPUs. Spira proposes: (i) a high-performance one-shot search algorithm that builds the kernel map with no preprocessing and high memory locality, (ii) an effective packed-native processing scheme that accesses packed voxel coordinates at low cost, (iii) a flexible dual-dataflow execution mechanism that efficiently computes output feature vectors by adapting to layer characteristics, and (iv) a network-wide parallelization strategy that builds kernel maps for all SpC layers concurrently at network start. Our evaluation shows that Spira significantly outperforms prior SpC engines by 1.71x on average and up to 2.31x for end-to-end inference, and by 2.13x on average and up to 3.32x for layer-wise execution across diverse layer configurations.

TL;DR: Aragog系统通过动态调整工作流配置来优化LLM推理成本，在保持精度的同时显著提升吞吐量和降低延迟


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的固定配置方法无法适应工作流执行期间系统负载的快速变化，导致配置很快变得次优

Method: 将问题解耦为一次性路由步骤识别所有保持精度的配置，以及基于实时系统观测的廉价每阶段调度器

Result: 在不同工作流和模型家族中，Aragog将最大服务吞吐量提高50.0-217.0%，中位延迟降低32.5-78.9%

Conclusion: Aragog通过运行时动态配置适应，在保持精度的同时显著提升了工作流服务的效率和性能

Abstract: Agentic workflows have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multi-stage tasks, but serving them at scale is computationally expensive given the many LLM inferences that each request must pass through. Configuration selection, or the cost-aware assignment of workflow agents to specific LLMs, can reduce these costs, but existing approaches bind configuration decisions before request execution, making them ill-suited for the heterogeneous and lengthy execution of workflows. Specifically, system loads can fluctuate rapidly and substantially during a request's lifetime, causing fixed configurations to quickly become suboptimal. We present Aragog, a system that progressively adapts a request's configuration throughout its execution to match runtime dynamics. To make this practical despite the massive space of workflow configurations, Aragog decouples the problem into two core elements -- a one-time routing step that identifies all accuracy-preserving configurations, and a cheap per-stage scheduler that selects among them using up-to-date system observations -- and introduces novel strategies to accelerate each. Across diverse workflows and model families, Aragog increases maximum serving throughput by 50.0--217.0\% and reduces median latency by 32.5--78.9\% at peak request rates, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the most expensive configurations.

TL;DR: DOPD是一个动态LLM推理系统，通过实时监控负载动态调整预填充和解码实例分配比例，解决异构工作负载下的生产者-消费者不平衡问题，显著提升系统吞吐量和降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM系统将预填充和解码阶段分离到不同GPU上，但异构工作负载导致两个实例类型间的生产者-消费者不平衡，影响SLO达成。

Method: 提出DOPD系统，基于实时负载监控动态调整预填充与解码实例比例，结合适当的请求调度策略，解决实例不平衡和混合长度请求下的资源分配不匹配问题。

Result: 相比vLLM和DistServe，DOPD将系统吞吐量提升1.5倍，P90首token延迟降低67.5%，P90每输出token时间降低22.8%。

Conclusion: DOPD通过动态P/D比例调整和基于历史负载的主动重配置，使用更少额外资源实现超过99%的SLO达成率。

Abstract: To meet strict Service-Level Objectives (SLOs),contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) decouple the prefill and decoding stages and place them on separate GPUs to mitigate the distinct bottlenecks inherent to each phase. However, the heterogeneity of LLM workloads causes producerconsumer imbalance between the two instance types in such disaggregated architecture. To address this problem, we propose DOPD (Dynamic Optimal Prefill/Decoding), a dynamic LLM inference system that adjusts instance allocations to achieve an optimal prefill-to-decoding (P/D) ratio based on real-time load monitoring. Combined with an appropriate request-scheduling policy, DOPD effectively resolves imbalances between prefill and decoding instances and mitigates resource allocation mismatches due to mixed-length requests under high concurrency. Experimental evaluations show that, compared with vLLM and DistServe (representative aggregation-based and disaggregationbased approaches), DOPD improves overall system goodput by up to 1.5X, decreases P90 time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 67.5%, and decreases P90 time-per-output-token (TPOT) by up to 22.8%. Furthermore, our dynamic P/D adjustment technique performs proactive reconfiguration based on historical load, achieving over 99% SLOs attainment while using less additional resources.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RDMA技术无法容忍页面错误，通常采用内存固定方法，但这带来了编程复杂性、内存使用限制和效率低下等问题，且无法完全防止页面错误。

Method: 在ExaNeSt项目中，通过ARM SMMU检测页面错误，开发硬件-软件解决方案，包括修改Linux SMMU驱动、开发新软件库、调整DMA引擎硬件和调度逻辑。

Result: 在ExaNeSt的QFDB平台上进行了实验，评估了该机制并与内存固定和预错误处理等替代方案进行了比较。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的页面错误处理机制相比传统方法具有优势，能够更有效地处理RDMA通信中的页面错误问题。

Abstract: Nowadays, avoiding system calls during cluster communication (e.g., in Data Centers and High Performance Computing) in modern high-speed interconnection networks has become a necessity, due to the high overhead of multiple data copies between kernel and user space. User-level zero-copy Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technologies address this problem by improving performance and reducing system energy consumption. However, traditional RDMA engines cannot tolerate page faults and therefore use various techniques to avoid them.
  State-of-the-art RDMA approaches typically rely on pinning address spaces or multiple pages per application. This method introduces long-term disadvantages due to increased programming complexity (pinning and unpinning buffers), limits on how much memory can be pinned, and inefficient memory utilization. In addition, pinning does not fully prevent page faults because modern operating systems apply internal optimization mechanisms, such as Transparent Huge Pages (THP), which are enabled by default in Linux.
  This thesis implements a page-fault handling mechanism integrated with the DMA engine of the ExaNeSt project. Faults are detected by the ARM System Memory Management Unit (SMMU) and resolved through a hardware-software solution that can request retransmission when needed. This mechanism required modifications to the Linux SMMU driver, the development of a new software library, changes to the DMA engine hardware, and adjustments to the DMA scheduling logic. Experiments were conducted on the Quad-FPGA Daughter Board (QFDB) of ExaNeSt, which uses Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs.
  Finally, we evaluate our mechanism and compare it against alternatives such as pinning and pre-faulting, and discuss the advantages of our approach.

Abstract: Due to rising demands for Artificial Inteligence (AI) inference, especially in higher education, novel solutions utilising existing infrastructure are emerging. The utilisation of High-Performance Computing (HPC) has become a prevalent approach for the implementation of such solutions.

The initial benchmark indicates that the proposed architecture scales efficiently for 100, 500 and 1000 concurrent requests, incurring only an overhead of approximately 500 ms in terms of end-to-end latency.

Motivation: 大规模混合专家模型训练面临严重的内存瓶颈，动态令牌路由导致的负载不平衡会造成GPU内存溢出，限制了模型的可扩展性。现有的负载平衡方法会牺牲模型精度，且在内存受限的硬件上失效。

Method: 将令牌分布和专家计算分解为可管理的块，采用分块重计算策略，通过理论内存模型动态优化以平衡内存效率和吞吐量。

Result: 相比基于完全重计算的基线方法，MemFine减少了48.03%的激活内存，提高了4.42%的吞吐量。

Conclusion: MemFine能够在内存受限的GPU上实现稳定的大规模MoE训练，有效解决了内存瓶颈问题。

Abstract: The training of large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models faces a critical memory bottleneck due to severe load imbalance caused by dynamic token routing. This imbalance leads to memory overflow on GPUs with limited capacity, constraining model scalability. Existing load balancing methods, which cap expert capacity, compromise model accuracy and fail on memory-constrained hardware. To address this, we propose MemFine, a memory-aware fine-grained scheduling framework for MoE training. MemFine decomposes the token distribution and expert computation into manageable chunks and employs a chunked recomputation strategy, dynamically optimized through a theoretical memory model to balance memory efficiency and throughput. Experiments demonstrate that MemFine reduces activation memory by 48.03% and improves throughput by 4.42% compared to full recomputation-based baselines, enabling stable large-scale MoE training on memory-limited GPUs.

Motivation: MLFMA中的近场算子在GPU上由于内存局部性差成为性能瓶颈，需要改进内存访问模式。

Method: 引入数据冗余减少内存访问分散，提出基于局部性度量的分析模型预测性能趋势，并在两个MLFMA应用中验证。

Result: 内核加速最高达7倍，但端到端应用加速仅为1.04倍，模型能可靠捕捉不同问题规模和密度下的性能趋势。

Conclusion: 数据冗余可提升GPU上P2P算子性能，前提是局部性收益超过数据移动成本，且该技术易于集成到现有实现中。

Abstract: The near-field (P2P) operator in the Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA) is a performance bottleneck on GPUs due to poor memory locality. This work introduces data redundancy to improve spatial locality by reducing memory access dispersion. For validation of results, we propose an analytical model based on a Locality metric that combines data volume and access dispersion to predict speedup trends without hardware-specific profiling. The approach is validated on two MLFMA-based applications: an electromagnetic solver (DBIM-MLFMA) with regular structure, and a stellar dynamics code (PhotoNs-2.0) with irregular particle distribution. Results show up to 7X kernel speedup due to improved cache behavior. However, increased data volume raises overheads in data restructuring, limiting end-to-end application speedup to 1.04X. While the model cannot precisely predict absolute speedups, it reliably captures performance trends across different problem sizes and densities. The technique is injectable into existing implementations with minimal code changes. This work demonstrates that data redundancy can enhance GPU performance for P2P operator, provided locality gains outweigh data movement costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统云数据库将扩展视为二元决策（水平扩展或垂直扩展），这种一维视图限制了性能优化，导致系统对负载波动反应过度或不足，经常在次优状态间振荡。

Method: 引入扩展平面模型，将分布式数据库配置表示为点(H,V)，其中H是节点数，V是资源向量。提出DIAGONALSCALE算法，在扩展平面中评估水平、垂直和斜向移动，选择满足SLA约束下最小化多目标函数的配置。

Result: 实验表明斜向扩展相比仅水平或垂直扩展，能将p95延迟降低达40%，每查询成本降低达37%，重平衡减少2-5倍。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调需要多维扩展模型，为下一代云数据库自动扩展系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Modern cloud databases present scaling as a binary decision: scale-out by adding nodes or scale-up by increasing per-node resources. This one-dimensional view is limiting because database performance, cost, and coordination overhead emerge from the joint interaction of horizontal elasticity and per-node CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and storage IOPS. As a result, systems often overreact to load spikes, underreact to memory pressure, or oscillate between suboptimal states. We introduce the Scaling Plane, a two-dimensional model in which each distributed database configuration is represented as a point (H, V), with H denoting node count and V a vector of resources. Over this plane, we define smooth approximations of latency, throughput, coordination overhead, and monetary cost, providing a unified view of performance trade-offs. We show analytically and empirically that optimal scaling trajectories frequently lie along diagonal paths: sequences of joint horizontal and vertical adjustments that simultaneously exploit cluster parallelism and per-node improvements. To compute such actions, we propose DIAGONALSCALE, a discrete local-search algorithm that evaluates horizontal, vertical, and diagonal moves in the Scaling Plane and selects the configuration minimizing a multi-objective function subject to SLA constraints. Using synthetic surfaces, microbenchmarks, and experiments on distributed SQL and KV systems, we demonstrate that diagonal scaling reduces p95 latency by up to 40 percent, lowers cost-per-query by up to 37 percent, and reduces rebalancing by 2 to 5 times compared to horizontal-only and vertical-only autoscaling. Our results highlight the need for multi-dimensional scaling models and provide a foundation for next-generation autoscaling in cloud database systems.

Conclusion: MCP作为模型卡服务器接口在动态模型卡环境中具有独特价值，特别是在支持活动会话方面，尽管存在一定的性能开销。

Abstract: AI/ML model cards can contain a benchmarked evaluation of an AI/ML model against intended use but a one time assessment during model training does not get at how and where a model is actually used over its lifetime. Through Patra Model Cards embedded in the ICICLE AI Institute software ecosystem we study model cards as dynamic objects. The study reported here assesses the benefits and tradeoffs of adopting the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as an interface to the Patra Model Card server. Quantitative assessment shows the overhead of MCP as compared to a REST interface. The core question however is of active sessions enabled by MCP; this is a qualitative question of fit and use in the context of dynamic model cards that we address as well.

Conclusion: 验证了在TinyML资源约束内实现零缓冲区数据流的可行性，为边缘AI加速器克服内存墙提供了新颖有效的策略。

Abstract: The increasing demand for on-device intelligence in Edge AI and TinyML applications requires the efficient execution of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). While lightweight architectures like MobileNetV2 employ Depthwise Separable Convolutions (DSC) to reduce computational complexity, their multi-stage design introduces a critical performance bottleneck inherent to layer-by-layer execution: the high energy and latency cost of transferring intermediate feature maps to either large on-chip buffers or off-chip DRAM. To address this memory wall, this paper introduces a novel hardware accelerator architecture that utilizes a fused pixel-wise dataflow. Implemented as a Custom Function Unit (CFU) for a RISC-V processor, our architecture eliminates the need for intermediate buffers entirely, reducing the data movement up to 87\% compared to conventional layer-by-layer execution. It computes a single output pixel to completion across all DSC stages-expansion, depthwise convolution, and projection-by streaming data through a tightly-coupled pipeline without writing to memory. Evaluated on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, our design achieves a speedup of up to 59.3x over the baseline software execution on the RISC-V core. Furthermore, ASIC synthesis projects a compact 0.284 mm$^2$ footprint with 910 mW power at 2 GHz in 28 nm, and a 1.20 mm$^2$ footprint with 233 mW power at 300 MHz in 40 nm. This work confirms the feasibility of a zero-buffer dataflow within a TinyML resource envelope, offering a novel and effective strategy for overcoming the memory wall in edge AI accelerators.

In this paper, we present Bombyx, a compiler toolchain that lowers OpenCilk programs into a Cilk-1-inspired intermediate representation, enabling efficient mapping of CPU-oriented TLP applications to spatial architectures on FPGAs. Unlike OpenCilk's implicit task model, which requires costly context switching in hardware, Cilk-1 adopts explicit continuation-passing - a model that better aligns with the streaming nature of FPGAs. Bombyx supports multiple compilation targets: one is an OpenCilk-compatible runtime for executing Cilk-1-style code using the OpenCilk backend, and another is a synthesizable PE generator designed for HLS tools like Vitis HLS. Additionally, we introduce a decoupled access-execute optimization that enables automatic generation of high-performance PEs, improving memory-compute overlap and overall throughput.

Abstract: Neuromorphic accelerators offer promising platforms for machine learning (ML) inference by leveraging event-driven, spatially-expanded architectures that naturally exploit unstructured sparsity through co-located memory and compute. However, their unique architectural characteristics create performance dynamics that differ fundamentally from conventional accelerators. Existing workload optimization approaches for neuromorphic accelerators rely on aggregate network-wide sparsity and operation counting, but the extent to which these metrics actually improve deployed performance remains unknown. This paper presents the first comprehensive performance bound and bottleneck analysis of neuromorphic accelerators, revealing the shortcomings of the conventional metrics and offering an understanding of what facets matter for workload performance. We present both theoretical analytical modeling and extensive empirical characterization of three real neuromorphic accelerators: Brainchip AKD1000, Synsense Speck, and Intel Loihi 2. From these, we establish three distinct accelerator bottleneck states, memory-bound, compute-bound, and traffic-bound, and identify which workload configuration features are likely to exhibit these bottleneck states. We synthesize all of our insights into the floorline performance model, a visual model that identifies performance bounds and informs how to optimize a given workload, based on its position on the model. Finally, we present an optimization methodology that combines sparsity-aware training with floorline-informed partitioning. Our methodology achieves substantial performance improvements at iso-accuracy: up to 3.86x runtime improvement and 3.38x energy reduction compared to prior manually-tuned configurations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习存在测量瓶颈问题——狭窄的量子到经典读出限制了性能并放大了隐私风险。

Method: 采用轻量级残差混合架构，在分类前将量子特征与原始输入进行连接，避免增加量子复杂度。

Result: 模型在中心化和联邦设置中均优于纯量子模型和先前混合模型，准确率比量子基线提高高达+55%，同时保持低通信成本和增强的隐私鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为在隐私敏感、资源受限的环境（如联邦边缘学习）中集成量子模型提供了一条实用的近期路径。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) promises compact and expressive representations, but suffers from the measurement bottleneck - a narrow quantum-to-classical readout that limits performance and amplifies privacy risk. We propose a lightweight residual hybrid architecture that concatenates quantum features with raw inputs before classification, bypassing the bottleneck without increasing quantum complexity. Experiments show our model outperforms pure quantum and prior hybrid models in both centralized and federated settings. It achieves up to +55% accuracy improvement over quantum baselines, while retaining low communication cost and enhanced privacy robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the residual connection at the quantum-classical interface. Our method offers a practical, near-term pathway for integrating quantum models into privacy-sensitive, resource-constrained settings like federated edge learning.

TL;DR: MAD-DAG是首个在不利条件下对抗自私挖矿的实用协议，通过新颖的账本函数丢弃竞争最长链的等长链内容，相比Colordag和比特币能承受更恶劣的条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的自私挖矿抵抗协议Colordag未处理网络传播优势、MEV奖励变化和贿赂矿工等不利条件，且仅在延迟不切实际高时才安全。

Method: 提出MAD-DAG协议，使用新型账本函数丢弃等长竞争链的内容；通过马尔可夫决策过程建模理性矿工行为，开发保守奖励规则获得自私挖矿收益上界。

Result: MAD-DAG在存在贿赂矿工和高块奖励变化时安全阈值范围为11%-31%，而Colordag和比特币在所有级别下均为0%。

Conclusion: MAD-DAG是首个在不利条件下实用的自私挖矿抵抗协议，相比现有方案显著提升了安全性。

Abstract: Blockchain security is threatened by selfish mining, where a miner (operator) deviates from the protocol to increase their revenue. Selfish mining is exacerbated by adverse conditions: rushing (network propagation advantage for the selfish miner), varying block rewards due to block contents, called miner extractable value (MEV), and petty-compliant miners who accept bribes from the selfish miner.
  The state-of-the-art selfish-mining-resistant blockchain protocol, Colordag, does not treat these adverse conditions and was proven secure only when its latency is impractically high.
  We present MAD-DAG, Mutually-Assured-Destruction Directed-Acyclic-Graph, the first practical protocol to counter selfish mining under adverse conditions. MAD-DAG achieves this thanks to its novel ledger function, which discards the contents of equal-length chains competing to be the longest.
  We analyze selfish mining in both Colordag and MAD-DAG by modeling a rational miner using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We obtain a tractable model for both by developing conservative reward rules that favor the selfish miner to yield an upper bound on selfish mining revenue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tractable model of selfish mining in a practical DAG-based blockchain. This enables us to obtain a lower bound on the security threshold, the minimum fraction of computational power a miner needs in order to profit from selfish mining.
  MAD-DAG withstands adverse conditions under which Colordag and Bitcoin fail, while otherwise maintaining comparable security. For example, with petty-compliant miners and high levels of block reward variability, MAD-DAG's security threshold ranges from 11% to 31%, whereas both Colordag and Bitcoin achieve 0% for all levels.

Motivation: 解释Zipf定律的起源，该定律在语言中普遍存在但缺乏明确解释，现有理论存在跨学科争议

Method: 使用全组合词模型(FCWM)，从有限字母表生成单词，产生几何分布的词长，通过指数力相互作用形成幂律秩频曲线

Result: 模拟结果支持理论预测，与英语、俄语和混合体裁数据匹配良好，表明Zipf型定律可由几何约束产生

Conclusion: Zipf型定律可能源于几何约束而非交流效率，符号模型为语言普遍规律提供了非语言学的解释

Abstract: Zipf's law in language lacks a definitive origin, debated across fields. This study explains Zipf-like behavior using geometric mechanisms without linguistic elements. The Full Combinatorial Word Model (FCWM) forms words from a finite alphabet, generating a geometric distribution of word lengths. Interacting exponential forces yield a power-law rank-frequency curve, determined by alphabet size and blank symbol probability. Simulations support predictions, matching English, Russian, and mixed-genre data. The symbolic model suggests Zipf-type laws arise from geometric constraints, not communicative efficiency.

Abstract: The interference of fluorescence signals and noise remains a significant challenge in Raman spectrum analysis, often obscuring subtle spectral features that are critical for accurate analysis. Inspired by variational methods similar to those used in image denoising, our approach minimizes a functional involving fractional derivatives to balance noise suppression with the preservation of essential chemical features of the signal, such as peak position, intensity, and area. The original problem is reformulated in the frequency domain through the Fourier transform, making the implementation simple and fast. In this work, we discuss the theoretical framework, practical implementation, and the advantages and limitations of this method in the context of {simulated} Raman data, as well as in image processing. The main contribution of this article is the combination of a variational approach in the frequency domain, the use of fractional derivatives, and the optimization of the {regularization parameter and} derivative order through the concept of Shannon entropy. This work explores how the fractional order, combined with the regularization parameter, affects noise removal and preserves the essential features of the spectrum {and image}. Finally, the study shows that the combination of the proposed strategies produces an efficient, robust, and easily implementable filter.

Conclusion: MTI-Net是一个有效的端到端多任务学习框架，能够同时处理肝脏肿瘤的多个关键临床任务，通过任务间协同机制显著提升了整体性能。

Abstract: Liver tumor segmentation, dynamic enhancement regression, and classification are critical for clinical assessment and diagnosis. However, no prior work has attempted to achieve these tasks simultaneously in an end-to-end framework, primarily due to the lack of an effective framework that captures inter-task relevance for mutual improvement and the absence of a mechanism to extract dynamic MRI information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Task Interaction adversarial learning Network (MTI-Net), a novel integrated framework designed to tackle these tasks simultaneously. MTI-Net incorporates Multi-domain Information Entropy Fusion (MdIEF), which utilizes entropy-aware, high-frequency spectral information to effectively integrate features from both frequency and spectral domains, enhancing the extraction and utilization of dynamic MRI data. The network also introduces a task interaction module that establishes higher-order consistency between segmentation and regression, thus fostering inter-task synergy and improving overall performance. Additionally, we designed a novel task-driven discriminator (TDD) to capture internal high-order relationships between tasks. For dynamic MRI information extraction, we employ a shallow Transformer network to perform positional encoding, which captures the relationships within dynamic MRI sequences. In experiments on a dataset of 238 subjects, MTI-Net demonstrates high performance across multiple tasks, indicating its strong potential for assisting in the clinical assessment of liver tumors.

TL;DR: 提出深度参数插值（DPI）方法，通过动态插值两个可学习参数集来为神经网络添加标量输入依赖，适用于扩散模型和流匹配模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度生成模型需要处理高维向量和标量两种输入，传统方法要么将标量编码为额外图像输入，要么在特定网络组件中结合信息，限制了架构选择。

Method: 在单个网络中维护两个可学习参数集，根据标量值在训练和采样期间动态插值参数集，实现标量依赖。

Conclusion: 深度参数插值是一种简单、架构无关的为神经网络添加标量依赖的方法，在生成模型中表现优异。

Abstract: We propose deep parameter interpolation (DPI), a general-purpose method for transforming an existing deep neural network architecture into one that accepts an additional scalar input. Recent deep generative models, including diffusion models and flow matching, employ a single neural network to learn a time- or noise level-dependent vector field. Designing a network architecture to accurately represent this vector field is challenging because the network must integrate information from two different sources: a high-dimensional vector (usually an image) and a scalar. Common approaches either encode the scalar as an additional image input or combine scalar and vector information in specific network components, which restricts architecture choices. Instead, we propose to maintain two learnable parameter sets within a single network and to introduce the scalar dependency by dynamically interpolating between the parameter sets based on the scalar value during training and sampling. DPI is a simple, architecture-agnostic method for adding scalar dependence to a neural network. We demonstrate that our method improves denoising performance and enhances sample quality for both diffusion and flow matching models, while achieving computational efficiency comparable to standard scalar conditioning techniques. Code is available at https://github.com/wustl-cig/parameter_interpolation.

Motivation: 现有单轮安全测试无法评估真实场景中出现的纵向风险，需要开发能评估长期交互中实际危害的部署就绪性评估工具。

Method: 创建包含17个场景的基准，评估四个前沿模型在三个复杂度层级上的表现，涵盖五个评估维度和自动失败条件（危机遗漏、医疗建议、有害信息、依恋工程）。

Result: 所有模型在危机检测方面表现不佳（11.8-44.8%），DeepSeek Chat v3总体得分最高（75.9%），不同模型在不同维度各有所长：GPT-4o Mini合规性最佳（88.2%），Gemini创伤知情设计最佳（85.0%），Claude Sonnet 4.5危机检测最佳（44.8%）。

Conclusion: 当前AI模型在照护关系场景中存在显著安全漏洞，需要在生产系统中实施确定性危机路由机制，单轮安全测试不足以评估真实风险。

Abstract: InvisibleBench is a deployment gate for caregiving-relationship AI, evaluating 3-20+ turn interactions across five dimensions: Safety, Compliance, Trauma-Informed Design, Belonging/Cultural Fitness, and Memory. The benchmark includes autofail conditions for missed crises, medical advice (WOPR Act), harmful information, and attachment engineering. We evaluate four frontier models across 17 scenarios (N=68) spanning three complexity tiers. All models show significant safety gaps (11.8-44.8 percent crisis detection), indicating the necessity of deterministic crisis routing in production systems. DeepSeek Chat v3 achieves the highest overall score (75.9 percent), while strengths differ by dimension: GPT-4o Mini leads Compliance (88.2 percent), Gemini leads Trauma-Informed Design (85.0 percent), and Claude Sonnet 4.5 ranks highest in crisis detection (44.8 percent). We release all scenarios, judge prompts, and scoring configurations with code. InvisibleBench extends single-turn safety tests by evaluating longitudinal risk, where real harms emerge. No clinical claims; this is a deployment-readiness evaluation.

Motivation: 评估LLMs协助非法活动的风险，定义共犯协助行为并评估其在广泛部署模型中的普遍性。

Method: 使用真实法律案例和既定法律框架构建评估基准，涵盖269个非法场景和50种非法意图，通过四个实证研究评估LLMs的共犯协助行为。

Result: LLMs普遍易受共犯协助影响，GPT-4o在近半数案例中提供非法协助；模型在法律警告和积极引导方面表现不足；存在跨社会法律背景的安全差异，对弱势群体存在歧视性协助模式。

Conclusion: 现有安全对齐策略不足以防止LLMs的共犯协助行为，需要更有效的安全措施来应对这一高风险问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now deployed at unprecedented scale, assisting millions of users in daily tasks. However, the risk of these models assisting unlawful activities remains underexplored. In this study, we define this high-risk behavior as complicit facilitation - the provision of guidance or support that enables illicit user instructions - and present four empirical studies that assess its prevalence in widely deployed LLMs. Using real-world legal cases and established legal frameworks, we construct an evaluation benchmark spanning 269 illicit scenarios and 50 illicit intents to assess LLMs' complicit facilitation behavior. Our findings reveal widespread LLM susceptibility to complicit facilitation, with GPT-4o providing illicit assistance in nearly half of tested cases. Moreover, LLMs exhibit deficient performance in delivering credible legal warnings and positive guidance. Further analysis uncovers substantial safety variation across socio-legal contexts. On the legal side, we observe heightened complicity for crimes against societal interests, non-extreme but frequently occurring violations, and malicious intents driven by subjective motives or deceptive justifications. On the social side, we identify demographic disparities that reveal concerning complicit patterns towards marginalized and disadvantaged groups, with older adults, racial minorities, and individuals in lower-prestige occupations disproportionately more likely to receive unlawful guidance. Analysis of model reasoning traces suggests that model-perceived stereotypes, characterized along warmth and competence, are associated with the model's complicit behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that existing safety alignment strategies are insufficient and may even exacerbate complicit behavior.

Conclusion: PA-EWC通过提示感知的参数保护策略有效解决了医学AI系统的持续学习挑战，在保持已有诊断能力的同时适应新的临床需求

Abstract: Medical AI systems face catastrophic forgetting when deployed in clinical settings, where models must learn new imaging protocols while retaining prior diagnostic capabilities. This challenge is particularly acute for medical vision-language models that must preserve complex cross-modal alignments between medical images and clinical terminology across diverse imaging modalities. We introduce Prompt- Aware Adaptive Elastic Weight Consolidation (PA-EWC), a novel continual learning approach that addresses catastrophic forgetting through prompt-guided parameter specialization. Our method systematically categorizes model parameters based on their functional roles in processing visual-descriptive, spatial-guided, and medical-semantic information, enabling targeted protection of critical knowledge while allowing adaptation to new clinical requirements. PA-EWC incorporates adaptive Fisher Information computation with gradient stability analysis and develops weighted complexity metrics based on medical terminology density. We evaluate our approach across five medical imaging datasets (Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2018, CheXlocalize, BUSI, CAMUS) representing diverse modalities including endoscopy, dermoscopy, radiography, and ultrasound. Experimental results demonstrate that PA-EWC reduces catastrophic forgetting by up to 17.58% compared to baseline methods, with performance improvements of 4.30% on chest X-ray pathology localization and 6.06% on polyp segmentation.

Conclusion: AV-Edit通过多模态方法显著提升了音效编辑的灵活性和质量，为音效编辑和音频生成领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Sound effect editing-modifying audio by adding, removing, or replacing elements-remains constrained by existing approaches that rely solely on low-level signal processing or coarse text prompts, often resulting in limited flexibility and suboptimal audio quality. To address this, we propose AV-Edit, a generative sound effect editing framework that enables fine-grained editing of existing audio tracks in videos by jointly leveraging visual, audio, and text semantics. Specifically, the proposed method employs a specially designed contrastive audio-visual masking autoencoder (CAV-MAE-Edit) for multimodal pre-training, learning aligned cross-modal representations. These representations are then used to train an editorial Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) capable of removing visually irrelevant sounds and generating missing audio elements consistent with video content through a correlation-based feature gating training strategy. Furthermore, we construct a dedicated video-based sound editing dataset as an evaluation benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed AV-Edit generates high-quality audio with precise modifications based on visual content, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of sound effect editing and exhibiting strong competitiveness in the domain of audio generation.

However, their scalability is limited by the quadratic complexity of attention and the high token rates of audio signals. These challenges make it difficult to extend LALMs to long-form audio and to deploy them on resource-constrained platforms such as edge devices.
  In this paper, we explore techniques such as unsupervised segmentation, uniform average pooling, etc., to reduce the number of audio tokens generated by the LALM's audio encoder but before they are consumed by the LLM decoder. To mitigate potential performance degradation introduced by the compressed representations, we employ low-rank adapters to finetune the model. We evaluate our proposed models on two tasks, automatic speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation tasks, that are dependent on effectively uncovering the underlying lexical content of the input signal and study the effect of downsampling on these tasks. Experimental results show that compressed LALMs can achieve performance closer to frame-level LALMs while reducing the input audio token count upto three times before the LLM backbone.

TL;DR: RosettaSpeech是一个零样本语音到语音翻译框架，仅使用单语语音-文本数据和机器翻译监督进行训练，无需平行语音对，在推理时实现端到端直接语音翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平行语音语料库的稀缺严重阻碍了语音到语音翻译的发展，通常需要依赖复杂的多阶段流水线。

Method: 使用文本作为训练时的中间桥梁，利用文本NMT模型的语言知识，通过机器翻译监督增强单语语音-文本数据，推理时作为直接的端到端语音到语音模型。

Result: 在CVSS-C测试集上达到SOTA结果：德语到英语ASR-BLEU 25.17（相对提升27%），西班牙语到英语29.86（相对提升14%），单个模型可实现多对一翻译（FR/ES/DE -> EN）。

Conclusion: 通过依赖丰富的平行文本而非难以获取的平行语音，RosettaSpeech为创建高质量、保持说话人特征的语音到语音翻译提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: The scarcity of parallel speech corpora critically hampers speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), often forcing reliance on complex, multi-stage pipelines. This paper introduces RosettaSpeech, a novel and simplified framework for zero-shot S2ST that is trained on monolingual speech-text data augmented by machine translation supervision. While our method leverages the linguistic knowledge inherent in text-based NMT models, it strictly eliminates the need for parallel speech-to-speech pairs. Our model uniquely uses text as an intermediate bridge during training but functions as a direct, end-to-end speech-to-speech model at inference. This streamlined approach achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. For instance, on the CVSS-C test set, RosettaSpeech outperforms leading systems, achieving an ASR-BLEU score of 25.17 for German-to-English and 29.86 for Spanish-to-English-relative gains of over 27% and 14%, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a single model can deliver strong many-to-one translation performance (FR/ES/DE -> EN). We also provide a foundational analysis of how training data scaling impacts model performance. By prioritizing reliance on abundant parallel text rather than difficult-to-acquire parallel speech, RosettaSpeech offers a scalable path to creating high-quality, speaker-preserving S2ST for a much broader array of languages.

Motivation: 理解AI聊天机器人在开放任务中如何代表不同文化，特别是评估文化表征在印度多样化文化背景中的准确性。

Method: 通过焦点小组和个体调查开发文化误表征分类法TALES-Tax，然后进行大规模标注研究，涉及108名来自印度71个地区的标注者，共2925个标注。

Result: 88%的生成故事存在文化不准确，错误在中低资源语言和城乡结合地区更普遍。模型虽然具备必要的文化知识，但生成的故事仍充满文化误表征。

Conclusion: LLM在文化表征方面存在显著问题，特别是在资源较少的文化语境中，需要改进文化敏感性和准确性。

Abstract: Millions of users across the globe turn to AI chatbots for their creative needs, inviting widespread interest in understanding how such chatbots represent diverse cultures. At the same time, evaluating cultural representations in open-ended tasks remains challenging and underexplored. In this work, we present TALES, an evaluation of cultural misrepresentations in LLM-generated stories for diverse Indian cultural identities. First, we develop TALES-Tax, a taxonomy of cultural misrepresentations by collating insights from participants with lived experiences in India through focus groups (N=9) and individual surveys (N=15). Using TALES-Tax, we evaluate 6 models through a large-scale annotation study spanning 2,925 annotations from 108 annotators with lived cultural experience from across 71 regions in India and 14 languages. Concerningly, we find that 88\% of the generated stories contain one or more cultural inaccuracies, and such errors are more prevalent in mid- and low-resourced languages and stories based in peri-urban regions in India. Lastly, we transform the annotations into TALES-QA, a standalone question bank to evaluate the cultural knowledge of foundational models. Through this evaluation, we surprisingly discover that models often possess the requisite cultural knowledge despite generating stories rife with cultural misrepresentations.

Method: 开发了基于协作代理的半自动标注框架COALA降低标注成本；提出了HawkEyeTrack方法，协同增强视觉语言表示学习，提升无人机场景感知能力。

Result: 综合实验验证了数据集的挑战性和所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AerialMind基准填补了无人机场景参考多目标跟踪的研究空白，为智能空中系统的自然语言交互能力发展提供了重要支撑。

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to achieve precise object detection and tracking through natural language instructions, representing a fundamental capability for intelligent robotic systems. However, current RMOT research remains mostly confined to ground-level scenarios, which constrains their ability to capture broad-scale scene contexts and perform comprehensive tracking and path planning. In contrast, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) leverage their expansive aerial perspectives and superior maneuverability to enable wide-area surveillance. Moreover, UAVs have emerged as critical platforms for Embodied Intelligence, which has given rise to an unprecedented demand for intelligent aerial systems capable of natural language interaction. To this end, we introduce AerialMind, the first large-scale RMOT benchmark in UAV scenarios, which aims to bridge this research gap. To facilitate its construction, we develop an innovative semi-automated collaborative agent-based labeling assistant (COALA) framework that significantly reduces labor costs while maintaining annotation quality. Furthermore, we propose HawkEyeTrack (HETrack), a novel method that collaboratively enhances vision-language representation learning and improves the perception of UAV scenarios. Comprehensive experiments validated the challenging nature of our dataset and the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 符合社会规范的具身导航仍然是一个开放的研究挑战，需要模型既能理解社会规范又能生成符合这些规范的导航轨迹。

Method: 构建了包含700万样本的SocNav数据集，采用多阶段训练流程：首先通过模仿学习注入通用导航技能和社会规范理解，然后通过设计的SAFE-GRPO（首个基于流的强化学习框架）细化这些技能。

Result: 与最先进方法相比，SocialNav实现了+38%的成功率和+46%的社会合规率，在导航性能和社会合规性方面都表现出显著提升。

Conclusion: SocialNav通过分层架构和大规模数据集，在具身导航中实现了更好的社会规范理解和合规行为生成，为社交导航提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied navigation that adheres to social norms remains an open research challenge. Our \textbf{SocialNav} is a foundational model for socially-aware navigation with a hierarchical "brain-action" architecture, capable of understanding high-level social norms and generating low-level, socially compliant trajectories. To enable such dual capabilities, we construct the SocNav Dataset, a large-scale collection of 7 million samples, comprising (1) a Cognitive Activation Dataset providing social reasoning signals such as chain-of-thought explanations and social traversability prediction, and (2) an Expert Trajectories Pyramid aggregating diverse navigation demonstrations from internet videos, simulated environments, and real-world robots. A multi-stage training pipeline is proposed to gradually inject and refine navigation intelligence: we first inject general navigation skills and social norms understanding into the model via imitation learning, and then refine such skills through a deliberately designed Socially-Aware Flow Exploration GRPO (SAFE-GRPO), the first flow-based reinforcement learning framework for embodied navigation that explicitly rewards socially compliant behaviors. SocialNav achieves +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate compared to the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating strong gains in both navigation performance and social compliance.

TL;DR: SLUE方法通过凸优化程序为单目姿态估计提供统计严格的分布自由不确定性边界，仅需2D语义关键点的高概率噪声边界，生成保证包含真实姿态的椭球不确定性边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 姿态估计在机器人学中已有深入研究，但为其附加统计严格的不确定性边界而不依赖严格分布假设仍是一个未解决的问题，这对于鲁棒控制和规划至关重要。

Method: 开发了SLUE（S-Lemma不确定性估计）凸优化程序，将非凸的姿态不确定性约束集简化为单个椭球不确定性边界。该方法不需要对边界形状或大小的初始猜测，并扩展到平方和松弛层次以获得更紧密的不确定性边界。

Result: 在两个姿态估计数据集和真实无人机跟踪场景上的评估表明，与现有方法相比，SLUE生成明显更小的平移边界和具有竞争力的方向边界。

Conclusion: SLUE为单目姿态估计提供了统计严格、分布自由的不确定性边界，能够轻松投影到独立的平移和轴角方向边界，在保持高概率包含真实姿态的同时实现更紧凑的不确定性表征。

Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty of an object's pose estimate is essential for robust control and planning. Although pose estimation is a well-studied robotics problem, attaching statistically rigorous uncertainty is not well understood without strict distributional assumptions. We develop distribution-free pose uncertainty bounds about a given pose estimate in the monocular setting. Our pose uncertainty only requires high probability noise bounds on pixel detections of 2D semantic keypoints on a known object. This noise model induces an implicit, non-convex set of pose uncertainty constraints. Our key contribution is SLUE (S-Lemma Uncertainty Estimation), a convex program to reduce this set to a single ellipsoidal uncertainty bound that is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. SLUE solves a relaxation of the minimum volume bounding ellipsoid problem inspired by the celebrated S-lemma. It requires no initial guess of the bound's shape or size and is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. For tighter uncertainty bounds at the same confidence, we extend SLUE to a sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy which is guaranteed to converge to the minimum volume ellipsoidal uncertainty bound for a given set of keypoint constraints. We show this pose uncertainty bound can easily be projected to independent translation and axis-angle orientation bounds. We evaluate SLUE on two pose estimation datasets and a real-world drone tracking scenario. Compared to prior work, SLUE generates substantially smaller translation bounds and competitive orientation bounds. We release code at https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/PoseUncertaintySets.

TL;DR: TraceGen是一个世界模型，通过3D轨迹空间表示学习跨具身、跨环境和跨任务的视频，仅需少量演示就能高效适应新机器人任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人学习新任务时数据稀缺的问题，利用丰富的不同具身（人类和其他机器人）视频资源，克服具身差异、相机差异和环境差异带来的挑战。

Method: 提出统一的符号表示——3D轨迹空间，开发TraceGen模型预测轨迹空间中的未来运动，并构建TraceForge数据管道将异构视频转换为一致的3D轨迹数据。

Result: 在123K视频和180万观察-轨迹-语言三元组上预训练，仅需5个目标机器人视频即可在4个任务上达到80%成功率，推理速度比现有视频世界模型快50-600倍。

Conclusion: TraceGen展示了从少量演示中高效学习机器人任务的能力，特别是在跨具身适应方面表现出色，无需依赖物体检测器或繁重的像素空间生成。

Abstract: Learning new robot tasks on new platforms and in new scenes from only a handful of demonstrations remains challenging. While videos of other embodiments - humans and different robots - are abundant, differences in embodiment, camera, and environment hinder their direct use. We address the small-data problem by introducing a unifying, symbolic representation - a compact 3D "trace-space" of scene-level trajectories - that enables learning from cross-embodiment, cross-environment, and cross-task videos. We present TraceGen, a world model that predicts future motion in trace-space rather than pixel space, abstracting away appearance while retaining the geometric structure needed for manipulation. To train TraceGen at scale, we develop TraceForge, a data pipeline that transforms heterogeneous human and robot videos into consistent 3D traces, yielding a corpus of 123K videos and 1.8M observation-trace-language triplets. Pretraining on this corpus produces a transferable 3D motion prior that adapts efficiently: with just five target robot videos, TraceGen attains 80% success across four tasks while offering 50-600x faster inference than state-of-the-art video-based world models. In the more challenging case where only five uncalibrated human demonstration videos captured on a handheld phone are available, it still reaches 67.5% success on a real robot, highlighting TraceGen's ability to adapt across embodiments without relying on object detectors or heavy pixel-space generation.

Motivation: 探索现代视觉语言模型是否表现出具身认知的迹象，尽管它们主要是在非具身方式下训练的。

Method: 将具身认知评估构建为部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程，使用来自机器人仿真的可扩展流水线生成问答对，包含前向世界建模（根据动作重新排序观察）和逆向世界建模（根据观察重新排序动作）两个任务。

Result: 实验显示前沿视觉语言模型与人类之间存在性能差距，且差距随交互时间跨度增大而扩大。模型在逆向任务上表现更好，并表现出人类中心偏见，如偏好右手动作，当相机参数或视角偏离人类视觉时性能下降。

Conclusion: 现代视觉语言模型确实表现出一些具身认知的特征，但与人类相比仍有明显差距，特别是在长时程交互和视角适应方面。

Abstract: Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prune4Web是一种新的网页自动化范式，通过将DOM处理从资源密集的LLM读取转向高效的程序化修剪，实现25-50倍的候选元素减少，显著提升动作定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM网页代理在处理复杂网页时面临DOM结构过大（1万-10万token）的挑战，现有方法要么依赖粗略的DOM截断（可能丢失关键信息），要么使用低效启发式方法，无法在精度和可扩展性之间取得平衡。

Method: 提出DOM树修剪编程方法，让LLM生成可执行的Python评分脚本来动态筛选DOM元素，基于分解子任务的语义线索。该方法将遍历和评分委托给轻量级可解释程序，避免LLM直接处理原始大型DOM。

Result: 在低级定位任务上，准确率从46.8%大幅提升至88.28%，实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: Prune4Web通过程序化修剪范式有效解决了网页自动化中的DOM规模挑战，在保持精度的同时显著提升了处理效率。

Abstract: Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.

Conclusion: 该框架首次实现了保证最优的组合解释计算，揭示了现有方法的次优性问题，并提供了更高效灵活的替代方案。

Abstract: While neurons are the basic units of deep neural networks, it is still unclear what they learn and if their knowledge is aligned with that of humans. Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.

Conclusion: 该框架通过主动推理和自我进化机制有效提升了开放词汇目标检测性能，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to enable detectors to generalize across categories by leveraging semantic information. Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized machine learning on text-attributed graphs, but the application of LLMs to graph outlier detection, particularly in the context of fake news detection, remains significantly underexplored. One of the key challenges is the scarcity of large-scale, realistic, and well-annotated datasets that can serve as reliable benchmarks for outlier detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce TAGFN, a large-scale, real-world text-attributed graph dataset for outlier detection, specifically fake news detection. TAGFN enables rigorous evaluation of both traditional and LLM-based graph outlier detection methods. Furthermore, it facilitates the development of misinformation detection capabilities in LLMs through fine-tuning. We anticipate that TAGFN will be a valuable resource for the community, fostering progress in robust graph-based outlier detection and trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Hirschsprung Disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus. Therefore, their correct identification is crucial for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. We introduce a three-stage segmentation framework based on a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) that mimics the pathologist's diagnostic approach. The framework sequentially segments the muscularis propria, delineates the myenteric plexus, and identifies ganglion cells within anatomically valid regions. 30 whole-slide images of colon tissue were used, each containing expert manual annotations of muscularis, plexus, and ganglion cells at varying levels of certainty. A 5-fold cross-validation scheme was applied to each stage, along with resolution-specific tiling strategies and tailored postprocessing to ensure anatomical consistency. The proposed method achieved a Dice coefficient of 89.9% and a Plexus Inclusion Rate of 100% for muscularis segmentation. Plexus segmentation reached a recall of 94.8%, a precision of 84.2% and a Ganglia Inclusion Rate of 99.7%. For high-certainty ganglion cells, the model achieved 62.1% precision and 89.1% recall, while joint certainty scores yielded 67.0% precision. These results indicate that ViT-based models are effective at leveraging global tissue context and capturing cellular morphology at small scales, even within complex histological tissue structures. This multi-stage methodology has great potential to support digital pathology workflows by reducing inter-observer variability and assisting in the evaluation of Hirschsprung disease. The clinical impact will be evaluated in future work with larger multi-center datasets and additional expert annotations.

*Yicheng Zhong,Peiji Yang,Zhisheng Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了多奖励组相对策略优化(GRPO)框架，通过强化学习直接优化单码本TTS大语言模型的token生成策略，解决了韵律不稳定、说话人漂移和自然度下降等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单码本TTS LLMs虽然结构紧凑且可流式处理，但存在韵律不稳定、说话人漂移和自然度下降的问题，需要改进其token生成策略。

Method: 采用多奖励GRPO框架，整合了可懂度和说话人相似度目标，以及三个基于规则的奖励：时长一致性的长度惩罚、解码稳定性的熵正则化奖励、以及LLM标注的韵律对齐奖励。韵律奖励使用外部推理LLM通过上下文学习预测多个可能的停顿结构。

Result: 方法在韵律稳定性、说话人相似度和整体语音自然度方面均取得一致提升，在GRPO优化的AR骨干上附加流匹配解码器还能获得额外增益。

Conclusion: 所提出的强化学习优化方法能有效提升单码本TTS LLMs的内在AR策略，在不同数据规模和模型尺度下均表现出良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, inspiring autoregressive frameworks that represent speech as sequences of discrete codec tokens. Among them, single-codebook TTS LLMs have emerged as compact and streamable architectures that jointly model semantic and acoustic integration. However, despite their efficiency, these models often exhibit unstable prosody, speaker drift, and degraded naturalness. To address these issues, we propose a multi-reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework that directly optimizes the token generation policy of single-codebook TTS LLMs. Beyond standard intelligibility and speaker similarity objectives, our design integrates three rule-based rewards: a length penalty for duration consistency, an entropy regularization reward for decoding stability, and an LLM-annotated prosody alignment reward that explicitly supervises rhythm. In this prosody reward, an external reasoning LLM predicts multiple plausible pause structures via in-context learning, providing a human-preference-aligned supervisory signal for GRPO training. To assess universality, we further attach a flow-matching (FM) decoder on top of the GRPO-optimized AR backbone and observe consistent additional gains, indicating that our reinforcement optimization enhances the intrinsic AR policy. We further conduct a scalability analysis across data sizes and model scales, revealing that the proposed method consistently enhances prosodic stability, speaker similarity, and overall speech naturalness in single-codebook TTS LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了脉冲神经网络(SNNs)中的梯度泄漏问题，发现与传统人工神经网络(ANNs)相比，SNNs的梯度重建效果显著更差，表明SNNs具有固有的隐私保护潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习(FL)中的梯度反转攻击是严重隐私威胁，但SNNs中的这种漏洞尚未被充分研究。作者假设SNNs的非可微分性和替代梯度训练可能降低梯度信息量，从而提供更好的隐私保护。

Method: 将不同的梯度泄漏攻击方法适配到脉冲域，在多种数据领域进行综合实证研究，比较SNNs和ANNs的梯度重建效果。

Result: 实验结果显示：ANN梯度能可靠暴露输入内容，而SNN梯度只能产生噪声大、时间不一致的重建结果，无法恢复有意义的空间或时间结构。

Conclusion: 事件驱动动态和替代梯度训练的结合显著降低了梯度信息量，突显了神经形态计算固有的隐私保护潜力。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as prominent candidates for embedded and edge AI. Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.

TL;DR: DSD是一个分布式推测解码框架，通过在多设备部署中协调草稿-目标执行来加速LLM推理，解决了现有推测解码技术局限于单节点执行的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型推理存在高解码延迟和在异构边缘-云环境中可扩展性有限的问题，现有推测解码技术虽然能加速令牌生成但仍局限于单节点执行。

Method: 提出DSD分布式推测解码框架，通过协调草稿-目标执行扩展到多设备部署；引入DSD-Sim离散事件模拟器捕获网络、批处理和调度动态；设计自适应窗口控制策略动态调整推测窗口大小。

Result: 在多样化工作负载实验中，DSD相比现有推测解码基线实现了最高1.1倍的加速和9.7%的吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: DSD能够在边缘和云环境中实现敏捷且可扩展的LLM服务。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference often suffers from high decoding latency and limited scalability across heterogeneous edge-cloud environments. Existing speculative decoding (SD) techniques accelerate token generation but remain confined to single-node execution. We propose DSD, a distributed speculative decoding framework that extends SD to multi-device deployments through coordinated draft-target execution. Given the lack of prior work on simulating this paradigm, we first introduce DSD-Sim, a discrete-event simulator that captures network, batching, and scheduling dynamics. Building on insights from DSD-Sim, we further design an Adaptive Window Control (AWC) policy that dynamically adjusts speculation window size to optimize throughput. Experiments across diverse workloads show that DSD achieves up to 1.1x speedup and 9.7% higher throughput over existing SD baselines, enabling agile and scalable LLM serving across edge and cloud.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ST-PPO和S-PPO两种稳定技术来解决多轮对话中PPO训练不稳定的问题，包括轮级重要性采样和裁剪偏差校正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO在多轮对话和推理任务中训练大型语言模型时性能不稳定且容易崩溃，主要源于两个问题：令牌级重要性采样与多轮环境结构不匹配，以及离策略样本导致的优势估计不准确。

Method: 引入两种互补的稳定技术：1）轮级重要性采样，使优化与多轮推理的自然结构对齐；2）裁剪偏差校正，通过降低不可靠的离策略样本权重来归一化梯度。组合得到三个变体：Turn-PPO、S-PPO和ST-PPO。

Result: 在多轮搜索任务上的实验表明，ST-PPO和S-PPO能防止大模型训练中的性能崩溃，保持较低的裁剪比率，并获得比标准令牌级PPO更高的任务性能。

Conclusion: 轮级重要性采样与裁剪偏差校正相结合，为稳定多轮LLM智能体训练提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: PPO has been widely adopted for training large language models (LLMs) at the token level in multi-turn dialogue and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.

*Liangzu Peng,Aditya Chattopadhyay,Luca Zancato,Elvis Nunez,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gated KalmaNet (GKA) 是一种高效的线性状态空间模型层，通过在线岭回归解决SSM在召回任务中的性能差距，保持恒定内存和线性计算成本，在长短上下文任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性状态空间模型(SSM)虽然计算高效，但只能维护有损的、衰减的过去信息摘要，在召回导向任务中性能较差。需要一种既能利用完整历史信息又保持SSM效率的方法。

Method: 1. 基于卡尔曼滤波思想在线求解岭回归问题；2. 采用自适应正则化和输入相关门控控制条件数；3. 使用切比雪夫迭代替代传统迭代求解器提高数值稳定性；4. 开发硬件感知的分块实现和自定义反向传播内核。

Result: 在短上下文任务中超越现有SSM层(Mamba2、GLA、Gated DeltaNet)；在128k token的长上下文RAG和LongQA任务中，相比其他衰减记忆基线获得超过10%的相对改进。

Conclusion: GKA成功弥合了SSM在召回任务中的性能差距，通过数值稳定的在线岭回归实现了高效的长序列处理能力，在长短上下文任务中都表现出色。

Abstract: As efficient alternatives to softmax Attention, linear state-space models (SSMs) achieve constant memory and linear compute, but maintain only a lossy, fading summary of the past, often leading to inferior performance in recall oriented tasks. We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that reduces this gap by accounting for the full past when predicting the next token, while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet). On long-context, GKA excels at real-world RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens, achieving more than $10$% relative improvement over other fading memory baselines.

Abstract: Offline data selection and online self-refining generation, which enhance the data quality, are crucial steps in adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks. We tackle offline data selection and online self-refining generations through an optimization perspective. Specifically, bilevel data selection is used for offline data selection with respect to the validation dataset, and we treat online self-refining generation as a model adaptation step of selecting the model trained on current responses that best fits the validation data. Our framework offers a unified understanding of offline data selection and self-refining generation by assigning a learned data weight to each question and response, either explicitly or implicitly. For the first time, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the bilevel data selection framework and demonstrate its performance gains over unfiltered direct mixing baselines. By combining offline data with validation-weighted online generations, our method enhances fine-tuning performance. Experiments on quality enhancement and safety-aware LLM fine-tuning validate its effectiveness.

Result: 该框架能够校正LLM评估中的偏差，构建反映测试和校准数据集不确定性的置信区间，实现实用且统计可靠的LLM评估。

Conclusion: 提出的方法解决了LLM评估中的偏差和不确定性问题，为LLM作为评估器的实际应用提供了统计上可靠的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in lieu of humans. While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation. Additionally, to reduce uncertainty in the accuracy estimate, we introduce an adaptive algorithm that efficiently allocates calibration sample sizes.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has emerged as a critical tool for extracting fine-grained sentiment insights from user-generated content, particularly in e-commerce and social media domains. However, research on Bangla ABSA remains significantly underexplored due to the absence of comprehensive datasets and specialized frameworks for triplet extraction in this language. This paper introduces BanglaASTE, a novel framework for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) that simultaneously identifies aspect terms, opinion expressions, and sentiment polarities from Bangla product reviews. Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves superior performance with 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics. The framework effectively addresses key challenges in Bangla text processing including informal expressions, spelling variations, and data sparsity. This research advances the state-of-the-art in low-resource language sentiment analysis and provides a scalable solution for Bangla e-commerce analytics applications.

Conclusion: 这些架构为效率建立了灵活框架，为更高效的模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: The rigid, uniform allocation of computation in standard Transformer (TF) architectures can limit their efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale models and long sequences. Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.

Abstract: Globally interpretable models are a promising approach for trustworthy AI in safety-critical domains. Alongside global explanations, detailed local explanations are a crucial complement to effectively support human experts during inference. This work proposes the Calibrated Hierarchical QPM (CHiQPM) which offers uniquely comprehensive global and local interpretability, paving the way for human-AI complementarity. CHiQPM achieves superior global interpretability by contrastively explaining the majority of classes and offers novel hierarchical explanations that are more similar to how humans reason and can be traversed to offer a built-in interpretable Conformal prediction (CP) method. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CHiQPM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as a point predictor, maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models. This demonstrates a substantial improvement, where interpretability is incorporated without sacrificing overall accuracy. Furthermore, its calibrated set prediction is competitively efficient to other CP methods, while providing interpretable predictions of coherent sets along its hierarchical explanation.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of wildfires, making rapid and accurate prediction of fire spread essential for effective mitigation and response. Physics-based simulators such as FARSITE offer high-fidelity predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making, while existing deep learning models often yield overly smooth predictions that fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of wildfire propagation. This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average. Furthermore, the autoregressive framework facilitates systematic temporal forecasting of wildfire evolution. The proposed CGAN-based autoregressive framework enhances both the accuracy and physical interpretability of wildfire spread prediction, offering a promising foundation for time-sensitive response and evacuation planning.

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a core technology for future wireless communication systems, enabling the identification of modulation schemes without prior knowledge. This capability is essential for applications in cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and intelligent communication networks. We propose an AMC system based on a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, integrated with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. The proposed architecture leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex, time-varying communication signals. The system's practical ability was demonstrated by identifying over-the-air (OTA) signals from a custom-built FM transmitter alongside other modulation schemes. The system was trained on a hybrid dataset combining the RadioML2018 dataset with a custom-generated dataset, featuring samples at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 30dB. System performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The optimized model achieved 93.48% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.48% recall, and an F1 score of 93.45%. The AUC-ROC analysis confirmed the model's discriminative power, even in noisy conditions. This paper's experimental results validate the effectiveness of the hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for AMC, suggesting its potential application in adaptive spectrum management and advanced cognitive radio systems.

Motivation: 孟加拉国自然灾害频发，需要实时监测和快速响应系统，但目前缺乏针对孟加拉语的多模态灾害分析工具。

Method: 构建包含5,037条孟加拉语社交媒体帖子的新数据集，整合基于transformer的文本编码器（BanglaBERT、mBERT、XLM-RoBERTa）和CNN骨干网络（ResNet50、DenseNet169、MobileNetV2），采用早期融合策略处理文本和图像两种模态。

Result: 最佳模型准确率达到83.76%，比纯文本基线高3.84%，比纯图像基线高16.91%，所有类别的误分类都减少，对模糊样本有明显改进。

Conclusion: 填补了孟加拉语多模态灾害分析的关键空白，证明了在低资源环境下结合多种数据类型对实时灾害响应的益处。

Abstract: Natural disasters remain a major challenge for Bangladesh, so real-time monitoring and quick response systems are essential. In this study, we present BanglaMM-Disaster, an end-to-end deep learning-based multimodal framework for disaster classification in Bangla, using both textual and visual data from social media. We constructed a new dataset of 5,037 Bangla social media posts, each consisting of a caption and a corresponding image, annotated into one of nine disaster-related categories. The proposed model integrates transformer-based text encoders, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa, with CNN backbones such as ResNet50, DenseNet169, and MobileNetV2, to process the two modalities. Using early fusion, the best model achieves 83.76% accuracy. This surpasses the best text-only baseline by 3.84% and the image-only baseline by 16.91%. Our analysis also shows reduced misclassification across all classes, with noticeable improvements for ambiguous examples. This work fills a key gap in Bangla multimodal disaster analysis and demonstrates the benefits of combining multiple data types for real-time disaster response in low-resource settings.

Motivation: 解决深度Vision Transformers性能不如浅层模型的问题，挑战传统的缩放假设。

Method: 通过系统实证分析ViT-S、ViT-B和ViT-L在ImageNet上的表现，使用信息混洗指数量化信息混合模式。

Result: 发现更好的性能与[CLS]令牌的渐进边缘化相关，信息-任务权衡在ViT-L中比ViT-B晚约10层出现。

Conclusion: Transformer架构可能从精心校准的深度中获益更多，而非简单增加参数数量，信息混洗指数为未来架构设计提供了诊断工具。

Abstract: Deeper Vision Transformers often perform worse than shallower ones, which challenges common scaling assumptions. Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [CLS] token, originally designed as a global aggregation hub, in favor of distributed consensus among patch tokens. We quantify patterns of information mixing with an Information Scrambling Index, and show that in ViT-L the information-task tradeoff emerges roughly 10 layers later than in ViT-B, and that these additional layers correlate with increased information diffusion rather than improved task performance. Taken together, these results suggest that transformer architectures in this regime may benefit more from carefully calibrated depth that executes clean phase transitions than from simply increasing parameter count. The Information Scrambling Index provides a useful diagnostic for existing models and suggests a potential design target for future architectures.
