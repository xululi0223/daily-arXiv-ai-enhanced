The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely\nforgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall\nutility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often\nutilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI\nservices for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However,\ndependence on these external resources is often impractical and could\npotentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct\ntoken optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs\nthat directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for\nexternal resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of\ntokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the\nremaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model\nutility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the\nlatter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show\nthat the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\\times$ improvement in forget quality\non several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a\ncomparable level of model utility."}

This creates a fundamental tension between the growing\ncomplexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This\nsurvey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive,\nresource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into\nelastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and\nagentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing\naccuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under\ndistribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in\nalgorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge\ndeployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this\nwork establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and\nresource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to\nunderstand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting\nfurther discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent\nagents."}

Models trained with ERL, termed ESearch, achieve substantial\nimprovements on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, with the 3B model\nachieving +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, and the 7B model achieving +5.38% EM and\n+7.22% F1 over previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) results. These findings suggest\nthat erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for\nrobust multi-step reasoning in LLMs."}

This study analyzes the digital representation of the Iran-Israel\nconflict that occurred in June 2025, based on 120,000 comments posted on\nYouTube.

A mixed-methods design with triangulation was\nadopted. In the quantitative phase, natural language processing techniques and\nmachine learning models (BERT and XLM-RoBERTa) were used to classify comments\ninto ten categories.

While existing methods equip language\nagents with comprehensive tools/interfaces to fetch information from the\nrepository, they overlook the critical aspect of memory, where each instance is\ntypically handled from scratch assuming no prior repository knowledge. In\ncontrast, human developers naturally build long-term repository memory, such as\nthe functionality of key modules and associations between various bug types and\ntheir likely fix locations. In this work, we augment language agents with such\nmemory by leveraging a repository's commit history - a rich yet underutilized\nresource that chronicles the codebase's evolution. We introduce tools that\nallow the agent to retrieve from a non-parametric memory encompassing recent\nhistorical commits and linked issues, as well as functionality summaries of\nactively evolving parts of the codebase identified via commit patterns.

Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis\nallowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct\nand incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a\none-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to\ncorrect-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to\ngains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.\nImportantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of\nunsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To\nvalidate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed\nconditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to\nample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct\ntokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training\nsteps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks."}

These methods\nextract discrete behavioural units from the flow of the worm movements using\ndifferent types of tracking techniques. Nevertheless, these techniques require\na clear view of the entire worm body, which is not always achievable. For\nexample, this happens in high density worm conditions, which are particularly\ninformative to understand the influence of the social context on the single\nworm behaviour. In this paper, we illustrate and evaluate a method to extract\nbehavioural units from recordings of C. elegans movements which do not\nnecessarily require a clear view of the entire worm body. Moreover, the\nbehavioural units are defined by an unsupervised automatic pipeline which frees\nthe process from predefined assumptions that inevitably bias the behavioural\nanalysis. The behavioural units resulting from the automatic method are\ninterpreted by comparing them with hand-designed behavioural units. The\neffectiveness of the automatic method is evaluated by measuring the extent to\nwhich the movement of a simulated worm, with an agent-based model, matches the\nmovement of a natural worm. Our results indicate that spatio-temporal\nlocomotory patterns emerge even from single point worm tracking. Moreover, we\nshow that such patterns represent a fundamental aspect of the behavioural\nclassification process."}

One reason for this is the \"prior hole\" problem. A prior\nhole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low\nprobability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,\nhigh probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the\nposterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be\nflexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate\nsamples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper\nproposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are\nknown to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the\nELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency\non MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the\nnormalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.\nThe variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show\nthat such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating\noptimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit\nvariational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We\ncompare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple\nSOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior\nholes, and better sampling efficiency."}

As the segmentation network, the U-Net whose\nencoder was replaced by the EfficientNet was used.

Central to our approach is an encoder model that\ntransforms audio signals into latent facial expression sequences in real time,\nwhich are then decoded as photorealistic 3D facial avatars. Leveraging the\ngenerative capabilities of diffusion models, we capture the rich spectrum of\nfacial expressions necessary for natural communication while achieving\nreal-time performance (<15ms GPU time). Our novel architecture minimizes\nlatency through two key innovations: an online transformer that eliminates\ndependency on future inputs and a distillation pipeline that accelerates\niterative denoising into a single step. We further address critical design\nchallenges in live scenarios for processing continuous audio signals\nframe-by-frame while maintaining consistent animation quality. The versatility\nof our framework extends to multimodal applications, including semantic\nmodalities such as emotion conditions and multimodal sensors with head-mounted\neye cameras on VR headsets. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in facial animation accuracy over existing offline\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving 100 to 1000 times faster inference speed.\nWe validate our approach through live VR demonstrations and across various\nscenarios such as multilingual speeches."}
