In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in\nMLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual\ntokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the\nmodel's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones.

Current routing\nsystems often rely on a centralized external router trained on a fixed set of\nLLMs, making them inflexible and prone to poor performance since the small\nrouter can not fully understand the knowledge boundaries of different LLMs. We\nintroduce DiSRouter (Distributed Self-Router), a novel paradigm that shifts\nfrom centralized control to distributed routing. In DiSRouter, a query\ntraverses a network of LLM agents, each independently deciding whether to\nanswer or route to other agents based on its own self-awareness, its ability to\njudge its competence. This distributed design offers superior flexibility,\nscalability, and generalizability. To enable this, we propose a two-stage\nSelf-Awareness Training pipeline that enhances each LLM's self-awareness.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that DiSRouter significantly outperforms\nexisting routing methods in utility across various scenarios, effectively\ndistinguishes between easy and hard queries, and shows strong generalization to\nout-of-domain tasks. Our work validates that leveraging an LLM's intrinsic\nself-awareness is more effective than external assessment, paving the way for\nmore modular and efficient multi-agent systems."}

This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world\nconditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result\nin data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general\npublic imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open\nimbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.\nSecond, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and\nclass-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant\ndifficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced\ndatasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14\ndataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI\nsystems deployed in real-world IC production lines.

For LLMs to be effective in the real world,\nthey too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of\nthe source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales\npitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have\nthis capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled\nexperiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent\nwith rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they\nsuccessfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.\nWe then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic\nreflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems.

However, for large tool sets, the resulting tokens would exceed the\nLLM's context window limit, making it impossible to include every tool. Hence,\nan external retriever is used to provide LLMs with the most relevant tools for\na query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a\nuser query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as\nuser requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the\nissue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to\nfetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an LLM, i.e.,\ndescription of tools that the LLM feels will be potentially useful for the\nquery. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools\nwithin the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset\nand show that our method improves the performance of sparse and dense\nretrievers with and without training, thus showcasing its flexibility.

In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique\nnamed GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which\nfine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient\nmagnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,\nintuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but\nminimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3\n8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or\nmatches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained\nvia the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,\nincluding LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates\ncatastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained\nparameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other\nfine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds."}

Can Alice prove that Bob is using\nher model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from\nthe text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an\nindependence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model\nor text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it\nthrough the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are\nmore likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob\nis using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between\nBob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training\nrun. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant\ncorrelation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the\nnull hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the\nquery setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model\ngives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of\nover 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to\n12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value\non the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational\nsetting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's\ntext overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood\nof Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by\nrepeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The\nsecond approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few\nhundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many\nmore tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power."}

However, the research community's progress remains constrained\nby the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets\nbuilt from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive\n400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is\nconstructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real\nphotographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K\nfrom previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and\ndiversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure\ncomprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content\npreservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring\nand careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables\nresearch into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized\nsubsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential\nediting, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a\n56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;\nand (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction\nrewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,\nhigh-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust\nfoundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided\nimage editing models."}

To\nscale unit test creation, we develop a pipeline for generating synthetic\ndocuments with diverse and challenging layouts, known ground-truth HTML source\ncode, and extracted test cases. We show that RL training on these test cases\nresults in state-of-the-art performance on olmOCR-Bench, our English-language\nOCR benchmark, with the largest improvements in math formula conversion, table\nparsing, and multi-column layouts compared to previous versions.
