We expand on that research by\nconducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded\nrepresentational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of\nidentity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about\nsignificant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to\nencourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious\nand caste representation in the outputs against the actual population\ndistribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and\n\"stickiness\" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We\nfind that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups\nfar beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to\nencourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that\nrepresentational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased\nthan the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated\nprompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these\nbiases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be\nsufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental\nchanges in model development.

To address this issue, watermarking techniques\nhave emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages\ninto generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent\nefforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich\ninformation such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the\nfundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure\nreliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token\nsets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated\ncontent. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that\nimproves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects\npreferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a\nlarger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that\nrely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a\nclustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even\nwhen the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and\ndecoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the\nmessage into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically\ndecode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text\nand improving decoding accuracy.

Upon\nthis foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five\ntailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive\nevaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a\nsignificant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find,\ncannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process. We further\nidentify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias,\na fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks. We\nbelieve O-Bench can not only provide a vital evaluation tool for occlusion\nperception, but also inspire the development of MLLMs for better visual\nintelligence. Our benchmark will be made publicly available upon paper\npublication."}

We explore how the neural approach's\nreliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic\ncomputational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot\nbe analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of\nscaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,\nI demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly\nsensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone.

We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse.\nWe attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions\nin certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that\npreserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates\nthe style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation\nspace via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables\nindependent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing\ninterference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each\nsubspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to\nmaintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness. We validate our method on\nmultiple styles and languages. Extensive experiments and analyses show that\nStyliTruth significantly reduces stylization-induced truthfulness collapse and\noutperforms existing inference-time intervention methods in balancing style\nadherence with truthfulness."}

In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two\nstandard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using\ntwo representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed\nprobing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly\nunderestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under\nDFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further\ninvestigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting\nprimarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than\nfrom degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we\npropose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates\nstrategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned\nclassifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive\nexperiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior\nperformance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring\nsubstantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time."}

We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which\nconsists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs\nwith certain objects masked.

To address the issue of class imbalance in PD\nseverity staging, we propose a data structuring and preprocessing strategy\nbased on oversampling to enhance the representation of underrepresented\nseverity levels. The overall design enables to capture fine-grained temporal\nvariations and global dynamics in gait signal, significantly improving\nclassification performance for PD severity evaluation. Through extensive\nexperimentation, InceptoFormer achieves an accuracy of 96.6%, outperforming\nexisting state-of-the-art methods in PD severity assessment.

As online videos are\nstreaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient\nto store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to\nstore recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating\nwhether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target\nevent. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain\nlong-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG.

In this\npaper, we propose boosting vision semantic density to improve alignment\neffectiveness. On one hand, we enhance visual semantics through disease-level\nvision contrastive learning, which strengthens the model's ability to\ndifferentiate between normal and abnormal samples for each anatomical\nstructure. On the other hand, we introduce an anatomical normality modeling\nmethod to model the distribution of normal samples for each anatomy, leveraging\nVQ-VAE for reconstructing normal vision embeddings in the latent space. This\nprocess amplifies abnormal signals by leveraging distribution shifts in\nabnormal samples, enhancing the model's perception and discrimination of\nabnormal attributes. The enhanced visual representation effectively captures\nthe diagnostic-relevant semantics, facilitating more efficient and accurate\nalignment with the diagnostic report. We conduct extensive experiments on two\nchest CT datasets, CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT, and an abdominal CT dataset,\nMedVL-CT69K, and comprehensively evaluate the diagnosis performance across\nmultiple tasks in the chest and abdominal CT scenarios, achieving\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot performance.

To address this,\nwe leverage spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently capture\nspike-based temporal dynamics and offer enhanced biological plausibility. We\npropose a novel Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic\ndeep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), successfully replicating the\nhierarchical spatial functional organization observed in the primate visual\ncortex from low-level sensory input to high-level abstract representations.

By combining\ntraditional blendshape animation techniques with multiple machine learning\nmodels, we present both non-real time and real time solutions which drive\ncharacter expressions in a geometrically consistent and perceptually valid way.\nFor the non-real time system, we propose a 3D emotion transfer network makes\nuse of a 2D human image to generate a stylized 3D rig parameters. For the real\ntime system, we propose a blendshape adaption network which generates the\ncharacter rig parameter motions with geometric consistency and temporally\nstability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by comparing to a\ncommercial product Faceware. Results reveal that ratings of the recognition,\nintensity, and attractiveness of expressions depicted for animated characters\nvia our systems are statistically higher than Faceware. Our results may be\nimplemented into the animation pipeline, and provide animators with a system\nfor creating the expressions they wish to use more quickly and accurately."}

However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software,\nparticularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge,\nwe propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to\nautonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software.\nSpecifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel\nsoftware environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new\nsoftware, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle\nauto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we\ndesign a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a\nCurriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.\nThe agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of\nadversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist\ntraining strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from\nspecialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA\ncapable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately\nachieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on\ntheir specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across\nfive novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a\nsignificant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a\ncompetitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS."}
