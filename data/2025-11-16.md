Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Omnilingual ASR是一个可扩展的大规模语音识别系统，能够通过少量数据样本支持未服务语言，覆盖1600多种语言，其中500多种是首次获得ASR支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高资源语言ASR发展迅速而大多数语言（7000+）缺乏支持的问题，突破传统架构限制和伦理担忧，实现语言包容性。

Method: 采用70亿参数的自监督预训练学习鲁棒语音表示，引入编码器-解码器架构实现零样本泛化，结合LLM启发的解码器，使用大规模多样化训练语料。

Result: 在自动评估中显示显著提升，尤其在低资源条件下表现优异，具有强大的泛化能力，提供从3亿到70亿参数的不同规模模型。

Conclusion: 通过开源模型和工具降低研究者和社区的门槛，促进新的参与形式，强调伦理考虑和社会影响。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has advanced in high-resource languages, but most of the world's 7,000+ languages remain unsupported, leaving thousands of long-tail languages behind. Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy. We reflect on the ethical considerations shaping this design and conclude by discussing its societal impact. In particular, we highlight how open-sourcing models and tools can lower barriers for researchers and communities, inviting new forms of participation. Open-source artifacts are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/omnilingual-asr.

### [2] [Order Matters: Rethinking Prompt Construction in In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09700)
*Warren Li,Yiqian Wang,Zihan Wang,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现示例排序对上下文学习性能的影响与示例选择相当，挑战了传统认为示例选择更重要的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视上下文学习中示例选择比排序更重要的传统假设，通过系统比较两者对性能的影响。

Method: 在分类和生成任务上进行控制实验，使用多个开源模型家族和GPT-5，比较不同示例排序和选择对性能的方差影响。

Result: 不同示例排序导致的性能方差与使用完全不同示例集相当；通过开发集可以识别强排序，性能接近基于测试标签选择的最佳排序。

Conclusion: 示例选择和排序在提示设计中具有同等且相互交织的重要性，需要重新审视上下文学习中的传统假设。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models to perform new tasks by conditioning on a sequence of examples. Most prior work reasonably and intuitively assumes that which examples are chosen has a far greater effect on performance than how those examples are ordered, leading to a focus on example selection. We revisit this assumption and conduct a systematic comparison between the effect of selection and ordering. Through controlled experiments on both classification and generation tasks, using multiple open-source model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, we find that the variance in performance due to different example orderings is comparable to that from using entirely different example sets. Furthermore, we show that strong orderings can be identified using only a development set, achieving performance close to an oracle that selects the best ordering based on test labels. Our findings highlight the equal and intertwined importance of example selection and ordering in prompt design, calling for a reexamination of the assumptions held in ICL.

### [3] [Contextual morphologically-guided tokenization for Latin encoder models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09709)
*Marisa Hudspeth,Patrick J. Burns,Brendan O'Connor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了针对拉丁语（一种形态丰富的语言）的形态感知分词方法，发现基于形态学的分词能提升下游任务性能，特别是在领域外文本上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分词方法通常优先考虑信息理论目标（如高压缩和低生育率），而不是语言学目标（如形态对齐）。对于形态丰富的语言，分词质量直接影响下游性能。

Method: 研究拉丁语的形态感知分词，利用拉丁语作为中等预训练数据资源但具有丰富词典资源的特点，开发形态引导的分词方法。

Result: 形态引导的分词在四个下游任务上提高了整体性能，特别是在领域外文本上表现最为显著，表明模型具有改进的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 对于缺乏大规模预训练数据的低资源语言，开发和整合语言资源可以作为提高语言模型性能的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical component of language model pretraining, yet standard tokenization methods often prioritize information-theoretical goals like high compression and low fertility rather than linguistic goals like morphological alignment. In fact, they have been shown to be suboptimal for morphologically rich languages, where tokenization quality directly impacts downstream performance. In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linguistic resources to improve language modeling for morphologically complex languages. For low-resource languages that lack large-scale pretraining data, the development and incorporation of linguistic resources can serve as a feasible alternative to improve LM performance.

*C. LeMay,A. Lane,J. Seales,M. Winstead,S. Baty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了NLP在从里根到克林顿政府时期的总统指令中提取主要主题的应用，发现NLP与人工分析在识别相关文档方面具有潜力，但也存在差异，需要进一步验证NLP在此类应用中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索NLP在处理大规模书面语料库中的效用，特别是在识别总统指令中的信号主题方面，以评估NLP在社会科学研究中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用自然语言处理技术从里根到克林顿政府时期的总统指令语料库中提取主要主题，并与人工分析结果进行比较。

Result: NLP和人工分析都能识别相关文档，表明NLP在大规模书面语料库研究中具有潜在效用，但两者结果存在差异，需要进一步验证。

Conclusion: 虽然NLP展示了在社会科学应用中的内在能力，但由于AI/ML技术的快速发展，现有工具可能已过时，需要更多研究来评估NLP在此类用例中的有效性。

Abstract: Our research investigates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to extract main topics from a larger corpus of written data, as applied to the case of identifying signaling themes in Presidential Directives (PDs) from the Reagan through Clinton administrations. Analysts and NLP both identified relevant documents, demonstrating the potential utility of NLPs in research involving large written corpuses. However, we also identified discrepancies between NLP and human-labeled results that indicate a need for more research to assess the validity of NLP in this use case. The research was conducted in 2023, and the rapidly evolving landscape of AIML means existing tools have improved and new tools have been developed; this research displays the inherent capabilities of a potentially dated AI tool in emerging social science applications.

### [5] [How Small Can You Go? Compact Language Models for On-Device Critical Error Detection in Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09748)
*Muskaan Chopra,Lorenz Sparrenberg,Sarthak Khanna,Rafet Sifa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现约10亿参数的小型语言模型在机器翻译关键错误检测任务中能达到最佳质量效率平衡，Gemma-3-1B模型在保持低计算成本的同时实现高检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在机器翻译评估方面表现出色，但其规模和成本限制了在边缘设备和隐私敏感工作流中的部署，因此需要探索更小模型的有效性。

Method: 使用多个小于20亿参数的模型，通过标准化提示、轻量级logit-bias校准和多数投票方法，在WMT21、WMT22和SynCED-EnDe-2025数据集上进行评估。

Result: Gemma-3-1B在质量效率权衡方面表现最佳，在SynCED-EnDe-2025上达到MCC=0.77和F1-ERR=0.98，同时在MacBook Pro M4 Pro上保持400ms单样本延迟。

Conclusion: 紧凑的指令调优语言模型结合轻量级校准和小样本监督，能够为机器翻译提供可信赖的端侧关键错误检测，实现私有、低成本的实时错误筛查。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at evaluating machine translation (MT), but their scale and cost hinder deployment on edge devices and in privacy-sensitive workflows. We ask: how small can you get while still detecting meaning-altering translation errors? Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost. In contrast, ultra-small models (0.6B) remain usable with few-shot calibration yet under-detect entity and number errors. Overall, compact, instruction-tuned LLMs augmented with lightweight calibration and small-sample supervision can deliver trustworthy, on-device CED for MT, enabling private, low-cost error screening in real-world translation pipelines. All datasets, prompts, and scripts are publicly available at our GitHub repository.

### [6] [Predicate-Argument Structure Divergences in Chinese and English Parallel Sentences and their Impact on Language Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09796)
*Rocco Tripodi,Xiaoyu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了中英文平行句子中的谓词-论元结构，发现语言迁移具有不对称性，这对跨语言NLP中的源语言选择有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言NLP在低资源场景中应用广泛，但语言间的类型学差异阻碍了知识迁移，特别是对于类型距离较远的语言如中文和英文。

Method: 通过注释投影实验，分别以中文和英文作为源语言，分析平行句子中谓词注释的对齐和不对齐情况，并进行定性和定量分析。

Result: 语言迁移具有明显的不对称性，源语言的选择对迁移效果有显著影响。

Conclusion: 在跨语言NLP应用中，源语言的选择需要谨慎考虑，任何关于跨语言NLP的科学主张都需要先进行语言迁移不对称性的调查。

Abstract: Cross-lingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained significant traction in recent years, offering practical solutions in low-resource settings by transferring linguistic knowledge from resource-rich to low-resource languages. This field leverages techniques like annotation projection and model transfer for language adaptation, supported by multilingual pre-trained language models. However, linguistic divergences hinder language transfer, especially among typologically distant languages. In this paper, we present an analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences. We explore the alignment and misalignment of predicate annotations, inspecting similarities and differences and proposing a categorization of structural divergences. The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences. The results of this analysis show clearly that language transfer is asymmetric. An aspect that requires attention when it comes to selecting the source language in transfer learning applications and that needs to be investigated before any scientific claim about cross-lingual NLP is proposed.

### [7] [TARG: Training-Free Adaptive Retrieval Gating for Efficient RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09803)
*Yufeng Wang,Lu wei,Haibin Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TARG方法，通过基于模型无上下文草稿的轻量级不确定性评分来决定何时进行检索，显著减少检索次数（70-90%）同时保持或提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法为每个查询都进行检索会降低质量、增加token消耗和延迟，需要更智能的检索触发机制。

Method: 使用基础模型生成短无上下文草稿，从草稿前缀logits计算轻量级不确定性分数（平均token熵、top-1/top-2 logit间隙的边际信号、小N方差），仅在分数超过阈值时触发检索。

Result: 在NQ-Open、TriviaQA和PopQA数据集上，TARG在保持或改进EM/F1的同时，将检索次数减少70-90%，显著降低端到端延迟。

Conclusion: TARG提供了一种无需训练、模型无关的检索门控方法，边际信号是稳健的默认选择，小N方差提供了保守的预算优先替代方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factuality but retrieving for every query often hurts quality while inflating tokens and latency. We propose Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG), a single-shot policy that decides when to retrieve using only a short, no-context draft from the base model. From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative. We provide ablations over gate type and prefix length and use a delta-latency view to make budget trade-offs explicit.

### [8] [Khmer Spellchecking: A Holistic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09812)
*Marry Kong,Rina Buoy,Sovisal Chenda,Nguonly Taing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种综合方法解决高棉语拼写检查问题，通过集成子词分割、命名实体识别、字形到音素转换和语言模型，实现了94.4%的最新准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高棉语拼写检查面临词汇表与分词模型不匹配、单词有多种书写形式、复合词灵活形成但不在词汇表中、专有名词被误判为拼写错误等挑战，现有解决方案无法充分应对这些问题。

Method: 集成高棉语子词分割、命名实体识别、字形到音素转换和语言模型，识别潜在修正候选并排序最合适的候选。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在高棉语拼写检查上达到了94.4%的最新准确率，优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的综合方法有效解决了高棉语拼写检查的多个挑战，并为该领域提供了公开的基准数据集。

Abstract: Compared to English and other high-resource languages, spellchecking for Khmer remains an unresolved problem due to several challenges. First, there are misalignments between words in the lexicon and the word segmentation model. Second, a Khmer word can be written in different forms. Third, Khmer compound words are often loosely and easily formed, and these compound words are not always found in the lexicon. Fourth, some proper nouns may be flagged as misspellings due to the absence of a Khmer named-entity recognition (NER) model. Unfortunately, existing solutions do not adequately address these challenges. This paper proposes a holistic approach to the Khmer spellchecking problem by integrating Khmer subword segmentation, Khmer NER, Khmer grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, and a Khmer language model to tackle these challenges, identify potential correction candidates, and rank the most suitable candidate. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art Khmer spellchecking accuracy of up to 94.4%, compared to existing solutions. The benchmark datasets for Khmer spellchecking and NER tasks in this study will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 开发了一个结合数据分析和机器学习的课程推荐系统，帮助学生选择与行业趋势相符的课程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决学生选择相关课程的挑战，弥合大学学习与行业期望之间的差距

Method: 使用数据挖掘和协同过滤技术分析历史课程和个人职业目标，结合机器学习算法和用户偏好构建算法框架，并通过迭代原型设计和用户反馈优化前端界面

Result: 开发了一个易于使用的课程推荐系统，能够根据行业趋势和用户偏好提供个性化课程建议

Conclusion: 该系统是促进学生终身学习和职业发展的有用工具，有助于学生做出基于数据和行业信息的课程决策，改善大学毕业生就业成果

Abstract: This paper aims to address the challenge of selecting relevant courses for students by proposing the design and development of a course recommendation system. The course recommendation system utilises a combination of data analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms to recommend courses that align with current industry trends and requirements. In order to provide customised suggestions, the study entails the design and implementation of an extensive algorithmic framework that combines machine learning methods, user preferences, and academic criteria. The system employs data mining and collaborative filtering techniques to examine past courses and individual career goals in order to provide course recommendations. Moreover, to improve the accessibility and usefulness of the recommendation system, special attention is given to the development of an easy-to-use front-end interface. The front-end design prioritises visual clarity, interaction, and simplicity through iterative prototyping and user input revisions, guaranteeing a smooth and captivating user experience. We refined and optimised the proposed system by incorporating user feedback, ensuring that it effectively meets the needs and preferences of its target users. The proposed course recommendation system could be a useful tool for students, instructors, and career advisers to use in promoting lifelong learning and professional progression as it fills the gap between university learning and industry expectations. We hope that the proposed course recommendation system will help university students in making data-drive and industry-informed course decisions, in turn, improving graduate outcomes for the university sector.

### [10] [Answering Students' Questions on Course Forums Using Multiple Chain-of-Thought Reasoning and Finetuning RAG-Enabled LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09831)
*Neo Wang,Sonit Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了基于RAG方法和大语言模型的课程论坛问答系统，以解决学生问题响应不及时和重复问题过多的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 课程论坛中学生问题数量增加导致响应不及时，教师面临大量重复问题，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用开源大语言模型，在相关课程数据集上进行微调，结合本地知识库和RAG方法检索相关文档，并集成多链思维推理减少幻觉。

Result: 在HotpotQA数据集上的实验表明，微调后的LLM结合RAG方法在问答任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: 基于RAG的微调LLM系统能有效解决课程论坛中的问答问题，提高响应效率和质量。

Abstract: The course forums are increasingly significant and play vital role in facilitating student discussions and answering their questions related to the course. It provides a platform for students to post their questions related to the content and admin issues related to the course. However, there are several challenges due to the increase in the number of students enrolled in the course. The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a question answering system based on large language model with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) method. This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset. To further improve the performance, we use a local knowledge base and applied RAG method to retrieve relevant documents relevant to students' queries, where the local knowledge base contains all the course content. To mitigate the hallucination of LLMs, We also integrate it with multi chain-of-thought reasoning to overcome the challenge of hallucination in LLMs. In this work, we experiment fine-tuned LLM with RAG method on the HotpotQA dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned LLM with RAG method has a strong performance on question answering task.

### [11] [TermGPT: Multi-Level Contrastive Fine-Tuning for Terminology Adaptation in Legal and Financial Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09854)
*Yidan Sun,Mengying Zhu,Feiyue Chen,Yangyang Wu,Xiaolei Dan,Mengyuan Yang,Xiaolin Zheng,Shenglin Ben*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TermGPT是一个多级对比微调框架，通过构建句子图和多级对比学习来解决LLMs在专业术语表示上的各向同性问题，在金融和法律领域的术语区分任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在文本生成任务中表现出色，但其嵌入空间存在各向同性问题，导致对法律和金融等专业领域的术语表示能力不足，这会严重影响下游任务如法律判决预测和金融风险分析。

Method: 首先构建句子图捕捉语义和结构关系，基于上下文和拓扑线索生成语义一致但具有区分性的正负样本；然后设计句子级和token级的多级对比学习方法，增强全局上下文理解和细粒度术语区分能力。

Result: 构建了首个基于官方监管文件的金融术语数据集，实验表明TermGPT在金融和法律领域的术语区分任务中优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: TermGPT通过多级对比学习框架有效解决了LLMs在专业术语表示上的局限性，为法律和金融等专业领域的下游任务提供了更好的基础模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in text generation tasks; however, their embedding spaces often suffer from the isotropy problem, resulting in poor discrimination of domain-specific terminology, particularly in legal and financial contexts. This weakness in terminology-level representation can severely hinder downstream tasks such as legal judgment prediction or financial risk analysis, where subtle semantic distinctions are critical. To address this problem, we propose TermGPT, a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework designed for terminology adaptation. We first construct a sentence graph to capture semantic and structural relations, and generate semantically consistent yet discriminative positive and negative samples based on contextual and topological cues. We then devise a multi-level contrastive learning approach at both the sentence and token levels, enhancing global contextual understanding and fine-grained terminology discrimination. To support robust evaluation, we construct the first financial terminology dataset derived from official regulatory documents. Experiments show that TermGPT outperforms existing baselines in term discrimination tasks within the finance and legal domains.

*Mingye Zhu,Yi Liu,Zheren Fu,Quan Wang,Yongdong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InTRO是一个新的框架，通过令牌级探索和自我反馈来解决大型语言模型在思维链推理中的泛化问题，在数学推理基准上显著提升准确率并减少冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法存在局限性：监督微调惩罚有效替代方案，而强化学习面临信用分配和计算成本问题，需要一种能处理多种有效推理路径的方法。

Method: 利用生成策略与其答案条件对应策略之间的信息差异估计校正因子，进行令牌级重要性加权，实现单次前向传播中的令牌级探索和自我反馈。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准上，InTRO相对基础模型将解决方案准确率提升高达20%，推理链更简洁，并能成功适应数学领域之外的跨领域推理任务。

Conclusion: InTRO通过令牌级优化实现了准确、简洁的推理，展示了强大的泛化能力，为思维链推理提供了有效的训练框架。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for chain-of-thought reasoning presents a significant challenge: supervised fine-tuning on a single "golden" rationale hurts generalization as it penalizes equally valid alternatives, whereas reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards struggles with credit assignment and prohibitive computational cost. To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model. Its chains of thought are also notably more concise, exhibiting reduced verbosity. Beyond this, InTRO enables cross-domain transfer, successfully adapting to out-of-domain reasoning tasks that extend beyond the realm of mathematics, demonstrating robust generalization.

*Nikunj Gupta,Bill Guo,Rajgopal Kannan,Viktor K. Prasanna*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HierRouter是一种分层路由方法，通过动态组装轻量级专业语言模型来提升LLM推理性能，在保持低成本的同时将响应质量提升达2.4倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然性能优异，但计算和内存成本高昂，限制了在资源受限或实时场景中的部署

Method: 将问题建模为有限时域马尔可夫决策过程，训练基于PPO的强化学习代理在推理过程中迭代选择要调用的模型，基于上下文和累积成本做出路由决策

Result: 在6个基准测试中，HierRouter相比独立使用单个模型将响应质量提升达2.4倍，同时仅产生最小的额外推理成本

Conclusion: 分层路由方法为实现成本高效、高性能的LLM推理提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art performance across many tasks but impose high computational and memory costs, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained or real-time settings. To address this, we propose HierRouter, a hierarchical routing approach that dynamically assembles inference pipelines from a pool of specialized, lightweight language models. Formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), our approach trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning agent to iteratively select which models to invoke at each stage of multi-hop inference. The agent conditions on the evolving context and accumulated cost to make context-aware routing decisions. Experiments with three open-source candidate LLMs across six benchmarks, including QA, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, show that HierRouter improves response quality by up to 2.4x compared to using individual models independently, while incurring only a minimal additional inference cost on average. These results highlight the promise of hierarchical routing for cost-efficient, high-performance LLM inference. All codes can be found here https://github.com/ Nikunj-Gupta/hierouter.

*Jialin Wu,Kecen Li,Zhicong Huang,Xinfeng Li,Xiaofeng Wang,Cheng Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EnchTable是一个新颖的框架，用于在微调LLMs时保持安全对齐，通过NTK-based安全向量蒸馏和干扰感知合并技术，在不影响性能的情况下提升模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调大型语言模型到专业领域时，往往会削弱模型的安全对齐，增加有害输出的风险。

Method: 使用基于神经正切核的安全向量蒸馏方法解耦安全约束与任务推理，结合干扰感知合并技术平衡安全性和实用性。

Result: 在11个数据集上的评估显示，EnchTable显著降低了不安全率，提高了效用得分，并能抵抗静态和动态越狱攻击。

Conclusion: EnchTable能够有效维持LLMs的安全对齐，具有通用性和易部署性，是解决微调安全问题的可行方案。

Abstract: Many machine learning models are fine-tuned from large language models (LLMs) to achieve high performance in specialized domains like code generation, biomedical analysis, and mathematical problem solving. However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains. Additionally, we validate EnchTable can be seamlessly integrated into various deployment pipelines without significant overhead.

Method: 构建全面的预处理和筛选流程，包括面部关键点检测、唇部区域隔离稳定、多模态样本质量定量评估；采用课程学习策略，从干净样本开始训练并逐步加入困难样本；使用SigLIP编码器和Unified 3D-Resampler高效编码高帧率唇部运动。

Result: 在专门构建的HI-Dialogue数据集上，HI-TransPA在字面准确性和语义保真度方面均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 为将Omni-Models应用于辅助通信技术奠定了基础，提供了端到端建模框架和必要的处理工具。

Abstract: To provide a unified and flexible solution for daily communication among hearing-impaired individuals, we introduce the Omni-Model paradigm into assistive technology and present HI-TransPA, an instruction-driven audio-visual personal assistant. The model fuses indistinct speech with high-frame-rate lip dynamics, enabling both translation and dialogue within a single multimodal framework. To tackle the challenges of noisy and heterogeneous raw data and the limited adaptability of existing Omni-Models to hearing-impaired speech, we construct a comprehensive preprocessing and curation pipeline that detects facial landmarks, isolates and stabilizes the lip region, and quantitatively assesses multimodal sample quality. These quality scores guide a curriculum learning strategy that first trains on clean, high-confidence samples and progressively incorporates harder cases to strengthen model robustness. We further adopt a SigLIP encoder combined with a Unified 3D-Resampler to efficiently encode high-frame-rate lip motion. Experiments on our purpose-built HI-Dialogue dataset show that HI-TransPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both literal accuracy and semantic fidelity. This work establishes a foundation for applying Omni-Models to assistive communication technology, providing an end-to-end modeling framework and essential processing tools for future research.

TL;DR: Norm-RAG是一个检索增强的智能框架，用于多轮对话中的社会规范推理，通过语义分块方法检索结构化规范文档，提升跨文化对话系统的规范检测和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会规范是主观、语境依赖且跨文化变化的，现有方法主要针对孤立话语或合成对话，难以捕捉真实对话的流动性和多轮特性。

Method: 提出Norm-RAG框架，建模话语级属性（沟通意图、说话者角色、人际框架、语言线索），通过语义分块检索结构化规范文档，实现可解释的规范推理。

Result: 实验表明Norm-RAG提高了规范检测和泛化能力，在跨文化适应性对话系统中表现更好。

Conclusion: Norm-RAG为多语言对话中的社会规范推理提供了有效框架，支持文化适应性和社会智能对话系统的发展。

Abstract: Social norms are implicit, culturally grounded expectations that guide interpersonal communication. Unlike factual commonsense, norm reasoning is subjective, context-dependent, and varies across cultures, posing challenges for computational models. Prior works provide valuable normative annotations but mostly target isolated utterances or synthetic dialogues, limiting their ability to capture the fluid, multi-turn nature of real-world conversations. In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations. Each turn is annotated for norm category and adherence status using multi-annotator consensus, reflecting cross-cultural and realistic norm expression. Our experiments show that Norm-RAG improves norm detection and generalization, demonstrates improved performance for culturally adaptive and socially intelligent dialogue systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过LLM自动生成知识组件(KCs)，并提出了基于余弦相似度的语义合并策略来解决冗余问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识组件是自适应学习系统的核心，但手动识别耗时耗力。虽然LLM提供了自动化可能，但现有方法存在数据集小、生成标签冗余的问题。

Method: 首先使用GPT-4o-mini在646个选择题数据集上扩展"模拟教科书"提示策略，然后提出基于余弦相似度的语义合并方法来减少冗余KCs。

Result: 初始LLM方法表现差于专家模型(RMSE 0.4285 vs 0.4206)，生成569个KCs(专家为101个)。使用余弦相似度阈值0.8合并后，KCs减少到428个，RMSE提升至0.4259。

Conclusion: 单独使用扩展的LLM生成不足够，但结合语义合并技术为自动化KC识别提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Knowledge Components (KCs) are foundational to adaptive learning systems, but their manual identification by domain experts is a significant bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a "simulated textbook" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.

TL;DR: REAP方法通过递归评估和自适应规划解决多跳推理任务中的全局规划不足问题，显著提升RAG在复杂推理任务中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在多跳推理任务中缺乏全局规划，容易陷入局部推理困境，且对检索内容的利用不足，忽视潜在线索，影响推理结果的准确性

Method: 提出REAP框架，包含子任务规划器(SP)和事实提取器(FE)模块。SP维护全局视角，FE进行细粒度分析提取可靠答案和线索，两模块协同工作增量构建全局知识表示

Result: 在多个公开多跳数据集上的实验表明，该方法在领域内和领域外设置下均显著优于现有RAG方法

Conclusion: REAP通过结构化子任务和事实维护，结合统一任务范式设计，有效提升了复杂多跳推理任务的可靠性和可追溯性

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been extensively employed to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues. These two modules incrementally enrich a logically coherent representation of global knowledge, enhancing the reliability and the traceability of the reasoning process. Furthermore, we propose a unified task paradigm design that enables effective multi-task fine-tuning, significantly enhancing SP's performance on complex, data-scarce tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple public multi-hop datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing RAG methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, validating its effectiveness in complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 对最先进的语言模型在数值声明验证任务上的系统评估显示，即使领先的专有系统在特定扰动下准确率下降高达62%，没有模型在所有条件下都表现稳健。增加上下文长度通常会降低准确率，但当扩展上下文包含扰动示例时，大多数模型能显著恢复。

Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识密集型任务上表现出色，但在数值推理方面存在困难，需要系统评估其在数值声明验证任务上的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用受控扰动（包括标签翻转探针）对最先进模型进行系统评估，测试其在数值声明和证据对上的真实性预测能力。

Result: 所有模型在特定扰动下都出现准确率下降，最大降幅达62%；增加上下文长度会降低准确率，但加入扰动示例的扩展上下文能帮助模型显著恢复性能。

Conclusion: 当前语言模型在数值事实核查方面存在关键局限性，鲁棒性仍然是一个开放挑战。

Abstract: Large language models show strong performance on knowledge intensive tasks such as fact-checking and question answering, yet they often struggle with numerical reasoning. We present a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models for veracity prediction on numerical claims and evidence pairs using controlled perturbations, including label-flipping probes, to test robustness. Our results indicate that even leading proprietary systems experience accuracy drops of up to 62\% under certain perturbations. No model proves to be robust across all conditions. We further find that increasing context length generally reduces accuracy, but when extended context is enriched with perturbed demonstrations, most models substantially recover. These findings highlight critical limitations in numerical fact-checking and suggest that robustness remains an open challenge for current language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态RAG方法基于低token置信度触发检索，可能导致错误传播后才干预。需要更早检测不确定性趋势来优化检索时机

Method: ETC利用熵序列的一阶和二阶差分检测不确定性趋势，实现更早更精确的检索触发，无需训练且与模型无关

Result: 在六个QA基准测试和三个LLM骨干网络上，ETC始终优于强基线方法，同时降低检索频率，在领域特定场景中表现尤为突出

Conclusion: 趋势感知的不确定性建模能产生更有效的检索时机，ETC方法即插即用、模型无关，可轻松集成到现有解码流程中

Abstract: Dynamic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows large language models (LLMs) to fetch external knowledge on demand, offering greater adaptability than static RAG. A central challenge in this setting lies in determining the optimal timing for retrieval. Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. Ablation studies and qualitative analyses further confirm that trend-aware uncertainty modeling yields more effective retrieval timing. The method is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and readily integrable into existing decoding pipelines. Implementation code is included in the supplementary materials.

Motivation: 多语言RAG在检索证据与查询语言不一致时，模型会产生语言漂移现象，特别是在推理密集型解码过程中，中间步骤会引入进一步的语言不稳定性。

Method: 提出Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD)策略，通过惩罚非目标语言标记来温和地引导生成朝向目标语言，该方法是模型无关的，无需修改架构或额外数据。

Result: 在三个多语言数据集和多种类型多样语言上的实验表明，SCD一致地改善了语言对齐和任务性能。

Conclusion: SCD为多语言RAG提供了一种有效且可推广的解决方案，能够有效缓解输出语言漂移问题。

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform knowledge-intensive tasks in multilingual settings by leveraging retrieved documents as external evidence. However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.
  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data. Experiments across three multilingual datasets and multiple typologically diverse languages show that SCD consistently improves language alignment and task performance, providing an effective and generalizable solution in multilingual RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERTScore作为语义相似度评估指标，在金融领域对数值变化不敏感，而金融文本中数值精度直接影响语义（如2%收益与20%损失的区分）

Method: 构建FinNuE诊断数据集，通过控制数值扰动覆盖财报电话会议、监管文件、社交媒体和新闻文章，测试BERTScore对数值变化的敏感性

Result: BERTScore无法区分语义关键的数值差异，经常为财务上截然不同的文本对分配高相似度分数

Conclusion: 基于嵌入的指标在金融领域存在根本局限性，需要开发数值感知的金融NLP评估框架

Abstract: BERTScore has become a widely adopted metric for evaluating semantic similarity between natural language sentences. However, we identify a critical limitation: BERTScore exhibits low sensitivity to numerical variation, a significant weakness in finance where numerical precision directly affects meaning (e.g., distinguishing a 2% gain from a 20% loss). We introduce FinNuE, a diagnostic dataset constructed with controlled numerical perturbations across earnings calls, regulatory filings, social media, and news articles. Using FinNuE, demonstrate that BERTScore fails to distinguish semantically critical numerical differences, often assigning high similarity scores to financially divergent text pairs. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations of embedding-based metrics for finance and motivate numerically-aware evaluation frameworks for financial NLP.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like content. This has revolutionized various sectors such as healthcare, software development, and education. In education, LLMs offer potential for personalized and interactive learning experiences, especially in regions with limited teaching resources. However, adapting these models effectively to curriculum-specific content, such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus in India, presents unique challenges in terms of accuracy, alignment, and pedagogical relevance. In this paper, we present the framework "PustakAI"\footnote{Pustak means `book' in many Indian languages.} for the design and evaluation of a novel question-answering dataset "NCERT-QA" aligned with the NCERT curriculum for English and Science subjects of grades 6 to 8. We classify the curated QA pairs as Factoid, Inferential, and Others (evaluative and reasoning). We evaluate the dataset with various prompting techniques, such as meta-prompt, few-shot, and CoT-style prompting, using diverse evaluation metrics to understand which approach aligns more efficiently with the structure and demands of the curriculum. Along with the usability of the dataset, we analyze the strengths and limitations of current open-source LLMs (Gemma3:1b, Llama3.2:3b, and Nemotron-mini:4b) and high-end LLMs (Llama-4-Scout-17B and Deepseek-r1-70B) as AI-based learning tools in formal education systems.

Motivation: 标准自注意力的二次复杂度限制了Transformer模型在长上下文任务中的应用，而现有高效变体通常需要架构修改和从头预训练。

Method: 将长输入分割成重叠块，使用参数自由的融合机制，通过累积前后块的上下文向量来丰富每个块的边界表示，赋予其文档结构意识。

Conclusion: ScaleFormer提供了一种简单有效的方法，使预训练模型能够有效推理长文本，实现线性复杂度并保持文档叙事流程的结构意识。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of standard self-attention severely limits the application of Transformer-based models to long-context tasks. While efficient Transformer variants exist, they often require architectural changes and costly pre-training from scratch. To circumvent this, we propose ScaleFormer(Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer) - a simple and effective plug-and-play framework that adapts off-the-shelf pre-trained encoder-decoder models to process long sequences without requiring architectural modifications. Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text. Experiments on long-document summarization show that our method is highly competitive with and often outperforms state-of-the-art approaches without requiring architectural modifications or external retrieval mechanisms.

Conclusion: 这项研究连接了人工智能和认知语言学领域，首次提供了关于MLLMs可解释性方面语音象征性的大规模定量分析。

Abstract: Sound symbolism is a linguistic concept that refers to non-arbitrary associations between phonetic forms and their meanings. We suggest that this can be a compelling probe into how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in human languages. We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes. These results bridge domains of artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics, providing the first large-scale, quantitative analyses of phonetic iconicity in terms of MLLMs' interpretability.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖大规模多轮对话数据集来微调大语言模型，将每个响应生成视为孤立任务，未能明确将多轮指令跟随纳入优化目标，导致模型在处理复杂长距离约束时表现不佳。

Method: GraphIF包含三个关键组件：基于智能体的关系提取模块（通过动作触发机制捕获轮间语义关系构建结构化图）、关系图提示生成模块（将结构化图信息转换为自然语言提示）、响应重写模块（使用生成的图提示优化初始LLM输出）。

Result: 在两个长多轮对话数据集上的广泛实验表明，GraphIF可以无缝集成到指令微调的LLMs中，并在所有四个多轮指令跟随评估指标上带来显著改进。

Conclusion: 图结构特别适合建模多轮指令跟随，GraphIF框架通过图提示有效增强了LLMs在多轮对话中的指令跟随能力。

Abstract: Multi-turn instruction following is essential for building intelligent conversational systems that can consistently adhere to instructions across dialogue turns. However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.

Abstract: We present ADI-20, an extension of the previously published ADI-17 Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) dataset. ADI-20 covers all Arabic-speaking countries' dialects. It comprises 3,556 hours from 19 Arabic dialects in addition to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). We used this dataset to train and evaluate various state-of-the-art ADI systems. We explored fine-tuning pre-trained ECAPA-TDNN-based models, as well as Whisper encoder blocks coupled with an attention pooling layer and a classification dense layer. We investigated the effect of (i) training data size and (ii) the model's number of parameters on identification performance. Our results show a small decrease in F1 score while using only 30% of the original training data. We open-source our collected data and trained models to enable the reproduction of our work, as well as support further research in ADI.

Abstract: With the growing number of submitted scientific papers, there is an increasing demand for systems that can assist reviewers in evaluating research claims. Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.

Abstract: This paper describes Elyadata \& LIA's joint submission to the NADI multi-dialectal Arabic Speech Processing 2025. We participated in the Spoken Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) and multi-dialectal Arabic ASR subtasks. Our submission ranked first for the ADI subtask and second for the multi-dialectal Arabic ASR subtask among all participants. Our ADI system is a fine-tuned Whisper-large-v3 encoder with data augmentation. This system obtained the highest ADI accuracy score of \textbf{79.83\%} on the official test set. For multi-dialectal Arabic ASR, we fine-tuned SeamlessM4T-v2 Large (Egyptian variant) separately for each of the eight considered dialects. Overall, we obtained an average WER and CER of \textbf{38.54\%} and \textbf{14.53\%}, respectively, on the test set. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of large pre-trained speech models with targeted fine-tuning for Arabic speech processing.

Motivation: 随着GPT等大语言模型的兴起，需要探索这些技术在军事应用中的潜力和可行性，包括模型自身对军事应用的认识以及商业云服务如何支持这类应用。

Method: 1) 通过询问GPT模型（微软Copilot）让其揭示自身对军事应用的知识；2) 研究微软Azure等商业云服务如何用于构建此类应用并评估可行性。

Result: 发现语言模型的摘要生成和内容生成特性直接支持多种军事应用，其他功能也可能找到特定用途。商业云服务能够相对容易地实现这些应用。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的总结和生成能力为军事应用提供了直接支持，通过商业云服务可以较为便捷地实现这些应用，但需要对其可行性和影响进行批判性评估。

Abstract: In this paper, military use cases or applications and implementation thereof are considered for natural language processing and large language models, which have broken into fame with the invention of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) and the extensive foundation model pretraining done by OpenAI for ChatGPT and others. First, we interrogate a GPT-based language model (viz. Microsoft Copilot) to make it reveal its own knowledge about their potential military applications and then critically assess the information. Second, we study how commercial cloud services (viz. Microsoft Azure) could be used readily to build such applications and assess which of them are feasible. We conclude that the summarization and generative properties of language models directly facilitate many applications at large and other features may find particular uses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体已成为监测灾难事件的重要工具，但现有系统存在事件相关偏见问题，影响其对新事件的泛化能力。因果学习和去偏见方法在灾难事件领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过因果视角进行偏见缓解，提出减少事件和领域相关偏见的方法。

Result: 方法在三个灾难分类任务中优于多个基线模型，F1分数提升高达+1.9%，并显著改进了基于预训练语言模型的分类器性能。

Conclusion: 基于因果推理的偏见缓解方法能有效提高社交媒体灾难事件分类系统的泛化能力。

Abstract: Due to the rapid growth of social media platforms, these tools have become essential for monitoring information during ongoing disaster events. However, extracting valuable insights requires real-time processing of vast amounts of data. A major challenge in existing systems is their exposure to event-related biases, which negatively affects their ability to generalize to emerging events. While recent advancements in debiasing and causal learning offer promising solutions, they remain underexplored in the disaster event domain. In this work, we approach bias mitigation through a causal lens and propose a method to reduce event- and domain-related biases, enhancing generalization to future events. Our approach outperforms multiple baselines by up to +1.9% F1 and significantly improves a PLM-based classifier across three disaster classification tasks.

TL;DR: VISTA是一个用于多轮推理任务的网络可视化交互系统，通过可视化上下文对模型决策的影响和交互式修改对话历史，帮助研究人员分析LLMs的复杂推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮交互中LLMs的推理过程分析面临复杂上下文依赖和缺乏专门可视化工具的挑战，导致研究人员认知负荷高。

Method: 开发基于web的可视化交互系统VISTA，支持可视化上下文影响、交互式修改对话历史进行what-if分析，并自动解析会话生成推理依赖树。

Result: VISTA显著降低了分析推理链的复杂性，促进了对当前LLMs能力和局限性的深入理解。

Conclusion: VISTA提供了一个统一交互框架来透明展示LLMs的逐步逻辑路径，平台开源且支持自定义基准和本地模型集成。

Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn interactions, as these scenarios more closely mirror real-world problem-solving. However, analyzing the intricate reasoning processes within these interactions presents a significant challenge due to complex contextual dependencies and a lack of specialized visualization tools, leading to a high cognitive load for researchers. To address this gap, we present VISTA, an web-based Visual Interactive System for Textual Analytics in multi-turn reasoning tasks. VISTA allows users to visualize the influence of context on model decisions and interactively modify conversation histories to conduct "what-if" analyses across different models. Furthermore, the platform can automatically parse a session and generate a reasoning dependency tree, offering a transparent view of the model's step-by-step logical path. By providing a unified and interactive framework, VISTA significantly reduces the complexity of analyzing reasoning chains, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of current LLMs. The platform is open-source and supports easy integration of custom benchmarks and local models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2SQL-Flow是一个SQL感知的数据增强框架，通过六个增强维度从少量种子数据生成大规模、语义有效且结构多样的Text-to-SQL对，构建了包含89,544个标注示例的SQLFlow数据集。该框架在开源和闭源LLM上都显著提升了Text-to-SQL性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Text-to-SQL领域因数据集稀缺、简单且多样性不足而限制性能的问题，建立可扩展的数据中心化基础。

Method: 提出Text2SQL-Flow框架，包含六个增强维度的数据增强、SQL执行验证、自然语言问题生成、思维链推理轨迹和数据分类。采用模块化数据库管理器确保跨数据库兼容性。对于闭源LLM，引入掩码对齐检索方法，将SQLFlow同时作为知识库和检索器训练数据。

Result: 构建了包含89,544个高质量标注示例的SQLFlow数据集。在开源LLM上，相同数据预算下在多个基准测试中性能持续提升；在闭源LLM上，检索策略优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 为推进Text-to-SQL系统建立了可扩展的数据中心化基础，强调了高质量结构化数据在现代AI中的关键作用。

Abstract: The data-centric paradigm has become pivotal in AI, especially for Text-to-SQL, where performance is limited by scarce, simplistic, and low-diversity datasets. To address this, we propose Text2SQL-Flow, a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, semantically valid, and structurally diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data. It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries. Experiments show our retrieval strategy outperforms existing methods, underscoring the value of SQLFlow's high-fidelity data and our novel technique. Our work establishes a scalable, data-centric foundation for advancing Text-to-SQL systems and highlights the critical role of high-quality structured data in modern AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EffiReason-Bench是一个统一的基准测试，用于评估高效推理方法，包括推理蓝图、动态执行和后处理优化三类方法。通过构建标准化的推理结构和E3-Score指标，在多个数据集和模型上评估了7种方法，发现最优策略取决于模型规模、任务复杂度和架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型使用思维链提示时会产生冗长的解释，增加成本并可能降低准确性。现有高效推理方法的评估实践分散，缺乏统一标准。

Method: 构建EffiReason-Bench基准，包含三个类别的高效推理方法：推理蓝图、动态执行和后处理优化。通过标准化推理结构、选项分析和人工验证构建CommonsenseQA和LogiQA的验证思维链注释。提出E3-Score指标进行平滑稳定评估。

Result: 在6个开源LLM（1B-70B）和4个数据集上评估了7种方法。实验表明没有单一方法在所有情况下都最优，最优策略取决于骨干模型规模、任务复杂度和架构。

Conclusion: 高效推理方法的选择需要根据具体场景定制，EffiReason-Bench为跨范式评估提供了统一框架，E3-Score提供了原则性的评估指标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting achieve strong reasoning but often produce unnecessarily long explanations, increasing cost and sometimes reducing accuracy. Fair comparison of efficiency-oriented approaches is hindered by fragmented evaluation practices. We introduce EffiReason-Bench, a unified benchmark for rigorous cross-paradigm evaluation of efficient reasoning methods across three categories: Reasoning Blueprints, Dynamic Execution, and Post-hoc Refinement. To enable step-by-step evaluation, we construct verified CoT annotations for CommonsenseQA and LogiQA via a pipeline that enforces standardized reasoning structures, comprehensive option-wise analysis, and human verification. We evaluate 7 methods across 6 open-source LLMs (1B-70B) on 4 datasets spanning mathematics, commonsense, and logic, and propose the E3-Score, a principled metric inspired by economic trade-off modeling that provides smooth, stable evaluation without discontinuities or heavy reliance on heuristics. Experiments show that no single method universally dominates; optimal strategies depend on backbone scale, task complexity, and architecture.

TL;DR: 提出了PAL框架，将人设对齐直接作为对话生成的训练目标，通过两阶段训练和选择后生成策略，在语义层面生成更相关的人设响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流模型通过token级语言模型训练隐式实现个性化，容易忽略给定人设并生成通用响应。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：人设感知学习和人设对齐，配备选择后生成推理策略。

Result: 实验表明该框架优于许多最先进的个性化对话方法和大型语言模型。

Conclusion: PAL框架通过直接优化人设对齐目标，显著提升了对话生成的人设相关性和一致性。

Abstract: Personalized dialogue generation aims to leverage persona profiles and dialogue history to generate persona-relevant and consistent responses. Mainstream models typically rely on token-level language model training with persona dialogue data, such as Next Token Prediction, to implicitly achieve personalization, making these methods tend to neglect the given personas and generate generic responses. To address this issue, we propose a novel Persona-Aware Alignment Framework (PAL), which directly treats persona alignment as the training objective of dialogue generation. Specifically, PAL employs a two-stage training method including Persona-aware Learning and Persona Alignment, equipped with an easy-to-use inference strategy Select then Generate, to improve persona sensitivity and generate more persona-relevant responses at the semantics level. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms many state-of-the-art personalized dialogue methods and large language models.

TL;DR: 提出了LangGPS框架，通过语言可分离性指导多语言训练数据选择，提升LLMs的多语言指令跟随能力和下游性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言训练数据选择方法通常忽略数据的内在语言结构，导致多语言能力对训练数据组成高度敏感。

Method: LangGPS是一个轻量级两阶段预选择框架：首先基于语言可分离性分数过滤训练数据，然后使用现有选择方法精炼子集。

Result: 在6个基准测试和22种语言的广泛实验中，LangGPS显著提升了现有选择方法的有效性和泛化能力，特别是在理解任务和低资源语言上。

Conclusion: 语言可分离性为多语言环境中的数据效用提供了新视角，支持开发更具语言意识的LLMs，同时可作为多语言课程学习的有效信号。

Abstract: Joint multilingual instruction tuning is a widely adopted approach to improve the multilingual instruction-following ability and downstream performance of large language models (LLMs), but the resulting multilingual capability remains highly sensitive to the composition and selection of the training data. Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains. Together, we hope our work offers a new perspective on data utility in multilingual contexts and support the development of more linguistically informed LLMs.

TL;DR: VocalNet-M2是一种低延迟语音语言模型，通过多码本分词器和多令牌预测策略显著降低响应延迟，从约725ms降至350ms，同时保持主流SLM的竞争性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端语音语言模型存在显著响应延迟问题，主要源于语音令牌的自回归生成和复杂流匹配模型的依赖，影响了实时交互应用的实用性。

Method: 提出VocalNet-M2模型，集成多码本分词器直接生成多码本语音令牌，避免使用延迟高的流匹配模型，并采用多令牌预测策略提高生成效率和性能。

Result: 实验表明VocalNet-M2大幅降低首块延迟（从约725ms到350ms），同时在主流SLM中保持竞争性性能，提供了单码本与多码本策略的全面比较。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发实时交互应用的高效高性能SLM提供了有价值的见解，证明了多码本策略在降低延迟方面的有效性。

Abstract: Current end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have made notable progress, yet they still encounter considerable response latency. This delay primarily arises from the autoregressive generation of speech tokens and the reliance on complex flow-matching models for speech synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce VocalNet-M2, a novel low-latency SLM that integrates a multi-codebook tokenizer and a multi-token prediction (MTP) strategy. Our model directly generates multi-codebook speech tokens, thus eliminating the need for a latency-inducing flow-matching model. Furthermore, our MTP strategy enhances generation efficiency and improves overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VocalNet-M2 achieves a substantial reduction in first chunk latency (from approximately 725ms to 350ms) while maintaining competitive performance across mainstream SLMs. This work also provides a comprehensive comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies, offering valuable insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MTR-DuplexBench基准，用于评估全双工语音语言模型在多轮对话中的表现，解决了现有基准在评估多轮通信、指令遵循和安全性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单轮交互和对话功能，忽视了多轮通信的复杂性以及指令遵循和安全性等关键能力，且在多轮设置中评估全双工语音语言模型面临对话边界模糊和上下文不一致的挑战。

Method: 通过将连续的全双工对话分割为离散的轮次，构建了MTR-DuplexBench基准，支持在对话质量、对话动态、指令遵循和安全性四个维度上对模型进行逐轮评估。

Result: 实验结果显示，当前的全双工语音语言模型在多个轮次和评估维度上难以保持一致的性能，验证了所提出基准的必要性和有效性。

Conclusion: MTR-DuplexBench基准填补了全双工语音语言模型评估的空白，为模型在多轮对话场景下的性能评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) enable real-time, overlapping conversational interactions, offering a more dynamic user experience compared to traditional half-duplex models. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating single-round interactions and conversational features, neglecting the complexities of multi-round communication and critical capabilities such as instruction following and safety. Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference. To address these gaps, we introduce MTR-DuplexBench, a novel benchmark that segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns, enabling comprehensive, turn-by-turn evaluation of FD-SLMs across dialogue quality, conversational dynamics, instruction following, and safety. Experimental results reveal that current FD-SLMs face difficulties in maintaining consistent performance across multiple rounds and evaluation dimensions, highlighting the necessity and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark. The benchmark and code will be available in the future.

Result: 在复杂查询（法律、科学、对话文档）上实现了竞争性准确率，同时保持所有数据在本地机器上，错误率极低。

Conclusion: 证明了在企业AI部署中，隐私和性能不必相互排斥，组织可以在不将专有信息传输给外部提供商的情况下获得可靠的AI问答能力。

Abstract: Organizations handling sensitive documents face a critical dilemma: adopt cloud-based AI systems that offer powerful question-answering capabilities but compromise data privacy, or maintain local processing that ensures security but delivers poor accuracy. We present a question-answering system that resolves this trade-off by combining semantic understanding with keyword precision, operating entirely on local infrastructure without internet access. Our approach demonstrates that organizations can achieve competitive accuracy on complex queries across legal, scientific, and conversational documents while keeping all data on their machines. By balancing two complementary retrieval strategies and using consumer-grade hardware acceleration, the system delivers reliable answers with minimal errors, letting banks, hospitals, and law firms adopt conversational document AI without transmitting proprietary information to external providers. This work establishes that privacy and performance need not be mutually exclusive in enterprise AI deployment.

Conclusion: 通过识别和纠正LLMs的不平衡评估偏好，本文提出的困惑度感知强化学习算法能够显著提升多步数学推理中的批判能力。

Abstract: To improve Multi-step Mathematical Reasoning (MsMR) of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is crucial to obtain scalable supervision from the corpus by automatically critiquing mistakes in the reasoning process of MsMR and rendering a final verdict of the problem-solution. Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct. Extensive experimental results on our built OPS and existing available critic benchmarks demonstrate the validity of our method.

Abstract: In the context of pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs), synthetic data has emerged as an alternative for generating high-quality pretraining data at scale. This is particularly beneficial in low-resource language settings where the benefits of recent LLMs have been unevenly distributed across languages. In this work, we present a systematic study on the generation and evaluation of synthetic multilingual pretraining data for Indic languages, where we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset BhashaKritika, comprising 540B tokens using 5 different techniques for 10 languages. We explore the impact of grounding generation in documents, personas, and topics. We analyze how language choice, both in the prompt instructions and document grounding, affects data quality, and we compare translations of English content with native generation in Indic languages. To support scalable and language-sensitive evaluation, we introduce a modular quality evaluation pipeline that integrates script and language detection, metadata consistency checks, n-gram repetition analysis, and perplexity-based filtering using KenLM models. Our framework enables robust quality control across diverse scripts and linguistic contexts. Empirical results through model runs reveal key trade-offs in generation strategies and highlight best practices for constructing effective multilingual corpora.

Motivation: 文化遗产文本包含丰富知识，但由于难以将非结构化论述转换为结构化知识图谱而难以系统查询。

Method: 结合标注模型、本体框架和LLM提取的五步迭代方法：基础分析、标注模式开发、管道架构、集成优化和综合评估。使用三个LLM（Claude Sonnet 3.7、Llama 3.3 70B、GPT-4o-mini）构建序列管道。

Result: 成功提取复杂文化遗产知识：元数据提取F1 0.96-0.99，实体识别F1 0.7-0.8，假设提取F1 0.65-0.75，证据提取F1 0.95-0.97，论述表示G-EVAL 0.62。较小模型表现竞争力强，可实现成本效益部署。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统协调LLM提取与文化遗产本体的方法，提供可复现框架，但限于维基百科文章，需要人工监督后处理。

Abstract: Cultural Heritage texts contain rich knowledge that is difficult to query systematically due to the challenges of converting unstructured discourse into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies. ATR4CH provides a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and institutional resources. Research Limitations - The produced KG is limited to Wikipedia articles. While the results are encouraging, human oversight is necessary during post-processing.

*Shuyi Liu,Yuming Shang,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TruthfulRAG是一个利用知识图谱解决RAG系统中事实级知识冲突的框架，通过构建知识图谱、图检索和基于熵的过滤机制来精确定位冲突元素，提高生成内容的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着外部知识库的扩展和模型参数知识的过时，RAG系统面临检索的外部信息与LLM内部知识之间冲突的挑战，这会严重影响生成内容的准确性和可靠性。现有方法通常在token或语义层面操作，难以全面理解事实层面的差异。

Method: TruthfulRAG从检索内容中系统提取三元组构建知识图谱，使用基于查询的图检索识别相关知识，并采用基于熵的过滤机制精确定位冲突元素，缓解事实不一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，TruthfulRAG优于现有方法，有效缓解知识冲突，提高了RAG系统的鲁棒性和可信度。

Conclusion: TruthfulRAG是首个利用知识图谱解决RAG系统中事实级知识冲突的框架，能够使LLM生成更忠实和准确的响应，为知识密集型任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval-based methods with generative models. As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.

### [44] [Position: On the Methodological Pitfalls of Evaluating Base LLMs for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10381)
*Jason Chan,Zhixue Zhao,Robert Gaizauskas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文认为评估基础大语言模型（仅预训练）的推理能力存在方法论问题，因为其预训练目标与推理评估的规范性标准（如正确性）存在根本性不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究评估基础LLMs的推理能力，但忽视了这些评估方法固有的方法论问题，特别是预训练目标与推理评估标准之间的不匹配。

Method: 通过分析基础LLMs的预训练目标（语言模式统计可能性）与推理评估标准（逻辑有效性、正确性）之间的根本差异，揭示评估方法的问题。

Result: 基础LLMs产生逻辑有效或无效结论只是语言模式统计可能性的偶然副产品，不能被视为其真正尝试给出正确答案。

Conclusion: 需要重新审视依赖这些假设的现有研究，未来工作应考虑这些方法论陷阱，并认识到基础LLMs的推理评估结论不能推广到经过指令优化的后训练LLMs。

Abstract: Existing work investigates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to uncover their limitations, human-like biases and underlying processes. Such studies include evaluations of base LLMs (pre-trained on unlabeled corpora only) for this purpose. Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies. We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed. In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility. This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following. We call for a critical re-examination of existing work that relies implicitly on these assumptions, and for future work to account for these methodological pitfalls.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DELICATE方法，一种结合BERT编码器和Wikidata上下文信息的神经符号化实体链接方法，专门用于历史意大利语文本，同时创建了ENEIDE多领域实体链接语料库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人文学科中实体链接面临的挑战，包括复杂文档类型、缺乏领域特定数据集和模型，以及知识库中代表性不足的长尾实体问题。

Method: DELICATE方法结合BERT编码器与Wikidata上下文信息，利用时间合理性和实体类型一致性来选择知识库实体；同时构建了ENEIDE多领域历史意大利语实体链接语料库。

Result: DELICATE在历史意大利语实体链接任务中优于其他模型，即使与具有数十亿参数的大型架构相比；其置信度分数和特征敏感性提供了比纯神经方法更可解释的结果。

Conclusion: DELICATE方法在历史意大利语实体链接任务中表现出色，提供了更好的可解释性，ENEIDE语料库为领域研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: In spite of the remarkable advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing, the task of Entity Linking (EL) remains challenging in the field of humanities due to complex document typologies, lack of domain-specific datasets and models, and long-tail entities, i.e., entities under-represented in Knowledge Bases (KBs). The goal of this paper is to address these issues with two main contributions. The first contribution is DELICATE, a novel neuro-symbolic method for EL on historical Italian which combines a BERT-based encoder with contextual information from Wikidata to select appropriate KB entities using temporal plausibility and entity type consistency. The second contribution is ENEIDE, a multi-domain EL corpus in historical Italian semi-automatically extracted from two annotated editions spanning from the 19th to the 20th century and including literary and political texts. Results show how DELICATE outperforms other EL models in historical Italian even if compared with larger architectures with billions of parameters. Moreover, further analyses reveal how DELICATE confidence scores and features sensitivity provide results which are more explainable and interpretable than purely neural methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过类比范式组织，让轻量级模型用极少量数据达到与大数据训练的大语言模型相媲美的性能，解决数据效率问题。

Method: 开发计算框架实现三个认知启发原则：类比结构、对比学习和最小上下文线索。使用结构化完形填空任务，让模型从类比模式中识别正确句子补全。

Result: 在仅100个英语使役/起始交替的结构化示例上训练轻量模型（50万参数），F1得分达0.95，优于零样本GPT-3的0.87。消融研究证实类比组织和对比结构提升性能。

Conclusion: 类比范式组织能以比传统方法少几个数量级的数据实现有竞争力的语言规则学习，证明了数据效率的显著提升。

Abstract: Large language models achieve strong performance through training on vast datasets. Can analogical paradigm organization enable lightweight models to match this performance with minimal data? We develop a computational approach implementing three cognitive-inspired principles: analogical structure, contrastive learning, and minimal contextual cues. We test this approach with structured completion tasks where models identify correct sentence completions from analogical patterns with contrastive alternatives. Training lightweight models (BERT+CNN, $0.5M$ parameters) on only one hundred structured examples of English causative/inchoative alternations achieves $F1=0.95$, outperforming zero-shot \texttt{GPT-o3} ($F1=0.87$). Ablation studies confirm that analogical organization and contrastive structure improve performance, consistently surpassing randomly shuffled baselines across architectures. Cross-phenomenon validation using unspecified object alternations replicates these efficiency gains, confirming approach robustness. Our results show that analogical paradigm organization enables competitive linguistic rule learning with orders of magnitude less data than conventional approaches require.

TL;DR: 提出一种针对模糊请求生成多个解释-答案对的方法，通过强化学习和定制奖励函数训练模型，在单次生成中覆盖更多有效答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理模糊请求时通常只给出单一解释，这种意图误解会使用户感到沮丧并带来安全风险。

Method: 使用强化学习和定制奖励函数训练模型，以多个有效答案作为监督信号，在单一结构化响应中生成多个解释-答案对。

Result: 在对话问答和语义解析任务上的实验表明，该方法比基线方法实现了更高的有效答案覆盖率。人工评估确认预测解释与答案高度一致。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式解释提高透明度，只需一次生成步骤实现高效性，并通过结构化输出格式支持下游应用。

Abstract: Large language models often respond to ambiguous requests by implicitly committing to one interpretation. Intent misunderstandings can frustrate users and create safety risks. To address this, we propose generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single structured response to ambiguous requests. Our models are trained with reinforcement learning and customized reward functions using multiple valid answers as supervision. Experiments on conversational question answering and semantic parsing demonstrate that our method achieves higher coverage of valid answers than baseline approaches. Human evaluation confirms that predicted interpretations are highly aligned with their answers. Our approach promotes transparency with explicit interpretations, achieves efficiency by requiring only one generation step, and supports downstream applications through its structured output format.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在解决复杂任务方面表现出色，本文旨在专门研究其在状态跟踪这一需要保持多个实体状态的问题上的能力。

Method: 提出了基于三个明确定义的状态跟踪任务的基准测试，分析LLMs在不同场景下的性能，特别关注了思维链等机制的影响。

Result: 新一代LLMs（GPT-4和Llama3）能够有效跟踪状态，特别是结合思维链机制时；而前代模型虽然理解任务并能解决初始阶段，但在多个步骤后往往会失败。

Conclusion: 新一代大型语言模型在状态跟踪任务上表现出色，但前代模型存在长期跟踪能力不足的问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in solving complex tasks, including those requiring a certain level of reasoning. In this paper, we focus on state tracking, a problem where models need to keep track of the state governing a number of entities. To isolate the state tracking component from other factors, we propose a benchmark based on three well-defined state tracking tasks and analyse the performance of LLMs in different scenarios. The results indicate that the recent generation of LLMs (specifically, GPT-4 and Llama3) are capable of tracking state, especially when integrated with mechanisms such as Chain of Thought. However, models from the former generation, while understanding the task and being able to solve it at the initial stages, often fail at this task after a certain number of steps.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LocalBench是首个系统评估LLMs在美国县级本地知识能力的基准，包含14,782个验证问答对，覆盖526个县。评估显示现有模型在本地知识方面存在严重局限，最佳模型在叙事类问题准确率仅56.8%，数值推理低于15.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注宏观地理任务，缺乏对超本地知识的评估能力，而现实应用需要AI系统能够理解社区特定动态、文化叙事和本地治理。

Method: 基于本地性概念框架构建LocalBench基准，整合人口普查数据、本地subreddit讨论和区域新闻，涵盖物理、认知和关系三个维度。评估13个最先进LLMs在闭卷和网络增强设置下的表现。

Result: 模型表现不佳：最佳模型在叙事类问题准确率56.8%，数值推理低于15.5%。更大模型规模和网络增强不保证更好性能，搜索使Gemini准确率提升13.6%，但使GPT系列下降11.4%。

Conclusion: 迫切需要开发能够支持公平、位置感知AI系统的语言模型，能够参与不同地理和文化背景下本地社区的精细现实。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on macro-scale geographic tasks, such as global factual recall, event summarization, and regional reasoning. Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于激发的提示优化方法在知识密集型任务中存在根本性限制，因为它们只在固定参数边界内操作，无法提供专业领域所需的事实知识、术语精度和推理模式。

Method: KPPO框架包含三个关键创新：1) 知识差距填补机制；2) 批量候选评估方法；3) 自适应知识剪枝策略。

Result: 在15个知识密集型基准测试上的广泛评估显示，KPPO优于基于激发的方法，平均性能提升约6%，同时实现相当或更低的token消耗。

Conclusion: KPPO通过系统知识整合而非潜在激发，有效解决了知识密集型任务中的提示优化问题，在性能和效率方面均取得显著改进。

Abstract: While prompt optimization has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing language model performance, existing approaches primarily focus on elicitation-based strategies that search for optimal prompts to activate models' capabilities. These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

Conclusion: 评分标准成为训练和评估大语言模型高级指令跟随能力的强大工具，为开发更可靠和强大的AI系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has led to impressive performance on a range of tasks, yet advanced instruction following (IF)-especially for complex, multi-turn, and system-prompted instructions-remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation and effective training for such capabilities are hindered by the lack of high-quality, human-annotated benchmarks and reliable, interpretable reward signals. In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL. This work establishes rubrics as a powerful tool for both training and evaluating advanced IF in LLMs, paving the way for more capable and reliable AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全评估主要关注语义等价的越狱提示，但忽略了语言风格变化作为攻击面的潜在风险。

Method: 构建风格增强的越狱基准，将3个标准数据集的提示转换为11种不同语言风格，使用手工模板和LLM重写，同时保持语义意图。评估16个开源和闭源指令调优模型。

Result: 风格重构使越狱成功率提升高达57个百分点。恐惧、好奇和同情等风格最有效，上下文重写优于模板变体。风格中和预处理显著降低越狱成功率。

Conclusion: 语言风格变换揭示了当前安全流程中被忽视的系统性且难以扩展的漏洞。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated for robustness against paraphrased or semantically equivalent jailbreak prompts, yet little attention has been paid to linguistic variation as an attack surface. In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.
  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates. Our findings reveal a systemic and scaling-resistant vulnerability overlooked in current safety pipelines.

Motivation: 现有对话记忆评估基准存在统计能力不足、数据生成不一致和评估灵活性有限等问题，需要更全面的评估框架来推动对话记忆系统的发展。

Method: 构建了涵盖用户事实、助手回忆、弃权、偏好、时间变化和隐式连接等多样类别的综合基准，比较了全上下文方法与RAG系统在不同对话长度下的表现。

Result: 简单全上下文方法在最具挑战性的多消息证据案例中达到70-82%准确率，而复杂RAG系统在150次对话内仅达到30-45%。长上下文方法在前30次对话中表现最佳，在150次对话内仍可行，超过此阈值需要混合或RAG方法。

Conclusion: 对话记忆具有小语料优势，其中穷举搜索和完全重排序是可行的，这值得专门研究关注，而不是简单地将通用RAG解决方案应用于对话历史。

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for conversational memory evaluation containing 75,336 question-answer pairs across diverse categories including user facts, assistant recall, abstention, preferences, temporal changes, and implicit connections. While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.

Motivation: 探讨体裁作为形式分类与制度分类的合理性，分析当代文学中体裁小说与文学小说的形式特征差异。

Method: 使用CONLIT数据集构建语料库，应用Welch's ANOVA比较叙事特征分布，使用逻辑回归建模文学分类效果，分析风格和语义向量表示。

Result: 发现每个文学类别都有统计显著的形式标记，女性作者身份对获得文学地位的标准产生缩小和模糊效应。

Conclusion: 体裁确实具有形式上的区分特征，但作者性别因素会影响文学地位的评判标准，女性作者面临更严格的文学分类标准。

Abstract: Though the concept of genre has been a subject of discussion for millennia, the relatively recent emergence of genre fiction has added a new layer to this ongoing conversation. While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction. Then, we use logistic regression to model the effect that each feature has on literary classification and to measure how author gender moderates these effects. Finally, we analyze stylistic and semantic vector representations of our genre categories to understand the importance of form and content in literary classification. This project finds statistically significant formal markers of each literary category and illustrates how female authorship narrows and blurs the target for achieving literary status.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在长文档理解中的两个核心问题：大量无关内容的信息干扰，以及Transformer架构的二次计算成本。现有方法要么牺牲细节，要么增加系统复杂度。

Method: 提出URaG框架，引入轻量级跨模态检索模块，将早期Transformer层转换为证据选择器，识别并保留最相关页面，丢弃无关内容，让深层层专注于相关信息。

Result: 在广泛实验中，URaG实现了最先进的性能，同时将计算开销减少了44-56%。

Conclusion: URaG成功展示了利用MLLMs内在证据定位能力进行检索的可行性，为高效长文档理解提供了简单而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with long document understanding due to two fundamental challenges: information interference from abundant irrelevant content, and the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based architectures. Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%. The code is available at https://github.com/shi-yx/URaG.

Abstract: Fine-grained sentiment analysis faces ongoing challenges in Aspect Sentiment Triple Extraction (ASTE), particularly in accurately capturing the relationships between aspects, opinions, and sentiment polarities. While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart. Our findings suggest that upgrading to more advanced language models when thoughtfully integrated, can lead to real improvements in how well we can analyze sentiments in text. The implementation of our approach is publicly available at: https://github.com/VishalRepos/DESS.

Motivation: 准确提取医患对话中的医疗订单对于减轻临床文档负担和确保患者安全至关重要。

Method: 系统评估了三种提示范式：单样本方法、推理导向的ReAct框架和多步骤智能体工作流。

Result: 虽然复杂框架功能强大，但简单的单样本提示方法在官方验证集上取得了最高性能。

Conclusion: 在手动标注的转录本上，复杂推理链可能导致"过度思考"并引入噪声，使直接方法更加稳健高效。

Abstract: The accurate extraction of medical orders from doctor-patient conversations is a critical task for reducing clinical documentation burdens and ensuring patient safety. This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow. Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting method achieved the highest performance on the official validation set. We posit that on manually annotated transcripts, complex reasoning chains can lead to "overthinking" and introduce noise, making a direct approach more robust and efficient. Our work provides valuable insights into selecting appropriate prompting strategies for clinical information extraction in varied data conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种互补的方法来生成伤口护理查询的文本回复：基于挖掘提示的策略和基于元数据引导的生成方法，旨在提高AI系统在异步远程护理中的效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异步远程护理的快速发展增加了医护人员的工作负担，需要AI系统来更高效地管理患者查询，特别是针对带有图像的伤口护理查询。

Method: 1. 挖掘提示策略：嵌入训练数据并检索最相似的示例作为少样本演示；2. 元数据引导生成：通过元数据消融研究识别出四个能提升回复质量的元数据属性，训练分类器预测这些属性并动态调整生成过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，挖掘提示提高了回复的相关性，而元数据引导生成进一步提升了临床精确性。

Conclusion: 这两种方法为开发能够提供可靠高效伤口护理支持的AI驱动工具指明了有前景的方向。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of asynchronous remote care has intensified provider workload, creating demand for AI systems that can assist clinicians in managing patient queries more efficiently. The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision. Together, these methods highlight promising directions for developing AI-driven tools that can provide reliable and efficient wound care support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种编码器增强的因果解码器模型架构，能够更高效地估计语言熵，并证明在接近但不超过估计的每词元熵值的情况下训练模型，可以获得更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于因果（下一个词元预测）的大型语言模型虽然是最有效的语言压缩算法，但用它们来准确估计语言熵在计算上不可行。需要找到更高效的方法来估计语言熵，并研究熵与模型泛化能力的关系。

Method: 引入了编码器增强的因果解码器模型架构，该架构具有更好的训练效率特性，即使在适度硬件上训练也能实现比因果变换器更高的压缩率。展示了如何基于每词元获得熵估计。

Result: 证明了当模型训练接近但不超出训练数据的估计熵值时，其泛化能力必然超过那些训练损失超过此值的模型。经验表明，考虑熵值训练的因果模型比不考虑熵值的模型具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 编码器增强的因果解码器架构能够更高效地估计语言熵，通过将模型训练控制在接近但不超出估计熵值的范围内，可以显著提升模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Language prediction is constrained by informational entropy intrinsic to language, such that there exists a limit to how accurate any language model can become and equivalently a lower bound to language compression. The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language entropy is currently computationally infeasible. We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value. We show empirically that causal models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet existing test-time frameworks often rely on coarse self-verification and self-correction, limiting their effectiveness on complex tasks. In this paper, we propose Socratic Self-Refine (SSR), a novel framework for fine-grained evaluation and precise refinement of LLM reasoning. Our proposed SSR decomposes model responses into verifiable (sub-question, sub-answer) pairs, enabling step-level confidence estimation through controlled re-solving and self-consistency checks. By pinpointing unreliable steps and iteratively refining them, SSR produces more accurate and interpretable reasoning chains. Empirical results across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs show that SSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art iterative self-refinement baselines. Beyond performance gains, SSR provides a principled black-box approach for evaluating and understanding the internal reasoning processes of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/socratic-self-refine-reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet the majority of high-performing models remain closed-source or partially open, limiting transparency and reproducibility. In this work, we introduce Instella, a family of fully open three billion parameter language models trained entirely on openly available data and codebase. Powered by AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs, Instella is developed through large-scale pre-training, general-purpose instruction tuning, and alignment with human preferences.

We further release two specialized variants: Instella-Long, capable of handling context lengths up to 128K tokens, and Instella-Math, a reasoning-focused model enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on mathematical tasks. Together, these contributions establish Instella as a transparent, performant, and versatile alternative for the community, advancing the goal of open and reproducible language modeling research.

Motivation: 解决黑盒蒸馏中无法访问教师模型内部logits或参数的问题，实现仅基于文本输出的有效知识蒸馏。

Method: 将学生LLM作为生成器，训练判别器区分师生模型响应，形成极小极大博弈框架，判别器作为在线奖励模型提供自适应反馈。

Result: GAD持续超越常用的序列级知识蒸馏方法，Qwen2.5-14B学生模型在LMSYS-Chat自动评估中性能接近GPT-5-Chat教师模型。

Conclusion: GAD是黑盒LLM蒸馏中一个有前景且有效的范式。

Abstract: Black-box distillation creates student large language models (LLMs) by learning from a proprietary teacher model's text outputs alone, without access to its internal logits or parameters. In this work, we introduce Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD), which enables on-policy and black-box distillation. GAD frames the student LLM as a generator and trains a discriminator to distinguish its responses from the teacher LLM's, creating a minimax game. The discriminator acts as an on-policy reward model that co-evolves with the student, providing stable, adaptive feedback. Experimental results show that GAD consistently surpasses the commonly used sequence-level knowledge distillation. In particular, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (student) trained with GAD becomes comparable to its teacher, GPT-5-Chat, on the LMSYS-Chat automatic evaluation. The results establish GAD as a promising and effective paradigm for black-box LLM distillation.

TL;DR: ParoQuant是一种仅量化权重的后训练量化方法，通过成对旋转量化和通道级缩放来减少LLM中的异常值影响，在推理任务上比AWQ平均提升2.4%准确率，且开销低于10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中的权重和激活值存在异常值，导致量化误差大和精度严重下降，特别是在推理任务中误差会在长思维链中累积。现有PTQ方法要么无法充分抑制异常值，要么在推理时引入显著开销。

Method: 结合硬件高效的独立Givens旋转与通道级缩放，均衡通道间幅度并缩小每个量化组内的动态范围，同时协同设计推理内核以充分利用GPU并行性，保持旋转和缩放操作在运行时轻量。

Result: 在推理任务上比AWQ平均提升2.4%准确率，同时保持低于10%的开销。

Conclusion: 该方法为推理LLM的更高效和准确部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) compresses the weights of Large Language Models (LLMs) into low-precision representations to reduce memory footprint and accelerate inference. However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often leads to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We further co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime. ParoQuant achieves an average 2.4% accuracy improvement over AWQ on reasoning tasks with less than 10% overhead. This paves the way for more efficient and accurate deployment of reasoning LLMs.

Motivation: 在隐私保护的移动网络传输场景中，现有方法主要关注特征空间一致性和分类个性化，但忽视了提取器的局部适应性和分类器的全局泛化性，导致组件间协调不足、耦合弱，最终降低模型性能。

Method: 联合学习全局和局部特征表示；使用动态知识蒸馏增强个性化分类器的泛化；引入锚点来精炼特征空间，其严格的局部性和非传输性天然保护隐私并减少通信开销。

Result: 在五个图像分类数据集上的广泛实验表明，FedeCouple在有效性、稳定性、可扩展性和安全性方面始终优于九种基线方法。在有效性评估实验中，FedeCouple显著超越最佳基线方法4.3%。

Conclusion: FedeCouple通过精细平衡全局泛化与局部适应性，解决了联邦学习中组件协调不足的问题，理论分析证明其在非凸目标下收敛，实验验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: In privacy-preserving mobile network transmission scenarios with heterogeneous client data, personalized federated learning methods that decouple feature extractors and classifiers have demonstrated notable advantages in enhancing learning capability. However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis proving that FedeCouple converges for nonconvex objectives, with iterates approaching a stationary point as the number of communication rounds increases. Extensive experiments conducted on five image-classification datasets demonstrate that FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baseline methods in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security. Notably, in experiments evaluating effectiveness, FedeCouple surpasses the best baseline by a significant margin of 4.3%.

Conclusion: MMaDA-Parallel为思维感知图像合成建立了更鲁棒的范式，有效解决了现有方法中的错误传播问题。

Abstract: While thinking-aware generation aims to improve performance on complex tasks, we identify a critical failure mode where existing sequential, autoregressive approaches can paradoxically degrade performance due to error propagation. To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.

Abstract: Non-human primates are our closest living relatives, and analyzing their behavior is central to research in cognition, evolution, and conservation. Computer vision could greatly aid this research, but existing methods often rely on human-centric pretrained models and focus on single datasets, which limits generalization. We address this limitation by shifting from a model-centric to a data-centric approach and introduce PriVi, a large-scale primate-centric video pretraining dataset. PriVi contains 424 hours of curated video, combining 174 hours from behavioral research across 11 settings with 250 hours of diverse web-sourced footage, assembled through a scalable data curation pipeline. We pretrain V-JEPA on PriVi to learn primate-specific representations and evaluate it using a lightweight frozen classifier. Across four benchmark datasets, ChimpACT, BaboonLand, PanAf500, and ChimpBehave, our approach consistently outperforms prior work, including fully finetuned baselines, and scales favorably with fewer labels. These results demonstrate that primate-centric pretraining substantially improves data efficiency and generalization, making it a promising approach for low-label applications. Code, models, and the majority of the dataset will be made available.

Abstract: Phonotrauma refers to vocal fold tissue damage resulting from exposure to forces during voicing. It occurs on a continuum from mild to severe, and treatment options can vary based on severity. Assessment of severity involves a clinician's expert judgment, which is costly and can vary widely in reliability. In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions. Our proposed soft ordinal regression method achieves predictive performance approaching that of clinical experts, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. By providing an automated tool for phonotrauma severity assessment, our work can enable large-scale studies of phonotrauma, ultimately leading to improved clinical understanding and patient care.

Conclusion: 这是首个探索指令式图像编辑模型中连续精细指令控制的框架，为交互式指令驱动图像操作开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing models have recently achieved impressive performance, enabling complex edits to an input image from a multi-instruction prompt. However, these models apply each instruction in the prompt with a fixed strength, limiting the user's ability to precisely and continuously control the intensity of individual edits. We introduce SliderEdit, a framework for continuous image editing with fine-grained, interpretable instruction control. Given a multi-part edit instruction, SliderEdit disentangles the individual instructions and exposes each as a globally trained slider, allowing smooth adjustment of its strength. Unlike prior works that introduced slider-based attribute controls in text-to-image generation, typically requiring separate training or fine-tuning for each attribute or concept, our method learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions. This enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while preserving both spatial locality and global semantic consistency. We apply SliderEdit to state-of-the-art image editing models, including FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit, and observe substantial improvements in edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore and propose a framework for continuous, fine-grained instruction control in instruction-based image editing models. Our results pave the way for interactive, instruction-driven image manipulation with continuous and compositional control.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了视频人群密度估计的挑战，提供了一个高效可扩展的实时监控解决方案。

Abstract: This study enhances a crowd density estimation algorithm originally designed for image-based analysis by adapting it for video-based scenarios. The proposed method integrates a denoising probabilistic model that utilizes diffusion processes to generate high-quality crowd density maps. To improve accuracy, narrow Gaussian kernels are employed, and multiple density map outputs are generated. A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including overlay plots and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the model demonstrates its ability to effectively capture crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings. The efficiency of the sampling method is further assessed, showcasing its capability to decrease frame counts while maintaining essential crowd events. By addressing the temporal challenges unique to video analysis, this work offers a scalable and efficient framework for real-time crowd monitoring in applications such as public safety, disaster response, and event management.

Motivation: 解决GPS信号缺失环境下的室内定位问题，克服现有视觉方法在智能手机LiDAR范围短和室内布局模糊性方面的限制。

Method: 使用基础单目深度估计模型(Depth Pro)从RGB图像重建尺度对齐的3D点云，然后通过与平面图进行卷积实现几何布局匹配，输出位置和方向的后验分布。

Result: 在Structured3D和校园数据集上评估，PALMS+在静态定位精度上优于PALMS和F3Loc，无需训练；在33条真实轨迹上集成粒子滤波器后，定位误差更低。

Abstract: Indoor localization in GPS-denied environments is crucial for applications like emergency response and assistive navigation. Vision-based methods such as PALMS enable infrastructure-free localization using only a floor plan and a stationary scan, but are limited by the short range of smartphone LiDAR and ambiguity in indoor layouts. We propose PALMS$+$, a modular, image-based system that addresses these challenges by reconstructing scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using a foundation monocular depth estimation model (Depth Pro), followed by geometric layout matching via convolution with the floor plan. PALMS$+$ outputs a posterior over the location and orientation, usable for direct or sequential localization. Evaluated on the Structured3D and a custom campus dataset consisting of 80 observations across four large campus buildings, PALMS$+$ outperforms PALMS and F3Loc in stationary localization accuracy -- without requiring any training. Furthermore, when integrated with a particle filter for sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories, PALMS$+$ achieved lower localization errors compared to other methods, demonstrating robustness for camera-free tracking and its potential for infrastructure-free applications.

Conclusion: 提出的动态占用空间损失函数能有效指导模型学习避免现实碰撞，在不同人群密度条件下均能提升轨迹预测性能。

Abstract: In dynamic and crowded environments, realistic pedestrian trajectory prediction remains a challenging task due to the complex nature of human motion and the mutual influences among individuals. Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline. Moreover, the proposed model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models across most test sets.

Abstract: Soiling detection for automotive cameras is a crucial part of advanced driver assistance systems to make them more robust to external conditions like weather, dust, etc. In this paper, we regard the soiling detection as a semantic segmentation problem. We provide a comprehensive comparison of popular segmentation methods and show their superiority in performance while comparing them to tile-level classification approaches. Moreover, we present an extensive analysis of the Woodscape dataset showing that the original dataset contains a data-leakage and imprecise annotations. To address these problems, we create a new data subset, which, despite being much smaller, provides enough information for the segmentation method to reach comparable results in a much shorter time.

Method: 评估8个医学和通用领域基础模型的视觉编码器，使用线性探测和微调方法，在胸部X光分析中测试分类（气胸、心脏肥大）和分割（气胸、心脏边界）任务。

Result: 医学基础模型在线性探测中始终优于通用领域模型；预训练嵌入在全局分类和突出解剖结构分割中表现良好，但在复杂细微病理分割中表现不佳；发现模型使用混淆捷径进行分类；图像仅和监督方法表现优异；监督端到端基线在分割任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 医学预训练有益，但架构选择至关重要；预训练特征并非普遍有效，特别是在复杂定位任务中，监督模型仍是强有力替代方案；昂贵的文本图像对齐不是必要条件。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) promise to generalize medical imaging, but their effectiveness varies. It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.

Abstract: Developing reliable iris recognition and presentation attack detection methods requires diverse datasets that capture realistic variations in iris features and a wide spectrum of anomalies. Because of the rich texture of iris images, which spans a wide range of spatial frequencies, synthesizing same-identity iris images while controlling specific attributes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a new iris image augmentation strategy by traversing a generative model's latent space toward latent codes that represent same-identity samples but with some desired iris image properties manipulated. The latent space traversal is guided by a gradient of specific geometrical, textural, or quality-related iris image features (e.g., sharpness, pupil size, iris size, or pupil-to-iris ratio) and preserves the identity represented by the image being manipulated. The proposed approach can be easily extended to manipulate any attribute for which a differentiable loss term can be formulated. Additionally, our approach can use either randomly generated images using either a pre-train GAN model or real-world iris images. We can utilize GAN inversion to project any given iris image into the latent space and obtain its corresponding latent code.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation and tracking are fundamental capabilities for physical AI systems such as robots. However, existing approaches typically rely on a manually annotated segmentation mask of the target in the first frame, which is labor-intensive and leads to reduced performance when faced with occlusions or rapid movement. To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation. Another key innovation is our automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring and recovers from severe occlusions or rapid motion. STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets featuring multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training. This annotation-free approach significantly reduces deployment overhead, providing a practical solution for modern applications, such as flexible manufacturing and intelligent quality control.

Abstract: Exemplar-Free Continual Learning (EFCL) restricts the storage of previous task data and is highly susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but often degrade under test-time domain shifts. For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

Abstract: Restoring 3D scenes captured under low-light con- ditions remains a fundamental yet challenging problem. Most existing approaches depend on precomputed camera poses and scene-specific optimization, which greatly restricts their scala- bility to dynamic real-world environments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Lumos3D, a generalizable pose-free framework for 3D low-light scene restoration. Trained once on a single dataset, Lumos3D performs inference in a purely feed- forward manner, directly restoring illumination and structure from unposed, low-light multi-view images without any per- scene training or optimization. Built upon a geometry-grounded backbone, Lumos3D reconstructs a normal-light 3D Gaussian representation that restores illumination while faithfully pre- serving structural details. During training, a cross-illumination distillation scheme is employed, where the teacher network is distilled on normal-light ground truth to transfer accurate geometric information, such as depth, to the student model. A dedicated Lumos loss is further introduced to promote photomet- ric consistency within the reconstructed 3D space. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Lumos3D achieves high- fidelity low-light 3D scene restoration with accurate geometry and strong generalization to unseen cases. Furthermore, the framework naturally extends to handle over-exposure correction, highlighting its versatility for diverse lighting restoration tasks.

Abstract: Cross-view image retrieval, particularly street-to-satellite matching, is a critical task for applications such as autonomous navigation, urban planning, and localization in GPS-denied environments. However, existing approaches often require supervised training on curated datasets and rely on panoramic or UAV-based images, which limits real-world deployment. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective cross-view image retrieval framework that leverages a pretrained vision encoder and a large language model (LLM), requiring no additional training. Given a monocular street-view image, our method extracts geographic cues through web-based image search and LLM-based location inference, generates a satellite query via geocoding API, and retrieves matching tiles using a pretrained vision encoder (e.g., DINOv2) with PCA-based whitening feature refinement. Despite using no ground-truth supervision or finetuning, our proposed method outperforms prior learning-based approaches on the benchmark dataset under zero-shot settings. Moreover, our pipeline enables automatic construction of semantically aligned street-to-satellite datasets, which is offering a scalable and cost-efficient alternative to manual annotation.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for animating humans in 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a neural scene representation that has recently achieved state-of-the-art photorealistic results for novel-view synthesis but remains under-explored for human-scene animation and interaction. Unlike existing animation pipelines that use meshes or point clouds as the underlying 3D representation, our approach introduces the use of 3DGS as the 3D representation to the problem of animating humans in scenes. By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework allows for novel applications such as geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with new animated humans, showcasing the unique advantage of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks inject localized perturbations into images to mislead deep vision models. These attacks can be physically deployed, posing serious risks to real-world applications. In this paper, we propose CertMask, a certifiably robust defense that constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks to neutralize patch effects with strong theoretical guarantees. While the state-of-the-art approach (PatchCleanser) requires two rounds of masking and incurs $O(n^2)$ inference cost, CertMask performs only a single round of masking with $O(n)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the cardinality of the mask set to cover an input image. Our proposed mask set is computed using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each possible patch location is covered at least $k$ times, providing both efficiency and robustness. We offer a theoretical analysis of the coverage condition and prove its sufficiency for certification. Experiments on ImageNet, ImageNette, and CIFAR-10 show that CertMask improves certified robust accuracy by up to +13.4\% over PatchCleanser, while maintaining clean accuracy nearly identical to the vanilla model.

Abstract: Space weather at Earth, driven by the solar activity, poses growing risks to satellites around our planet as well as to critical ground-based technological infrastructure. Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures. Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks. As a first proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions. The code and configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used in various fields, including augmented reality (AR) and robotics, where relighting and texture editing are crucial for realistic visualization. Achieving these tasks requires accurately separating albedo from shade. However, performing this separation on point clouds presents two key challenges: (1) the non-grid structure of point clouds makes conventional image-based decomposition models ineffective, and (2) point-cloud models designed for other tasks do not explicitly consider global-light direction, resulting in inaccurate shade. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Intrinsic Point-Cloud Decomposition (IPCD)}, which extends image decomposition to the direct decomposition of colored point clouds into albedo and shade. To overcome challenge (1), we propose \textbf{IPCD-Net} that extends image-based model with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid data processing. For challenge (2), we introduce \textbf{Projection-based Luminance Distribution (PLD)} with a hierarchical feature refinement, capturing global-light ques via multi-view projection. For comprehensive evaluation, we create a synthetic outdoor-scene dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that IPCD-Net reduces cast shadows in albedo and enhances color accuracy in shade. Furthermore, we showcase its applications in texture editing, relighting, and point-cloud registration under varying illumination. Finally, we verify the real-world applicability of IPCD-Net.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在使用ROPE时面临长距离依赖建模挑战，ROPE虽然能精确建模token位置，但会导致注意力随距离增加而衰减，损害模型记忆全局上下文的能力。

Method: 提出推理阶段的三步衰减恢复策略T-DRS：1) SD-DRS通过内容感知残差放大语义相关但距离较远的信号；2) DC-DRS基于位置距离平滑调节权重来净化注意力；3) reRD-DRS巩固剩余的信息性远距离依赖以保持全局一致性。

Result: 在视觉问答基准上的大量实验表明，T-DRS能够以训练免费的方式持续提升性能。

Conclusion: T-DRS策略能够在不损害局部归纳偏置的情况下恢复被抑制的长距离token对，有效缓解ROPE引起的注意力衰减问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks. However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence. Together, the T-DRS recover suppressed long-range token pairs without harming local inductive biases. Extensive experiments on Vision Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks demonstrate that T-DRS can consistently improve performance in a training-free manner.

Motivation: 直接应用SAM到RGB-D视频显著目标检测面临三个挑战：手动提示依赖、序列适配器的高内存消耗和内存注意力的计算负担。

Method: 部署并行适配器多模态图像编码器（PAMIE）和查询驱动时序记忆（QTM）模块，通过深度引导并行适配器融合多模态特征，利用帧级和视频级查询提取时序一致性特征。

Conclusion: SAM-DAQ成功将SAM2适配到RGB-D视频显著目标检测，通过深度和时序线索的统一集成实现了优越性能。

Abstract: Recently segment anything model (SAM) has attracted widespread concerns, and it is often treated as a vision foundation model for universal segmentation. Some researchers have attempted to directly apply the foundation model to the RGB-D video salient object detection (RGB-D VSOD) task, which often encounters three challenges, including the dependence on manual prompts, the high memory consumption of sequential adapters, and the computational burden of memory attention. To address the limitations, we propose a novel method, namely Segment Anything Model with Depth-guided Adaptive Queries (SAM-DAQ), which adapts SAM2 to pop-out salient objects from videos by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal cues within a unified framework. Firstly, we deploy a parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder (PAMIE), which incorporates several depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a skip-connection way. Remarkably, we fine-tune the frozen SAM encoder under prompt-free conditions, where the DPA utilizes depth cues to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal features. Secondly, we deploy a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module, which unifies the memory bank and prompt embeddings into a learnable pipeline. Concretely, by leveraging both frame-level queries and video-level queries simultaneously, the QTM module can not only selectively extract temporal consistency features but also iteratively update the temporal representations of the queries. Extensive experiments are conducted on three RGB-D VSOD datasets, and the results show that the proposed SAM-DAQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of all evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to generate a complete semantic scene from an incomplete input. Existing approaches often employ dense network architectures with a high parameter count, leading to increased model complexity and resource demands. To address these limitations, we propose RWKV-PCSSC, a lightweight point cloud semantic scene completion network inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) mechanism. Specifically, we introduce a RWKV Seed Generator (RWKV-SG) module that can aggregate features from a partial point cloud to produce a coarse point cloud with coarse features. Subsequently, the point-wise feature of the point cloud is progressively restored through multiple stages of the RWKV Point Deconvolution (RWKV-PD) modules. By leveraging a compact and efficient design, our method achieves a lightweight model representation. Experimental results demonstrate that RWKV-PCSSC reduces the parameter count by 4.18$\times$ and improves memory efficiency by 1.37$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art methods PointSSC. Furthermore, our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on established indoor (SSC-PC, NYUCAD-PC) and outdoor (PointSSC) scene dataset, as well as on our proposed datasets (NYUCAD-PC-V2, 3D-FRONT-PC).

Motivation: 现有3D-VLMs直接将点云嵌入为3D token，在LLM部分处理所有3D token会产生巨大计算成本，限制了应用。需要找到减少3D token计算开销同时保持关键信息完整性的方法。

Method: 提出分层补偿压缩(HCC-3D)：1) 全局结构压缩(GSC)：设计全局查询将3D token压缩为少量关键token；2) 自适应细节挖掘(ADM)：选择性重新压缩显著但关注不足的特征，通过互补评分补偿GSC的信息损失。

Conclusion: HCC-3D通过分层补偿压缩策略有效解决了3D-VLMs的计算瓶颈问题，在保持信息完整性的同时大幅提升效率，为3D多模态理解提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D understanding has drawn significant attention recently, leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable multi-modal reasoning between point cloud and text data. Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HCC-3D not only achieves extreme compression ratios (approximately 98%) compared to previous 3D-VLMs, but also achieves new state-of-the-art performance, showing the great improvements on both efficiency and performance.

<details>

Motivation: 现代检测器在航拍图像小目标检测上表现不佳，主要原因是小目标特征有限且在网络传播中容易退化，以及小目标在训练中受到不成比例的回归惩罚

Method: 提出Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) 使用跨尺度空间通道注意力增强特征，以及Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) 动态调整损失权重以关注小目标

Result: 在AI-TOD、DOTA-v2.0和VisDrone2019基准测试中，将YOLOv5和YOLOx的AP提升5.5%，在AI-TOD-v2.0噪声数据集上达到29.0% AP

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效提升小目标检测性能，具有良好的泛化能力和鲁棒性

Abstract: Recently, despite the remarkable advancements in object detection, modern detectors still struggle to detect tiny objects in aerial images. One key reason is that tiny objects carry limited features that are inevitably degraded or lost during long-distance network propagation. Another is that smaller objects receive disproportionately greater regression penalties than larger ones during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and a Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) for tiny object detection, both of which are seamlessly compatible with the top-performing frameworks. Specifically, SARL employs a cross-scale spatial-channel attention to progressively enrich the meaningful features of each layer and strengthen the cross-layer feature sharing. SAL reshapes the vanilla IoU-based losses so as to dynamically assign lower weights to larger objects. This loss is able to focus training on tiny objects while reducing the influence on large objects. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmarks (\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD, DOTA-v2.0 and VisDrone2019), and the results demonstrate that the proposed method boosts the generalization ability by 5.5\% Average Precision (AP) when embedded in YOLOv5 (anchor-based) and YOLOx (anchor-free) baselines. Moreover, it also promotes the robust performance with 29.0\% AP on the real-world noisy dataset (\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD-v2.0).

Abstract: Automated medical image captioning translates complex radiological images into diagnostic narratives that can support reporting workflows. We present a Swin-BART encoder-decoder system with a lightweight regional attention module that amplifies diagnostically salient regions before cross-attention. Trained and evaluated on ROCO, our model achieves state-of-the-art semantic fidelity while remaining compact and interpretable. We report results as mean$\pm$std over three seeds and include $95\%$ confidence intervals. Compared with baselines, our approach improves ROUGE (proposed 0.603, ResNet-CNN 0.356, BLIP2-OPT 0.255) and BERTScore (proposed 0.807, BLIP2-OPT 0.645, ResNet-CNN 0.623), with competitive BLEU, CIDEr, and METEOR. We further provide ablations (regional attention on/off and token-count sweep), per-modality analysis (CT/MRI/X-ray), paired significance tests, and qualitative heatmaps that visualize the regions driving each description. Decoding uses beam search (beam size $=4$), length penalty $=1.1$, $no\_repeat\_ngram\_size$ $=3$, and max length $=128$. The proposed design yields accurate, clinically phrased captions and transparent regional attributions, supporting safe research use with a human in the loop.

Conclusion: 通过捕捉渐进跨域特征演化和动态调节适应路径，该方法能够弥合源域-未知域分布差距，显著增强对未见域偏移的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection (Single-DGOD), aiming to transfer a detector trained on one source domain to multiple unknown domains. Existing methods for Single-DGOD typically rely on discrete data augmentation or static perturbation methods to expand data diversity, thereby mitigating the lack of access to target domain data. However, in real-world scenarios such as changes in weather or lighting conditions, domain shifts often occur continuously and gradually. Discrete augmentations and static perturbations fail to effectively capture the dynamic variation of feature distributions, thereby limiting the model's ability to perceive fine-grained cross-domain differences. To this end, we propose a new method, Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution, which simulates the progressive evolution of features from the source domain to simulated latent distributions by incorporating temporal modeling and liquid neural network-driven parameter adjustment. Specifically, we introduce controllable Gaussian noise injection and multi-scale Gaussian blurring to simulate initial feature perturbations, followed by temporal modeling and a liquid parameter adjustment mechanism to generate adaptive modulation parameters, enabling a smooth and continuous adaptation across domains. By capturing progressive cross-domain feature evolution and dynamically regulating adaptation paths, our method bridges the source-unknown domain distribution gap, significantly boosting generalization and robustness to unseen shifts. Significant performance improvements on the Diverse Weather dataset and Real-to-Art benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/2490o/LTFE.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capabilities are inadequately assessed by existing benchmarks, which are predominantly English-centric, feature simplistic layouts, and support limited tasks. Consequently, they fail to evaluate model performance for Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU), a critical challenge involving complex layouts and dense text. To address this, we introduce DocWeaver, a novel multi-agent pipeline that leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate a new benchmark. The result is MosaicDoc, a large-scale, bilingual (Chinese and English) resource designed to push the boundaries of VRDU. Sourced from newspapers and magazines, MosaicDoc features diverse and complex layouts (including multi-column and non-Manhattan), rich stylistic variety from 196 publishers, and comprehensive multi-task annotations (OCR, VQA, reading order, and localization). With 72K images and over 600K QA pairs, MosaicDoc serves as a definitive benchmark for the field. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark reveals their current limitations in handling real-world document complexity and charts a clear path for future research.

Result: 在标准CIL基准测试中，SLDC显著提升了SeqFT性能，结合KD后达到与联合训练相当的效果。

Conclusion: SLDC通过补偿分布漂移，使SeqFT在类增量学习中表现优异，接近联合训练的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that sequential fine-tuning (SeqFT) of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs), followed by classifier refinement using approximate distributions of class features, can be an effective strategy for class-incremental learning (CIL). However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了行人重识别对抗防御中的模型偏差和复合泛化需求问题，为度量学习任务的对抗鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) is a fundamental task in many real-world applications such as pedestrian trajectory tracking. However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier. Additionally, we introduce an adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism to achieve dual-generalization for both unseen identities and unseen attack types. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses.

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer a new direction for advancements in vision architectures. While powerful, ViGs often face substantial computational challenges stemming from their graph construction phase, which can hinder their efficiency. To address this issue we propose AdaptViG, an efficient and powerful hybrid Vision GNN that introduces a novel graph construction mechanism called Adaptive Graph Convolution. This mechanism builds upon a highly efficient static axial scaffold and a dynamic, content-aware gating strategy called Exponential Decay Gating. This gating mechanism selectively weighs long-range connections based on feature similarity. Furthermore, AdaptViG employs a hybrid strategy, utilizing our efficient gating mechanism in the early stages and a full Global Attention block in the final stage for maximum feature aggregation. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among Vision GNNs. For instance, our AdaptViG-M achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy, outperforming ViG-B by 0.3% while using 80% fewer parameters and 84% fewer GMACs. On downstream tasks, AdaptViG-M obtains 45.8 mIoU, 44.8 APbox, and 41.1 APmask, surpassing the much larger EfficientFormer-L7 by 0.7 mIoU, 2.2 APbox, and 2.1 APmask, respectively, with 78% fewer parameters.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在速度-质量权衡方面表现良好，但在重建半透明表面时存在困难，因为大多数方法假设每个像素只有一个深度，当多个表面可见时会失效。

Method: 提出TSPE-GS方法，通过均匀采样透射率建模像素级多模态不透明度和深度分布，替代先前的单峰假设；通过逐步融合截断符号距离函数，在统一框架内分别重建外部和内部表面。

Conclusion: TSPE-GS能够泛化到其他基于高斯的重建流程，无需额外训练开销，有效解决了半透明表面重建中的交叉表面深度模糊问题。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting offers a strong speed-quality trade-off but struggles to reconstruct semi-transparent surfaces because most methods assume a single depth per pixel, which fails when multiple surfaces are visible. We propose TSPE-GS (Transparent Surface Probabilistic Extraction for Gaussian Splatting), which uniformly samples transmittance to model a pixel-wise multi-modal distribution of opacity and depth, replacing the prior single-peak assumption and resolving cross-surface depth ambiguity. By progressively fusing truncated signed distance functions, TSPE-GS reconstructs external and internal surfaces separately within a unified framework. The method generalizes to other Gaussian-based reconstruction pipelines without extra training overhead. Extensive experiments on public and self-collected semi-transparent and opaque datasets show TSPE-GS significantly improves semi-transparent geometry reconstruction while maintaining performance on opaque scenes.

Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的NR-IQA方法仅使用语义相似度（余弦相似度），忽略了CLIP图像特征幅度与感知质量之间的强相关性。

Method: 提取CLIP图像特征的绝对值，应用Box-Cox变换进行统计归一化，得到语义归一化的辅助线索；设计置信度引导的融合方案，自适应加权两个线索。

Conclusion: CLIP图像特征的幅度信息是感知质量评估的重要线索，与语义相似度互补，自适应融合框架能有效提升NR-IQA性能。

Abstract: Recent efforts have repurposed the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) by measuring the cosine similarity between the image embedding and textual prompts such as "a good photo" or "a bad photo." However, this semantic similarity overlooks a critical yet underexplored cue: the magnitude of the CLIP image features, which we empirically find to exhibit a strong correlation with perceptual quality. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines, without any task-specific training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型（特别是视觉语言模型）在自动驾驶等应用中提供了有吸引力的零样本目标检测能力，但由于检测延迟和幻觉预测问题，不适合直接部署。手动标注成本过高，需要自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models, especially vision-language models (VLMs), offer compelling zero-shot object detection for applications like autonomous driving, a domain where manual labelling is prohibitively expensive. However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms a baseline YOLOv5m model, achieving a significant mAP@0.5 boost ($31.12\%$ to $46.61\%$) while maintaining real-time detection latency. Furthermore, we show that supplementing our pseudo-labelled data with a small fraction of ground truth labels ($10\%$) leads to further performance gains, reaching $57.97\%$ mAP@0.5 on the KITTI dataset. We observe similar performance improvements for the ACDC and BDD100k datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models, especially diffusion models, have significantly improved image restoration (IR) performance. However, existing problem-agnostic diffusion model-based image restoration (DMIR) methods face challenges in fully leveraging diffusion priors, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we address the limitations of current problem-agnostic DMIR methods by analyzing their sampling process and providing effective solutions. We introduce EquS, a DMIR method that imposes equivariant information through dual sampling trajectories. To further boost EquS, we propose the Timestep-Aware Schedule (TAS) and introduce EquS$^+$. TAS prioritizes deterministic steps to enhance certainty and sampling efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method is compatible with previous problem-agnostic DMIR methods and significantly boosts their performance without increasing computational costs.

TL;DR: 提出DiVE方法，通过约束预训练模型和微调模型嵌入之间的差异向量来保持几何结构，从而在ID数据上鲁棒微调视觉语言模型，同时不损害OOD和零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒微调方法在重用对比学习时会扭曲嵌入的几何结构，这限制了模型在OOD和零样本设置下的泛化能力。

Method: 提出差异向量均衡化(DiVE)，通过平均向量损失(AVL)和成对向量损失(PVL)来约束差异向量，分别从全局和局部保持几何结构。

Result: 实验表明DiVE有效保持了几何结构，在ID、OOD和零样本指标上都取得了强劲结果。

Conclusion: DiVE方法通过保持嵌入几何结构，成功实现了在ID数据上鲁棒微调的同时保持OOD和零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Contrastive pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, demonstrate strong generalization abilities in zero-shot classification by leveraging embeddings extracted from image and text encoders. This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics.

Motivation: 现有场景文本编辑方法存在对低资源语言支持不足、合成数据与真实数据之间存在领域差距、以及缺乏合适的文本样式保持评估指标等问题。

Method: 使用语言自适应字形编码器实现可靠的多语言编辑，采用多阶段训练策略（先在合成数据上预训练，然后在真实图像上微调），并构建了新的STIPLAR数据集。

Conclusion: STELLAR通过创新的训练策略和评估方法，有效解决了场景文本编辑中的多语言支持和真实数据适应挑战。

Abstract: Scene Text Editing (STE) is the task of modifying text content in an image while preserving its visual style, such as font, color, and background. While recent diffusion-based approaches have shown improvements in visual quality, key limitations remain: lack of support for low-resource languages, domain gap between synthetic and real data, and the absence of appropriate metrics for evaluating text style preservation. To address these challenges, we propose STELLAR (Scene Text Editor for Low-resource LAnguages and Real-world data). STELLAR enables reliable multilingual editing through a language-adaptive glyph encoder and a multi-stage training strategy that first pre-trains on synthetic data and then fine-tunes on real images. We also construct a new dataset, STIPLAR(Scene Text Image Pairs of Low-resource lAnguages and Real-world data), for training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose Text Appearance Similarity (TAS), a novel metric that assesses style preservation by independently measuring font, color, and background similarity, enabling robust evaluation even without ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that STELLAR outperforms state-of-the-art models in visual consistency and recognition accuracy, achieving an average TAS improvement of 2.2% across languages over the baselines.

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了一类新的物理可实现威胁，强调迫切需要开发考虑真实环境中材料级属性的防御机制。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detection is widely used in safety-critical systems. However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%. Our work reveals a new class of physically realizable threats and underscores the urgent need for defenses that account for material-level properties in real-world environments.

Abstract: Weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation is essential for 3D scene understanding, especially as the growing scale of data and high annotation costs associated with fully supervised approaches. Existing methods primarily rely on two forms of weak supervision: one-thing-one-click annotations and bounding box annotations, both of which aim to reduce labeling efforts. However, these approaches still encounter limitations, including labor-intensive annotation processes, high complexity, and reliance on expert annotators. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{DBGroup}, a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that leverages scene-level annotations as a more efficient and scalable alternative. In the first stage, we introduce a Dual-Branch Point Grouping module to generate pseudo labels guided by semantic and mask cues extracted from multi-view images. To further improve label quality, we develop two refinement strategies: Granularity-Aware Instance Merging and Semantic Selection and Propagation. The second stage involves multi-round self-training on an end-to-end instance segmentation network using the refined pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce an Instance Mask Filter strategy to address inconsistencies within the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBGroup achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods, while surpassing state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

Conclusion: LampQ通过克服现有混合精度量化方法的三个主要限制，为Vision Transformer提供了准确且高效的量化解决方案。

Abstract: How can we accurately quantize a pre-trained Vision Transformer model? Quantization algorithms compress Vision Transformers (ViTs) into low-bit formats, reducing memory and computation demands with minimal accuracy degradation. However, existing methods rely on uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of ViT components to quantization. Metric-based Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) is a promising alternative, but previous MPQ methods for ViTs suffer from three major limitations: 1) coarse granularity, 2) mismatch in metric scale across component types, and 3) quantization-unaware bit allocation. In this paper, we propose LampQ (Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers), an accurate metric-based MPQ method for ViTs to overcome these limitations. LampQ performs layer-wise quantization to achieve both fine-grained control and efficient acceleration, incorporating a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. Then, LampQ assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming and further updates them iteratively. Extensive experiments show that LampQ provides the state-of-the-art performance in quantizing ViTs pre-trained on various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and zero-shot quantization.

Abstract: Automated interpretation of medical images demands robust modeling of complex visual-semantic relationships while addressing annotation scarcity, label imbalance, and clinical plausibility constraints. We introduce MIRNet (Medical Image Reasoner Network), a novel framework that integrates self-supervised pre-training with constrained graph-based reasoning. Tongue image diagnosis is a particularly challenging domain that requires fine-grained visual and semantic understanding. Our approach leverages self-supervised masked autoencoder (MAE) to learn transferable visual representations from unlabeled data; employs graph attention networks (GAT) to model label correlations through expert-defined structured graphs; enforces clinical priors via constraint-aware optimization using KL divergence and regularization losses; and mitigates imbalance using asymmetric loss (ASL) and boosting ensembles. To address annotation scarcity, we also introduce TongueAtlas-4K, a comprehensive expert-curated benchmark comprising 4,000 images annotated with 22 diagnostic labels--representing the largest public dataset in tongue analysis. Validation shows our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. While optimized for tongue diagnosis, the framework readily generalizes to broader diagnostic medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Effective human-agent collaboration in physical environments requires understanding not only what to act upon, but also where the actionable elements are and how to interact with them. Existing approaches often operate at the object level or disjointedly handle fine-grained affordance reasoning, lacking coherent, instruction-driven grounding and reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new task: Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, which requires an agent to predict, for each referenced affordance element in a 3D scene, a structured triplet comprising its spatial location, motion type, and motion axis, based on a task instruction. To solve this task, we propose AffordBot, a novel framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a tailored chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm. To bridge the gap between 3D input and 2D-compatible MLLMs, we render surround-view images of the scene and project 3D element candidates into these views, forming a rich visual representation aligned with the scene geometry. Our CoT pipeline begins with an active perception stage, prompting the MLLM to select the most informative viewpoint based on the instruction, before proceeding with step-by-step reasoning to localize affordance elements and infer plausible interaction motions. Evaluated on the SceneFun3D dataset, AffordBot achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong generalization and physically grounded reasoning with only 3D point cloud input and MLLMs.

Abstract: We propose Anomagic, a zero-shot anomaly generation method that produces semantically coherent anomalies without requiring any exemplar anomalies. By unifying both visual and textual cues through a crossmodal prompt encoding scheme, Anomagic leverages rich contextual information to steer an inpainting-based generation pipeline. A subsequent contrastive refinement strategy enforces precise alignment between synthesized anomalies and their masks, thereby bolstering downstream anomaly detection accuracy. To facilitate training, we introduce AnomVerse, a collection of 12,987 anomaly-mask-caption triplets assembled from 13 publicly available datasets, where captions are automatically generated by multimodal large language models using structured visual prompts and template-based textual hints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomagic trained on AnomVerse can synthesize more realistic and varied anomalies than prior methods, yielding superior improvements in downstream anomaly detection. Furthermore, Anomagic can generate anomalies for any normal-category image using user-defined prompts, establishing a versatile foundation model for anomaly generation.

Conclusion: DGFusion通过双引导范式有效解决了单引导范式在困难实例检测上的局限性，为自动驾驶感知系统提供了更可靠的3D物体检测能力。

Abstract: As a critical task in autonomous driving perception systems, 3D object detection is used to identify and track key objects, such as vehicles and pedestrians. However, detecting distant, small, or occluded objects (hard instances) remains a challenge, which directly compromises the safety of autonomous driving systems. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\% mAP, +0.8\% NDS, and +1.3\% average recall on nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent robustness gains for hard instance detection across ego-distance, size, visibility, and small-scale training scenarios.

Conclusion: 基于UDF的LoG架构为复杂3D内容生成提供了鲁棒高效的解决方案，突破了传统方法在分辨率和非流形几何处理上的限制

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D contents remains a fundamental challenge due to the complexity of representing arbitrary topologies-such as open surfaces and intricate internal structures-while preserving geometric details. Prevailing methods based on signed distance fields (SDFs) are hampered by costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations often suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) framework built upon unsigned distance fields (UDFs)-a more robust and computationally efficient representation that naturally handles complex and incomplete shapes. Our core innovation is a local-to-global (LoG) architecture that processes the UDF by partitioning it into uniform subvolumes, termed UBlocks. This architecture couples 3D convolutions for capturing local detail with sparse transformers for enforcing global coherence. A Pad-Average strategy further ensures smooth transitions at subvolume boundaries during reconstruction. This modular design enables seamless scaling to ultra-high resolutions up to 2048^3-a regime previously unattainable for 3D VAEs. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction accuracy and generative quality, yielding superior surface smoothness and geometric flexibility.

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection has gained sufficient attention due to its detection performance in low light, fog, and rain conditions. However, visible and infrared modalities captured by different sensors exist the information imbalance problem in complex scenarios, which can cause inadequate cross-modal fusion, resulting in degraded detection performance. \textcolor{red}{Furthermore, most existing methods use transformers in the spatial domain to capture complementary features, ignoring the advantages of developing frequency domain transformers to mine complementary information.} To solve these weaknesses, we propose a frequency domain fusion transformer, called FreDFT, for visible-infrared object detection. The proposed approach employs a novel multimodal frequency domain attention (MFDA) to mine complementary information between modalities and a frequency domain feed-forward layer (FDFFL) via a mixed-scale frequency feature fusion strategy is designed to better enhance multimodal features. To eliminate the imbalance of multimodal information, a cross-modal global modeling module (CGMM) is constructed to perform pixel-wise inter-modal feature interaction in a spatial and channel manner.

*Xurui Li,Feng Xue,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MuSc-V2框架，通过利用正常图像补丁在2D外观和3D形状上的相似性特征，实现了零样本异常分类和分割，在多个数据集上显著超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了关键特性：工业产品中的正常图像补丁通常在2D外观和3D形状上都能找到许多相似补丁，而异常则保持多样性和孤立性。

Method: 采用相互评分框架，包括迭代点分组改进3D表示、相似性邻域聚合融合2D/3D特征、相互评分机制和跨模态异常增强，最后通过约束邻域重新评分。

Result: 在MVTec 3D-AD数据集上获得+23.7% AP提升，在Eyecandies数据集上获得+19.3%提升，超越了之前的零样本基准方法，甚至优于大多数少样本方法。

Conclusion: MuSc-V2框架能够灵活支持单模态或多模态处理，在不同产品线上保持一致的鲁棒性能，为零样本异常检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) methods aim to identify and outline defects without using any labeled samples. In this paper, we reveal a key property that is overlooked by existing methods: normal image patches across industrial products typically find many other similar patches, not only in 2D appearance but also in 3D shapes, while anomalies remain diverse and isolated. To explicitly leverage this discriminative property, we propose a Mutual Scoring framework (MuSc-V2) for zero-shot AC/AS, which flexibly supports single 2D/3D or multimodality. Specifically, our method begins by improving 3D representation through Iterative Point Grouping (IPG), which reduces false positives from discontinuous surfaces. Then we use Similarity Neighborhood Aggregation with Multi-Degrees (SNAMD) to fuse 2D/3D neighborhood cues into more discriminative multi-scale patch features for mutual scoring. The core comprises a Mutual Scoring Mechanism (MSM) that lets samples within each modality to assign score to each other, and Cross-modal Anomaly Enhancement (CAE) that fuses 2D and 3D scores to recover modality-specific missing anomalies. Finally, Re-scoring with Constrained Neighborhood (RsCon) suppresses false classification based on similarity to more representative samples. Our framework flexibly works on both the full dataset and smaller subsets with consistently robust performance, ensuring seamless adaptability across diverse product lines. In aid of the novel framework, MuSc-V2 achieves significant performance improvements: a $\textbf{+23.7\%}$ AP gain on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and a $\textbf{+19.3\%}$ boost on the Eyecandies dataset, surpassing previous zero-shot benchmarks and even outperforming most few-shot methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像筛选研究稀少，多模态大语言模型在图像美学推理方面表现不佳，主要由于缺乏数据和模型推理能力弱。

Method: 收集了包含128k样本的全面数据集，评估四个美学方面；提出了HCM-GRPO方法，在GRPO框架中引入硬例挖掘策略和动态比例准确度奖励。

Result: 实验显示即使最先进的闭源MLLMs在图像美学推理上表现接近随机猜测，而HCM-GRPO方法使小模型超越了大型开源和领先闭源模型。

Conclusion: 通过构建全面数据集和开发HCM-GRPO方法，成功解决了MLLMs在图像美学推理方面的不足，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: The performance of image generation has been significantly improved in recent years. However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning. In contrast, by leveraging the HCM-GRPO, we are able to surpass the scores of both large-scale open-source and leading closed-source models with a much smaller model.

Motivation: 研究多模态大语言模型能否识别视觉存在但音频缺失的混淆对象，解决MLLMs在音频-视觉推理中视觉主导导致的判断偏差问题。

Method: 提出RL-CoMM方法，包含两个阶段：1）引入大型音频语言模型作为参考模型生成纯音频推理，设计逐步推理奖励函数让MLLMs自我改进；2）引入答案中心置信度优化来减少异构推理差异的不确定性。

Result: 在音频-视觉问答和音频-视觉幻觉任务上的实验表明，RL-CoMM在有限训练数据下比基线模型准确率提高了10~30%。

Conclusion: RL-CoMM有效解决了MLLMs在音频-视觉混淆场景下的视觉主导问题，显著提升了模型的音频-视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) discern confused objects that are visually present but audio-absent? To study this, we introduce a new benchmark, AV-ConfuseBench, which simulates an ``Audio-Visual Confusion'' scene by modifying the corresponding sound of an object in the video, e.g., mute the sounding object and ask MLLMs Is there a/an muted-object sound''. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences. Extensive experiments on audio-visual question answering and audio-visual hallucination show that RL-CoMM improves the accuracy by 10~30\% over the baseline model with limited training data.

Motivation: 医疗视觉中的细粒度动作评估面临数据集缺乏、精度要求严格、快速动作时空动态建模不足等挑战。

Method: 多元高斯表示将关节运动投影到时间缩放的多维空间，将动作分解为自适应3D高斯作为token；混合空间编码采用笛卡尔和向量双流策略利用骨骼信息。

Result: 在CPREval-6k数据集上达到92.1% Top-1准确率，比ST-GCN基线提升5.9%，仅需10% FLOPs；跨数据集实验证实了方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GaussMedAct框架通过自适应时空表示学习有效推进了医疗动作分析，在精度和效率方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Fine-grained action evaluation in medical vision faces unique challenges due to the unavailability of comprehensive datasets, stringent precision requirements, and insufficient spatiotemporal dynamic modeling of very rapid actions. To support development and evaluation, we introduce CPREval-6k, a multi-view, multi-label medical action benchmark containing 6,372 expert-annotated videos with 22 clinical labels. Using this dataset, we present GaussMedAct, a multivariate Gaussian encoding framework, to advance medical motion analysis through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning. Multivariate Gaussian Representation projects the joint motions to a temporally scaled multi-dimensional space, and decomposes actions into adaptive 3D Gaussians that serve as tokens. These tokens preserve motion semantics through anisotropic covariance modeling while maintaining robustness to spatiotemporal noise. Hybrid Spatial Encoding, employing a Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy, effectively utilizes skeletal information in the form of joint and bone features. The proposed method achieves 92.1% Top-1 accuracy with real-time inference on the benchmark, outperforming the ST-GCN baseline by +5.9% accuracy with only 10% FLOPs. Cross-dataset experiments confirm the superiority of our method in robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在高光谱图像分类中过度依赖置信度，导致确认偏误，特别是在稀疏标注或类别不平衡情况下，模型容易对自信的错误预测过度拟合。

Method: 提出CABIN框架：1）感知阶段估计认知不确定性识别模糊区域；2）行动阶段采用不确定性引导的双重采样策略；3）纠正阶段引入细粒度动态分配策略对伪标签数据分类处理。

Result: 实验表明多种先进方法在集成CABIN后都获得了性能提升，提高了标注效率和分类性能。

Conclusion: CABIN通过认知感知的行为学习机制有效解决了置信度误导问题，提升了半监督高光谱图像分类的泛化能力。

Abstract: Confidence alone is often misleading in hyperspectral image classification, as models tend to mistake high predictive scores for correctness while lacking awareness of uncertainty. This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias. To correct noisy supervision, CABIN introduces a Fine-Grained Dynamic Assignment Strategy that categorizes pseudo-labeled data into reliable, ambiguous, and noisy subsets, applying tailored losses to enhance generalization. Experimental results show that a wide range of state-of-the-art methods benefit from the integration of CABIN, with improved labeling efficiency and performance.

*Gwangyeon Ahn,Jiwan Seo,Joonhyuk Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLF-MSC是一种基于视觉语言特征的多模态语义通信系统，通过传输单一紧凑的视觉语言表示，在接收端同时支持图像和文本生成，提高频谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义通信技术分别处理每种模态，需要特定模态流或重传，导致频谱效率低。需要一种统一的多模态语义通信方法。

Method: 使用预训练视觉语言模型将源图像编码为视觉语言语义特征(VLF)，通过无线信道传输。接收端基于VLF分别使用解码器语言模型和扩散图像生成器生成描述文本和语义对齐图像。

Result: 实验表明VLF-MSC在低信噪比下优于仅文本和仅图像基线，对两种模态都实现更高的语义准确性，同时显著减少带宽需求。

Conclusion: VLF-MSC通过统一的视觉语言表示实现了高效的多模态语义通信，利用基础模型在保持语义保真度的同时提高对信道噪声的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose Vision-Language Feature-based Multimodal Semantic Communication (VLF-MSC), a unified system that transmits a single compact vision-language representation to support both image and text generation at the receiver. Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image. This unified representation eliminates the need for modality-specific streams or retransmissions, improving spectral efficiency and adaptability. By leveraging foundation models, the system achieves robustness to channel noise while preserving semantic fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that VLF-MSC outperforms text-only and image-only baselines, achieving higher semantic accuracy for both modalities under low SNR with significantly reduced bandwidth.

Motivation: 现有生成方法通常在局部关节旋转上操作，这些旋转基于骨架结构分层定义，导致生成过程中出现累积误差，表现为末端效应器的不稳定和不合理运动。

Method: 提出GlobalDiff扩散框架，直接在全局关节旋转空间操作；引入多级约束方案：关节结构约束、骨架结构约束和时间结构约束，共同正则化全局扩散过程。

Result: 在标准共语音基准测试上的广泛评估显示，GlobalDiff生成平滑准确的动作，在多个说话者身份下比当前SOTA性能提升46.0%。

Conclusion: 全局旋转空间操作结合多级约束能有效解耦关节预测依赖关系，减轻分层误差累积，显著提升共语音动作生成的可靠性和质量。

Abstract: Reliable co-speech motion generation requires precise motion representation and consistent structural priors across all joints. Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness. Extensive evaluations on standard co-speech benchmarks show that GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, improving the performance by 46.0 % compared to the current SOTA under multiple speaker identities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GridPrune是一种视觉token剪枝方法，采用"全局引导、局部选择"的分区选择系统，通过两阶段策略提高多模态大语言模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法主要关注"选择什么"，忽略了"看哪里"的空间分配问题，导致效率低下、位置偏差和冗余token保留。受人类视觉系统启发，需要先确定关注区域再进行细粒度选择。

Method: 将剪枝过程分为两步：首先使用文本条件引导动态分配token预算到空间区域，然后在每个预算区域内进行局部选择，取代全局Top-K机制。

Result: 在LLaVA-NeXT-7B上，GridPrune仅使用11.1%的token就能保持96.98%的完整性能，在相同剪枝率下比最佳基线方法性能提升2.34%。

Conclusion: GridPrune通过模拟人类视觉系统的两阶段策略，有效解决了现有剪枝方法的空间分配问题，在各种MLLM架构上实现了优越性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to ("where to look") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail ("what to select"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing "what to select", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider "where to look", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a "guide-globally, select-locally" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPrune achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of the full performance while using 11.1% of the tokens, outperforming the best-performing baseline by 2.34% at the same pruning rate.

Conclusion: SUGAR框架成功地将LLMs与骨架数据结合，通过视觉运动知识监督实现了有效的动作识别和描述

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold rich implicit knowledge and powerful transferability. In this paper, we explore the combination of LLMs with the human skeleton to perform action classification and description. However, when treating LLM as a recognizer, two questions arise: 1) How can LLMs understand skeleton? 2) How can LLMs distinguish among actions? To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions. Notably, we present a Temporal Query Projection (TQP) module to continuously model the skeleton signals with long sequences. Experiments on several skeleton-based action classification benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our SUGAR. Moreover, experiments on zero-shot scenarios show that SUGAR is more versatile than linear-based methods.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LVLMs对多目标后门攻击的脆弱性，强调了缓解此类威胁的紧迫需求。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various vision-language tasks by leveraging large-scale image-text pretraining and instruction tuning. However, the security vulnerabilities of LVLMs have become increasingly concerning, particularly their susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks focus on single-target attacks, i.e., targeting a single malicious output associated with a specific trigger. In this work, we uncover multi-target backdoor attacks, where multiple independent triggers corresponding to different attack targets are added in a single pass of training, posing a greater threat to LVLMs in real-world applications. Executing such attacks in LVLMs is challenging since there can be many incorrect trigger-target mappings due to severe feature interference among different triggers. To address this challenge, we propose MTAttack, the first multi-target backdoor attack framework for enforcing accurate multiple trigger-target mappings in LVLMs. The core of MTAttack is a novel optimization method with two constraints, namely Proxy Space Partitioning constraint and Trigger Prototype Anchoring constraint. It jointly optimizes multiple triggers in the latent space, with each trigger independently mapping clean images to a unique proxy class while at the same time guaranteeing their separability. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate a high success rate of MTAttack for multi-target attacks, substantially outperforming existing attack methods. Furthermore, our attack exhibits strong generalizability across datasets and robustness against backdoor defense strategies. These findings highlight the vulnerability of LVLMs to multi-target backdoor attacks and underscore the urgent need for mitigating such threats.

Result: 在动态目标域上实现了优越的适应性能，同时保持计算效率

Conclusion: RobIA框架能够有效应对持续领域偏移，提供输入特定的灵活性和广泛的监督覆盖，提升领域偏移下的泛化能力

Abstract: Stereo Depth Estimation in real-world environments poses significant challenges due to dynamic domain shifts, sparse or unreliable supervision, and the high cost of acquiring dense ground-truth labels. While recent Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods offer promising solutions, most rely on static target domain assumptions and input-invariant adaptation strategies, limiting their effectiveness under continual shifts. In this paper, we propose RobIA, a novel Robust, Instance-Aware framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in stereo depth estimation. RobIA integrates two key components: (1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE), a parameter-efficient module that dynamically routes input to frozen experts via lightweight self-attention mechanism tailored to epipolar geometry, and (2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher, a PEFT-based teacher model that provides dense pseudo-supervision by complementing sparse handcrafted labels. This strategy enables input-specific flexibility, broad supervision coverage, improving generalization under domain shift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobIA achieves superior adaptation performance across dynamic target domains while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: CACMI通过显式建模视频的时序特性和语言语义，有效解决了现有方法在时序连贯性和语义完整性方面的不足，为密集视频描述提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Dense video captioning jointly localizes and captions salient events in untrimmed videos. Recent methods primarily focus on leveraging additional prior knowledge and advanced multi-task architectures to achieve competitive performance. However, these pipelines rely on implicit modeling that uses frame-level or fragmented video features, failing to capture the temporal coherence across event sequences and comprehensive semantics within visual contexts. To address this, we propose an explicit temporal-semantic modeling framework called Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI), which leverages both latent temporal characteristics within videos and linguistic semantics from text corpus. Specifically, our model consists of two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent, event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval; and Context-aware Feature Enhancement utilizes query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics. Extensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets demonstrate that CACMI achieves the state-of-the-art performance on dense video captioning task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查当今领先文本到图像模型在逻辑组合方面的根本缺陷，特别是分析否定、计数和空间关系三个核心原语上的性能崩溃问题。

Method: 通过分析训练数据、注意力架构和评估指标三个关键因素，调查模型在单个原语和组合原语上的性能表现。

Result: 模型在单个原语上准确，但在组合时性能急剧下降，显示出严重干扰。训练数据缺乏明确否定，连续注意力架构不适合离散逻辑，评估指标偏向视觉合理性而非约束满足。

Conclusion: 实现真正的组合性需要表示和推理方面的根本性进步，而非对现有架构的增量调整，简单的扩展无法弥合这一差距。

Abstract: The architectural blueprint of today's leading text-to-image models contains a fundamental flaw: an inability to handle logical composition. This survey investigates this breakdown across three core primitives-negation, counting, and spatial relations. Our analysis reveals a dramatic performance collapse: models that are accurate on single primitives fail precipitously when these are combined, exposing severe interference. We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap. Achieving genuine compositionality, we conclude, will require fundamental advances in representation and reasoning rather than incremental adjustments to existing architectures.

Result: 在2D图像拟合、2D CT重建、3D形状表示和5D新视角合成等多个任务中，split-layer显著提升了INR性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: split-layer通过高效扩展特征空间维度，显著增强了INR的表征能力，在各种逆问题任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) models signals as continuous functions using neural networks, offering efficient and differentiable optimization for inverse problems across diverse disciplines. However, the representational capacity of INR defined by the range of functions the neural network can characterize, is inherently limited by the low-dimensional feature space in conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures. While widening the MLP can linearly increase feature space dimensionality, it also leads to a quadratic growth in computational and memory costs. To address this limitation, we propose the split-layer, a novel reformulation of MLP construction. The split-layer divides each layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs via Hadamard product, effectively constructing a high-degree polynomial space. This approach significantly enhances INR's representational capacity by expanding the feature space dimensionality without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the split-layer substantially improves INR performance, surpassing existing methods across multiple tasks, including 2D image fitting, 2D CT reconstruction, 3D shape representation, and 5D novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: 提出的双机制协同优化框架有效解决了深度伪造检测中公平性与准确性之间的权衡问题，为可信AI部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Fairness is a core element in the trustworthy deployment of deepfake detection models, especially in the field of digital identity security. Biases in detection models toward different demographic groups, such as gender and race, may lead to systemic misjudgments, exacerbating the digital divide and social inequities. However, current fairness-enhanced detectors often improve fairness at the cost of detection accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-mechanism collaborative optimization framework. Our proposed method innovatively integrates structural fairness decoupling and global distribution alignment: decoupling channels sensitive to demographic groups at the model architectural level, and subsequently reducing the distance between the overall sample distribution and the distributions corresponding to each demographic group at the feature level. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with other methods, our framework improves both inter-group and intra-group fairness while maintaining overall detection accuracy across domains.

Motivation: 解决文本查询无法准确反映图像内容导致的跨模态对齐困难和过拟合问题，以及文本与图像之间的固有模态差距。

Method: GEA包含两个并行模块：文本引导的令牌增强(TGTE)使用扩散生成图像作为中间语义表示；生成中间融合(GIF)结合生成图像、原始图像和文本特征的交叉注意力生成统一表示。

Result: 在CUHK-PEDES、RSTPReid和ICFG-PEDES三个公开数据集上的实验证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 从生成视角提出的GEA方法能够有效缓解文本到图像行人检索中的模态差距问题，提升检索性能。

Abstract: Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) aims to retrieve person images based on natural language descriptions. Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了可解释的多退化图像恢复，在保持物理可解释性的同时提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Although image restoration has advanced significantly, most existing methods target only a single type of degradation. In real-world scenarios, images often contain multiple degradations simultaneously, such as rain, noise, and haze, requiring models capable of handling diverse degradation types. Moreover, methods that improve performance through module stacking often suffer from limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability-driven approach for multi-degradation image restoration, built upon a deep unfolding network that maps the iterative process of a mathematical optimization algorithm into a learnable network structure. Specifically, we employ an improved second-order semi-smooth Newton algorithm to ensure that each module maintains clear physical interpretability. To further enhance interpretability and adaptability, we design an explainable convolution module inspired by the human brain's flexible information processing and the intrinsic characteristics of images, allowing the network to flexibly leverage learned knowledge and autonomously adjust parameters for different input. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, named InterIR, demonstrates excellent performance in multi-degradation restoration while remaining highly competitive on single-degradation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate localization of cephalometric landmarks from 2D lateral skull X-rays is vital for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment. Manual annotation is time-consuming and error-prone, whereas automated approaches often struggle with low contrast and anatomical complexity. This paper introduces CephRes-MHNet, a multi-head residual convolutional network for robust and efficient cephalometric landmark detection. The architecture integrates residual encoding, dual-attention mechanisms, and multi-head decoders to enhance contextual reasoning and anatomical precision. Trained on the Aariz Cephalometric dataset of 1,000 radiographs, CephRes-MHNet achieved a mean radial error (MRE) of 1.23 mm and a success detection rate (SDR) @ 2.0 mm of 85.5%, outperforming all evaluated models. In particular, it exceeded the strongest baseline, the attention-driven AFPF-Net (MRE = 1.25 mm, SDR @ 2.0 mm = 84.1%), while using less than 25% of its parameters. These results demonstrate that CephRes-MHNet attains state-of-the-art accuracy through architectural efficiency, providing a practical solution for real-world orthodontic analysis.

Conclusion: VISTA生成具有社会合规性、目标感知性和可解释性的轨迹，对安全关键自主系统具有应用前景。

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous systems operating in dense, interactive environments. Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE. These results show that VISTA generates socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable trajectories, making it promising for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Conclusion: LiNeXt在实时场景补全方面展现出卓越的效率和效果，适用于自动驾驶感知系统

Abstract: 3D LiDAR scene completion from point clouds is a fundamental component of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. Previous methods have predominantly employed diffusion models for high-fidelity reconstruction. However, their multi-step iterative sampling incurs significant computational overhead, limiting its real-time applicability. To address this, we propose LiNeXt-a lightweight, non-diffusion network optimized for rapid and accurate point cloud completion. Specifically, LiNeXt first applies the Noise-to-Coarse (N2C) Module to denoise the input noisy point cloud in a single pass, thereby obviating the multi-step iterative sampling of diffusion-based methods. The Refine Module then takes the coarse point cloud and its intermediate features from the N2C Module to perform more precise refinement, further enhancing structural completeness. Furthermore, we observe that LiDAR point clouds exhibit a distance-dependent spatial distribution, being densely sampled at proximal ranges and sparsely sampled at distal ranges. Accordingly, we propose the Distance-aware Selected Repeat strategy to generate a more uniformly distributed noisy point cloud. On the SemanticKITTI dataset, LiNeXt achieves a 199.8x speedup in inference, reduces Chamfer Distance by 50.7%, and uses only 6.1% of the parameters compared with LiDiff. These results demonstrate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of LiNeXt for real-time scene completion.

Conclusion: HeatV2X框架通过有效的异构对齐和可扩展设计，在最小化训练成本的同时大幅提升协同感知性能，为V2X协同感知提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception extends sensing beyond single vehicle limits through transmission. However, as more agents participate, existing frameworks face two key challenges: (1) the participating agents are inherently multi-modal and heterogeneous, and (2) the collaborative framework must be scalable to accommodate new agents. The former requires effective cross-agent feature alignment to mitigate heterogeneity loss, while the latter renders full-parameter training impractical, highlighting the importance of scalable adaptation. To address these issues, we propose Heterogeneous Adaptation (HeatV2X), a scalable collaborative framework. We first train a high-performance agent based on heterogeneous graph attention as the foundation for collaborative learning. Then, we design Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning to achieve effective alignment and interaction among heterogeneous agents. The former efficiently extracts modality-specific differences using Hetero-Aware Adapters, while the latter employs the Multi-Cognitive Adapter to enhance cross-agent collaboration and fully exploit the fusion potential. These designs enable substantial performance improvement of the collaborative framework with minimal training cost. We evaluate our approach on the OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior perception performance with significantly reduced training overhead, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our implementation will be released soon.

Abstract: Recent multimodal deepfake detection methods designed for generalization conjecture that single-stage supervised training struggles to generalize across unseen manipulations and datasets. However, such approaches that target generalization require pretraining over real samples. Additionally, these methods primarily focus on detecting audio-visual inconsistencies and may overlook intra-modal artifacts causing them to fail against manipulations that preserve audio-visual alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage training framework that enhances generalization by incorporating next-frame prediction for both uni-modal and cross-modal features. Additionally, we introduce a window-level attention mechanism to capture discrepancies between predicted and actual frames, enabling the model to detect local artifacts around every frame, which is crucial for accurately classifying fully manipulated videos and effectively localizing deepfake segments in partially spoofed samples. Our model, evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrates strong generalization and precise temporal localization.

Conclusion: TubeRMC框架通过管状条件重建和相互约束机制，显著提升了弱监督时空视频定位的性能

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize a spatio-temporal tube that corresponds to a given language query in an untrimmed video. This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction. TubeRMC outperforms existing methods on two public benchmarks VidSTG and HCSTVG. Further visualization shows that TubeRMC effectively mitigates both target identification errors and inconsistent tracking.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate and score sports actions, which has attracted widespread interest in recent years. Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability. Meanwhile, existing AQA datasets also lack fine-grained annotations for action scores, especially for deduction items and sub-score annotations. In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy. Then, we propose a stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion module to boost the perception of stage-specific key regions and enhance the robustness to visual changes caused by frequent camera viewpoints switching. In addition, we propose a knowledge-based grade-aware decoder to incorporate possible deduction items as prior knowledge to predict more accurate and reliable scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Analysis (FEA) extends traditional facial emotion recognition by incorporating explainable, fine-grained reasoning. The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion. Third, we design a data synthesis pipeline that iteratively leverages the prior stages to expand the training dataset, enabling scalable self-improvement of the model. Built upon this framework, we introduce FEA-20K, a benchmark dataset comprising 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples with fine-grained emotion analysis annotations. Extensive experiments across eight standard benchmarks demonstrate that Facial-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in FEA, with strong generalization and robust interpretability.

Motivation: 现有的细粒度视觉分类方法通常依赖特征选择机制或区域提议策略来定位判别性区域，但这些方法往往无法全面捕捉判别性线索，同时引入大量类别无关的冗余信息。

Method: 提出H3Former框架，包含语义感知聚合模块(SAAM)和双曲层次对比损失(HHCL)。SAAM利用多尺度上下文线索动态构建token间的加权超图，通过超图卷积捕获高阶语义依赖关系；HHCL在非欧几里得嵌入空间中强制执行层次语义约束。

Conclusion: H3Former通过高阶语义关系聚合和层次对比学习，有效解决了细粒度视觉分类中的类间差异细微和类内变化大的挑战。

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) remains a challenging task due to subtle inter-class differences and large intra-class variations. Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of our H3Former framework.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在复杂视觉推理任务中面临多步依赖导致错误级联的问题，而传统方法要么依赖昂贵的步骤级标注，要么只能提供稀疏的结果级反馈。

Method: PROPA框架整合了蒙特卡洛树搜索与GRPO，生成密集的过程级奖励，并通过交错GRPO更新与监督微调来克服冷启动问题。还训练了一个过程奖励模型来指导推理时搜索。

Result: 在7个基准测试和4个VLM骨干网络上，PROPA始终优于基于SFT和RLVR的基线方法，在域内任务上提升达17.0%，在域外任务上提升达21.0%。

Conclusion: PROPA为视觉推理任务建立了强大的推理和泛化能力，是解决复杂多步视觉推理问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still struggle with complex visual reasoning, where multi-step dependencies cause early errors to cascade through the reasoning chain. Existing post-training paradigms are limited: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) relies on costly step-level annotations, while Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods like GRPO provide only sparse, outcome-level feedback, hindering stable optimization. We introduce PROPA (Process-level Reasoning Optimization with interleaved Policy Alignment), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GRPO to generate dense, process-level rewards and optimize reasoning at each intermediate step without human annotations. To overcome the cold-start problem, PROPA interleaves GRPO updates with SFT, enabling the model to learn from both successful and failed reasoning trajectories. A Process Reward Model (PRM) is further trained to guide inference-time search, aligning the test-time search with the training signal. Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines. It achieves up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art, establishing a strong reasoning and generalization capability for visual reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: RUDDER是一个低开销框架，通过单次前向传播提取视觉证据向量，并使用自适应门控机制引导LVLMs生成视觉一致的内容，有效缓解对象幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓解LVLMs对象幻觉的方法存在计算开销大的问题，通常需要额外前向传播，限制了在延迟敏感场景中的实用性。

Method: 提出RUDDER框架：1) CARD向量 - 在单次前向传播中从自注意力层残差更新提取视觉证据向量；2) 贝叶斯启发的自适应门控 - 根据模型偏离视觉上下文程度进行token级校正信号注入。

Result: 在POPE和CHAIR等幻觉基准测试中，RUDDER达到与最先进方法相当的性能，同时引入可忽略的计算延迟。

Conclusion: RUDDER是一个实用有效的框架，在不显著牺牲效率的前提下提高了LVLMs的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, generating text inconsistent with visual inputs, which can critically undermine their reliability. Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context. Extensive experiments on key hallucination benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR, indicate that RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency, validating RUDDER as a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without a significant compromise on efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星贫民窟分割对全球城市贫困估计很重要，但非正规住区的形态异质性导致模型难以泛化到未见区域。

Method: 构建了百万级卫星图像数据集，使用专家混合架构学习区域特定特征和通用特征，通过预测一致性过滤不可靠伪标签进行自适应。

Result: GRAM在低资源设置下优于最先进基线方法，特别是在非洲城市。

Conclusion: GRAM为全球贫民窟测绘和数据驱动的城市规划提供了可扩展且标签高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Satellite-based slum segmentation holds significant promise in generating global estimates of urban poverty. However, the morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements presents a major challenge, hindering the ability of models trained on specific regions to generalize effectively to unseen locations. To address this, we introduce a large-scale high-resolution dataset and propose GRAM (Generalized Region-Aware Mixture-of-Experts), a two-phase test-time adaptation framework that enables robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions. We compile a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents for source training. Using this dataset, the model employs a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to capture region-specific slum characteristics while learning universal features through a shared backbone. During adaptation, prediction consistency across experts filters out unreliable pseudo-labels, allowing the model to generalize effectively to previously unseen regions. GRAM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in low-resource settings such as African cities, offering a scalable and label-efficient solution for global slum mapping and data-driven urban planning.

TL;DR: LLaViT将LLM扩展为视觉Transformer，通过三个关键修改让LLM同时作为视觉编码器，在多个基准测试中显著优于LLaVA基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLaVA架构在整合视觉特征时的模态不匹配问题，从新视角让LLM不仅作为语言模型，还能作为强大的视觉编码器

Method: 1) 为视觉模态学习单独的QKV投影；2) 在视觉token上启用双向注意力；3) 结合全局和局部视觉表示

Result: 在广泛的LLM上进行的控制实验表明，LLaViT在多个基准测试中显著优于LLaVA基线方法，甚至超过参数数量翻倍的模型

Conclusion: LLaViT为视觉语言建模建立了更有效的方法，证明了LLM可以作为扩展视觉Transformer的可行性

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the LLaVA architecture for vision-language tasks, its design inherently struggles to effectively integrate visual features due to the inherent mismatch between text and vision modalities. We tackle this issue from a novel perspective in which the LLM not only serves as a language model but also a powerful vision encoder. To this end, we present LLaViT - Large Language Models as extended Vision Transformers - which enables the LLM to simultaneously function as a vision encoder through three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations. Through extensive controlled experiments on a wide range of LLMs, we demonstrate that LLaViT significantly outperforms the baseline LLaVA method on a multitude of benchmarks, even surpassing models with double its parameter count, establishing a more effective approach to vision-language modeling.

Conclusion: 通过专门设计的评估框架和移动部署测试，为开发更适合BLV用户需求的小型视觉语言模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at understanding and generating video descriptions but their high memory, computation, and deployment demands hinder practical use particularly for blind and low-vision (BLV) users who depend on detailed, context-aware descriptions. To study the effect of model size on accessibility-focused description quality, we evaluate SmolVLM2 variants with 500M and 2.2B parameters across two diverse datasets: AVCaps (outdoor), and Charades (indoor). In this work, we introduce two novel evaluation frameworks specifically designed for BLV accessibility assessment: the Multi-Context BLV Framework evaluating spatial orientation, social interaction, action events, and ambience contexts; and the Navigational Assistance Framework focusing on mobility-critical information. Additionally, we conduct a systematic evaluation of four different prompt design strategies and deploy both models on a smartphone, evaluating FP32 and INT8 precision variants to assess real-world performance constraints on resource-limited mobile devices.

Conclusion: 新评估指标能够更准确评估行人检测器在安全关键场景下的性能，为自动驾驶系统提供更可靠的性能基准

Abstract: Reliable pedestrian detection represents a crucial step towards automated driving systems. However, the current performance benchmarks exhibit weaknesses. The currently applied metrics for various subsets of a validation dataset prohibit a realistic performance evaluation of a DNN for pedestrian detection. As image segmentation supplies fine-grained information about a street scene, it can serve as a starting point to automatically distinguish between different types of errors during the evaluation of a pedestrian detector. In this work, eight different error categories for pedestrian detection are proposed and new metrics are proposed for performance comparison along these error categories. We use the new metrics to compare various backbones for a simplified version of the APD, and show a more fine-grained and robust way to compare models with each other especially in terms of safety-critical performance. We achieve SOTA on CityPersons-reasonable (without extra training data) by using a rather simple architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可见光图像和红外图像在物理特性上存在巨大差异，导致跨模态行人重识别任务面临挑战。需要一种能够有效对齐两种模态特征的方法。

Method: 1. 文本语义生成(TSG)：为可见光图像生成文本语义，实现可见光-文本模态初步对齐
2. 红外特征嵌入(IFE)：利用生成的文本语义修正红外图像特征嵌入，注入身份相关语义
3. 高层语义对齐(HSA)：精炼高层语义对齐，确保文本语义仅包含身份相关信息

Result: 在多个广泛使用的VI-ReID数据集上，CLIP4VI-ReID方法取得了优于其他最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过文本作为桥梁，实现了可见光-红外模态的间接对齐，有效提升了模态共享表示的可判别性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel CLIP-driven modality-shared representation learning network named CLIP4VI-ReID for VI-ReID task, which consists of Text Semantic Generation (TSG), Infrared Feature Embedding (IFE), and High-level Semantic Alignment (HSA). Specifically, considering the huge gap in the physical characteristics between natural images and infrared images, the TSG is designed to generate text semantics only for visible images, thereby enabling preliminary visible-text modality alignment. Then, the IFE is proposed to rectify the feature embeddings of infrared images using the generated text semantics. This process injects id-related semantics into the shared image encoder, enhancing its adaptability to the infrared modality. Besides, with text serving as a bridge, it enables indirect visible-infrared modality alignment. Finally, the HSA is established to refine the high-level semantic alignment. This process ensures that the fine-tuned text semantics only contain id-related information, thereby achieving more accurate cross-modal alignment and enhancing the discriminability of the learned modal-shared representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP4VI-ReID achieves superior performance than other state-of-the-art methods on some widely used VI-ReID datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时解决远场区域深度估计不准确和近场区域结构退化的问题，需要一种能处理极端深度变化的3D重建方法。

Method: 包含两个核心组件：1) 景深监督：使用尺度恢复的单目深度估计器生成深度先验，通过散焦卷积合成物理准确的散焦图像，并通过景深损失增强几何一致性；2) 多视角一致性监督：使用LoFTR半稠密特征匹配最小化跨视角几何误差，通过最小二乘优化可靠匹配点来强制深度一致性。

Result: 在Waymo Open Dataset上实现了0.8 dB的PSNR提升，显著提高了远场和近场区域的深度保真度。

Conclusion: 该框架将物理成像原理与基于学习的深度正则化相结合，为城市环境中复杂深度分层问题提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction in scenes with extreme depth variations remains challenging due to inconsistent supervisory signals between near-field and far-field regions. Existing methods fail to simultaneously address inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions. This paper proposes a novel computational framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to advance 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset. This framework bridges physical imaging principles and learning-based depth regularization, offering a scalable solution for complex depth stratification in urban environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法倾向于检测最显著响应片段，忽视挖掘与异常分离的多样化正常模式，且因外观相似性容易产生类别混淆，导致细粒度分类结果不理想。

Method: DSANet包含：1）粗粒度自引导正常建模分支，通过正常原型重构视频特征；2）细粒度解耦对比语义对齐机制，将视频分解为事件中心和背景中心组件进行视觉-语言对比学习。

Conclusion: DSANet通过显式分离异常和正常特征，从粗粒度和细粒度层面增强可区分性，有效提升了弱监督视频异常检测性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection have achieved remarkable performance by applying the multiple instance learning paradigm based on multimodal foundation models such as CLIP to highlight anomalous instances and classify categories. However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations. Comprehensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, namely XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅保留了CLIP的语义对齐优势，还增强了跨域的特征多样性和结构一致性，有效提升了单域泛化目标检测性能。

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) for object detection aims to train a model on a single source domain that can generalize effectively to unseen target domains. While recent methods like CLIP-based semantic augmentation have shown promise, they often overlook the underlying structure of feature distributions and frequency-domain characteristics that are critical for robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances SDG object detection by integrating the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and Fourier transformation into a CLIP-guided pipeline. Specifically, we model the directional features of object representations using vMF to better capture domain-invariant semantic structures in the embedding space. Additionally, we introduce a Fourier-based augmentation strategy that perturbs amplitude and phase components to simulate domain shifts in the frequency domain, further improving feature robustness. Our method not only preserves the semantic alignment benefits of CLIP but also enriches feature diversity and structural consistency across domains. Extensive experiments on the diverse weather-driving benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: AI-based dermatology adoption remains limited by biased datasets, variable image quality, and limited validation. We introduce DermAI, a lightweight, smartphone-based application that enables real-time capture, annotation, and classification of skin lesions during routine consultations. Unlike prior dermoscopy-focused tools, DermAI performs on-device quality checks, and local model adaptation. The DermAI clinical dataset, encompasses a wide range of skin tones, ethinicity and source devices. In preliminary experiments, models trained on public datasets failed to generalize to our samples, while fine-tuning with local data improved performance. These results highlight the importance of standardized, diverse data collection aligned with healthcare needs and oriented to machine learning development.

Method: 整合三种互补信号：输入空间的分布外检测、嵌入空间的分布外检测和任务特定的预测不确定性。

Conclusion: SHRUG-FM为气候敏感应用中更安全、更可解释的地理空间基础模型部署提供了途径，有助于弥合基准性能与现实世界可靠性之间的差距。

Abstract: Geospatial foundation models for Earth observation often fail to perform reliably in environments underrepresented during pretraining. We introduce SHRUG-FM, a framework for reliability-aware prediction that integrates three complementary signals: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in the input space, OOD detection in the embedding space and task-specific predictive uncertainty. Applied to burn scar segmentation, SHRUG-FM shows that OOD scores correlate with lower performance in specific environmental conditions, while uncertainty-based flags help discard many poorly performing predictions. Linking these flags to land cover attributes from HydroATLAS shows that failures are not random but concentrated in certain geographies, such as low-elevation zones and large river areas, likely due to underrepresentation in pretraining data. SHRUG-FM provides a pathway toward safer and more interpretable deployment of GFMs in climate-sensitive applications, helping bridge the gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability.

Result: 在GOAT-Bench和HM3D-OVON数据集上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: M3DSG和MSGNav有效解决了零样本导航中的视觉信息丢失和词汇限制问题，特别是通过显式解决最后一英里问题来提升导航准确性。

Abstract: Embodied navigation is a fundamental capability for robotic agents operating. Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead, motivating zero-shot methods rather than task-specific RL training. However, existing zero-shot methods that build explicit 3D scene graphs often compress rich visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG), which preserves visual cues by replacing textual relational edges with dynamically assigned images. Built on M3DSG, we propose MSGNav, a zero-shot navigation system that includes a Key Subgraph Selection module for efficient reasoning, an Adaptive Vocabulary Update module for open vocabulary support, and a Closed-Loop Reasoning module for accurate exploration reasoning. Additionally, we further identify the last-mile problem in zero-shot navigation - determining the feasible target location with a suitable final viewpoint, and propose a Visibility-based Viewpoint Decision module to explicitly resolve it. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGNav achieves state-of-the-art performance on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON datasets. The open-source code will be publicly available.

Method: 提出了AntiDB_Purify评估框架，系统评估现有防御方法在传统图像滤波器和对抗性净化等现实净化威胁下的有效性。

Result: 结果显示当前所有防御方法在净化威胁下都无法保持其保护效果，现有防御方法提供的是一种虚假的安全感。

Conclusion: 当前防御方法存在严重不足，迫切需要开发更不可感知和鲁棒的保护机制来保护个性化生成中的用户身份安全。

Abstract: Personalized AI applications such as DreamBooth enable the generation of customized content from user images, but also raise significant privacy concerns, particularly the risk of facial identity leakage. Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification. Results reveal that none of the current methods maintains their protective effectiveness under such threats. These findings highlight that current defenses offer a false sense of security and underscore the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protections to safeguard user identity in personalized generation.

Abstract: Lane detection is an important topic in the future mobility solutions. Real-world environmental challenges such as background clutter, varying illumination, and occlusions pose significant obstacles to effective lane detection, particularly when relying on data-driven approaches that require substantial effort and cost for data collection and annotation. To address these issues, lane detection methods must leverage contextual and global information from surrounding lanes and objects. In this paper, we propose a Spatial Attention Mutual Information Regularization with a pre-trained model as an Oracle, called SAMIRO. SAMIRO enhances lane detection performance by transferring knowledge from a pretrained model while preserving domain-agnostic spatial information. Leveraging SAMIRO's plug-and-play characteristic, we integrate it into various state-of-the-art lane detection approaches and conduct extensive experiments on major benchmarks such as CULane, Tusimple, and LLAMAS. The results demonstrate that SAMIRO consistently improves performance across different models and datasets. The code will be made available upon publication.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的Transformer-VAE架构，用于从Sentinel-2数据中反演PROSAIL辐射传输模型，实现植被生物物理参数的准确估算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从卫星影像中准确获取植被生物物理变量对于生态系统监测和农业管理至关重要，需要开发无需真实卫星图像训练即可实现高性能的方法。

Method: 使用Transformer-VAE架构，将PROSAIL模型作为可微分物理解码器，仅使用模拟数据进行训练，确保推断的潜变量对应物理上合理的叶子和冠层属性。

Result: 在真实野外数据集（FRM4Veg和BelSAR）上实现了叶面积指数（LAI）和冠层叶绿素含量（CCC）的准确反演，性能与使用真实Sentinel-2数据训练的最先进方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法无需实地标签或真实图像校准，为全球植被监测提供了一种经济高效的自监督解决方案，展示了物理模型与深度网络结合在辐射传输模型反演中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables from satellite imagery is crucial for ecosystem monitoring and agricultural management. In this work, we propose a physics-informed Transformer-VAE architecture to invert the PROSAIL radiative transfer model for simultaneous estimation of key canopy parameters from Sentinel-2 data. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that require real satellite images for self-supevised training. Our model is trained exclusively on simulated data, yet achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods that utilize real imagery. The Transformer-VAE incorporates the PROSAIL model as a differentiable physical decoder, ensuring that inferred latent variables correspond to physically plausible leaf and canopy properties. We demonstrate retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) on real-world field datasets (FRM4Veg and BelSAR) with accuracy comparable to models trained with real Sentinel-2 data. Our method requires no in-situ labels or calibration on real images, offering a cost-effective and self-supervised solution for global vegetation monitoring. The proposed approach illustrates how integrating physical models with advanced deep networks can improve the inversion of RTMs, opening new prospects for large-scale, physically-constrained remote sensing of vegetation traits.

TL;DR: MonkeyOCR v1.5是一个统一的视觉语言框架，通过两阶段解析流程增强文档布局理解和内容识别，在复杂文档场景下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界文档通常具有复杂的布局，包含多级表格、嵌入式图像或公式以及跨页结构，这对现有OCR系统构成挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段解析流程：第一阶段使用大型多模态模型联合预测文档布局和阅读顺序；第二阶段在检测区域内进行文本、公式和表格的局部识别。针对复杂表格结构，提出基于视觉一致性的强化学习方案，并引入图像解耦表格解析和类型引导表格合并两个专门模块。

Result: 在OmniDocBench v1.5上的综合实验表明，MonkeyOCR v1.5实现了最先进的性能，优于PPOCR-VL和MinerU 2.5，在视觉复杂文档场景中表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR v1.5通过统一的视觉语言框架和专门设计的模块，有效解决了复杂文档解析的挑战，为文档智能应用提供了可靠的基础技术。

Abstract: Document parsing is a core task in document intelligence, supporting applications such as information extraction, retrieval-augmented generation, and automated document analysis. However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.

TL;DR: GrounDiff是首个基于扩散模型的DTM生成框架，通过迭代去噪移除非地面结构，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DTM生成方法依赖手动调参，而基于学习的方法需要复杂架构和后处理。为解决这些问题，作者提出了扩散模型框架。

Method: 提出GrounDiff扩散框架，采用门控设计和置信度引导生成；进一步提出PrioStitch方法，使用下采样全局先验指导局部高分辨率预测。

Result: 在ALS2DTM上RMSE降低93%，USGS基准上降低47%；道路重建任务中距离误差降低81%，同时保持表面平滑度。

Conclusion: GrounDiff在DTM生成和道路重建任务中均优于现有方法，证明了扩散模型在地形建模中的有效性。

Abstract: Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) represent the bare-earth elevation and are important in numerous geospatial applications. Such data models cannot be directly measured by sensors and are typically generated from Digital Surface Models (DSMs) derived from LiDAR or photogrammetry. Traditional filtering approaches rely on manually tuned parameters, while learning-based methods require well-designed architectures, often combined with post-processing. To address these challenges, we introduce Ground Diffusion (GrounDiff), the first diffusion-based framework that iteratively removes non-ground structures by formulating the problem as a denoising task. We incorporate a gated design with confidence-guided generation that enables selective filtering. To increase scalability, we further propose Prior-Guided Stitching (PrioStitch), which employs a downsampled global prior automatically generated using GrounDiff to guide local high-resolution predictions. We evaluate our method on the DSM-to-DTM translation task across diverse datasets, showing that GrounDiff consistently outperforms deep learning-based state-of-the-art methods, reducing RMSE by up to 93% on ALS2DTM and up to 47% on USGS benchmarks. In the task of road reconstruction, which requires both high precision and smoothness, our method achieves up to 81% lower distance error compared to specialized techniques on the GeRoD benchmark, while maintaining competitive surface smoothness using only DSM inputs, without task-specific optimization. Our variant for road reconstruction, GrounDiff+, is specifically designed to produce even smoother surfaces, further surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该框架显著提高了诊断结果的可解释性，为风力涡轮机运维提供了实用的决策支持。

Abstract: The health condition of wind turbine (WT) components is crucial for ensuring stable and reliable operation. However, existing fault detection methods are largely limited to visual recognition, producing structured outputs that lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making. To address these limitations, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines YOLOMS with a large language model (LLM) for intelligent fault analysis and diagnosis. Specifically, YOLOMS employs multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping to enhance fault feature extraction, while a lightweight key-value (KV) mapping module bridges the gap between visual outputs and textual inputs. This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a fault detection accuracy of 90.6\% and generates maintenance reports with an average accuracy of 89\%, thereby improving the interpretability of diagnostic results and providing practical decision support for the operation and maintenance of wind turbines.

Abstract: Acquiring standard facial planes during routine fetal ultrasound (US) examinations is often challenging due to fetal movement, variability in orientation, and operator-dependent expertise. These factors contribute to inconsistencies, increased examination time, and potential diagnostic bias.
  To address these challenges in the context of facial assessment, we present: 1) GT++, a robust algorithm that estimates standard facial planes from 3D US volumes using annotated anatomical landmarks; and 2) 3DFETUS, a deep learning model that automates and standardizes their localization in 3D fetal US volumes.
  We evaluated our methods both qualitatively, through expert clinical review, and quantitatively. The proposed approach achieved a mean translation error of 4.13 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.93 degrees per plane, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods on 3D US volumes. Clinical assessments further confirmed the effectiveness of both GT++ and 3DFETUS, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in plane estimation accuracy.

Result: 腺体分割Dice得分0.83±0.17；在760张WSI中提取38万个腺体，MIL模型AUC提升10%，发现15个腺体簇与癌症复发、致癌突变和高Gleason评分相关

Conclusion: HIT通过关注生物意义结构，提高了MIL预测的准确性和可解释性，同时简化了计算

Abstract: Histopathologists establish cancer grade by assessing histological structures, such as glands in prostate cancer. Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.

Conclusion: OpenSR-SRGAN通过将基于GAN的超分辨率转变为配置驱动的工作流程，为地球观测数据集的超分辨率应用提供了实用工具和基准实现。

Abstract: We present OpenSR-SRGAN, an open and modular framework for single-image super-resolution in Earth Observation. The software provides a unified implementation of SRGAN-style models that is easy to configure, extend, and apply to multispectral satellite data such as Sentinel-2. Instead of requiring users to modify model code, OpenSR-SRGAN exposes generators, discriminators, loss functions, and training schedules through concise configuration files, making it straightforward to switch between architectures, scale factors, and band setups. The framework is designed as a practical tool and benchmark implementation rather than a state-of-the-art model. It ships with ready-to-use configurations for common remote sensing scenarios, sensible default settings for adversarial training, and built-in hooks for logging, validation, and large-scene inference. By turning GAN-based super-resolution into a configuration-driven workflow, OpenSR-SRGAN lowers the entry barrier for researchers and practitioners who wish to experiment with SRGANs, compare models in a reproducible way, and deploy super-resolution pipelines across diverse Earth-observation datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2型糖尿病早期检测至关重要，但胰腺表面分叶度在T2DM患者中的作用尚未充分研究，需要开发自动化筛查方法。

Method: 使用四种深度学习模型在584名患者数据集上分割胰腺，自动检测PSL，并构建多变量模型利用CT生物标志物预测T2DM。

Result: 糖尿病患者PSL显著更高（4.26±8.32 vs 3.19±3.62，p=0.01），PancAP模型达到最高Dice分数0.79±0.17，T2DM预测模型获得0.90 AUC、66.7%敏感性和91.9%特异性。

Conclusion: PSL对T2DM筛查有用，可能有助于预测2型糖尿病的早期发病。

Abstract: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients. The PancAP model achieved the highest Dice score of 0.79 $\pm$ 0.17 and lowest ASSD error of 1.94 $\pm$ 2.63 mm (p$<$0.05). For predicting T2DM, a multivariate model trained with CT biomarkers attained 0.90 AUC, 66.7\% sensitivity, and 91.9\% specificity. Our results suggest that PSL is useful for T2DM screening and could potentially help predict the early onset of T2DM.

Conclusion: SPOT提供了一个上下文感知且可解释的相关性检测过程，支持适应不同资源约束的各种性能水平，其多功能设计使其能够有效提升ViT的计算效率。

Abstract: While Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their computational demands are substantial, scaling quadratically with the number of processed tokens. Compact attention representations, reflecting token interaction distributions, can guide early detection and reduction of less salient tokens prior to attention computation. Motivated by this, we present SParsification with attentiOn dynamics via Token relevance (SPOT), a framework for early detection of redundant tokens within ViTs that leverages token embeddings, interactions, and attention dynamics across layers to infer token importance, resulting in a more context-aware and interpretable relevance detection process. SPOT informs token sparsification and facilitates the elimination of such tokens, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. SPOT employs computationally lightweight predictors that can be plugged into various ViT architectures and learn to derive effective input-specific token prioritization across layers. Its versatile design supports a range of performance levels adaptable to varying resource constraints. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant efficiency gains of up to 40% compared to standard ViTs, while maintaining or even improving accuracy.

Conclusion: LTV为黑盒CNN提供了可解释的替代方案，并为3D和数据一致性驱动的重建奠定了基础。

Abstract: Although Total Variation (TV) performs well in noise reduction and edge preservation on images, its dependence on the lambda parameter limits its efficiency and makes it difficult to use effectively. In this study, we present a Learnable Total Variation (LTV) framework that couples an unrolled TV solver with a data-driven Lambda Mapping Network (LambdaNet) predicting a per-pixel regularization map. The pipeline is trained end-to-end so that reconstruction and regularization are optimized jointly, yielding spatially adaptive smoothing: strong in homogeneous regions, relaxed near anatomical boundaries. Experiments on the DeepLesion dataset, using a realistic noise model adapted from the LoDoPaB-CT methodology, show consistent gains over classical TV and FBP+U-Net: +2.9 dB PSNR and +6% SSIM on average. LTV provides an interpretable alternative to black-box CNNs and a basis for 3D and data-consistency-driven reconstruction. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/itu-biai/deep_tv_for_ldct

Motivation: 当前VLA模型在机器人操作中存在两个关键限制：1）感知冗余，处理无关视觉输入效率低下；2）浅层的指令-视觉对齐，阻碍了动作的语义基础。

Conclusion: SemanticVLA通过语义对齐的稀疏化和增强技术，有效解决了VLA模型在机器人操作中的关键限制，实现了更高效和可解释的行为建模。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced in robotic manipulation, yet practical deployment remains hindered by two key limitations: 1) perceptual redundancy, where irrelevant visual inputs are processed inefficiently, and 2) superficial instruction-vision alignment, which hampers semantic grounding of actions. In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA

Conclusion: 提出的Separate-then-Map策略通过信息映射机制有效解决了分离建模组件间的协调问题，实现了更高质量的动态人体与场景重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic humans interacting with real-world environments from monocular videos is an important and challenging task. Despite considerable progress in 4D neural rendering, existing approaches either model dynamic scenes holistically or model scenes and backgrounds separately aim to introduce parametric human priors. However, these approaches either neglect distinct motion characteristics of various components in scene especially human, leading to incomplete reconstructions, or ignore the information exchange between the separately modeled components, resulting in spatial inconsistencies and visual artifacts at human-scene boundaries. To address this, we propose {\bf Separate-then-Map} (StM) strategy that introduces a dedicated information mapping mechanism to bridge separately defined and optimized models. Our method employs a shared transformation function for each Gaussian attribute to unify separately modeled components, enhancing computational efficiency by avoiding exhaustive pairwise interactions while ensuring spatial and visual coherence between humans and their surroundings. Extensive experiments on monocular video datasets demonstrate that StM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and rendering accuracy, particularly at challenging human-scene interaction boundaries.

Abstract: Despite advances in generation quality, current text-to-image (T2I) models often lack diversity, generating homogeneous outputs. This work introduces a framework to address the need for robust diversity evaluation in T2I models. Our framework systematically assesses diversity by evaluating individual concepts and their relevant factors of variation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel human evaluation template for nuanced diversity assessment; (2) a curated prompt set covering diverse concepts with their identified factors of variation (e.g. prompt: An image of an apple, factor of variation: color); and (3) a methodology for comparing models in terms of human annotations via binomial tests.
  Furthermore, we rigorously compare various image embeddings for diversity measurement. Notably, our principled approach enables ranking of T2I models by diversity, identifying categories where they particularly struggle. This research offers a robust methodology and insights, paving the way for improvements in T2I model diversity and metric development.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的代码到风格图像生成任务，通过数值风格代码生成具有新颖、一致视觉风格的图像，并开发了首个开源方法CoTyle。

Conclusion: 本文开创了代码到风格图像生成的新领域，通过CoTyle方法实现了从最小输入生成大量可复现风格的能力，为艺术创作提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Innovative visual stylization is a cornerstone of artistic creation, yet generating novel and consistent visual styles remains a significant challenge. Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniVGGT是一个能够有效利用任意数量几何模态（深度、相机内外参）的3D基础模型框架，通过GeoAdapter和随机多模态融合策略，在保持推理速度的同时提升多种3D视觉任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D基础模型大多仅使用RGB输入，忽略了可用的几何线索（相机参数、深度图等），限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出GeoAdapter使用零初始化卷积渐进注入几何信息，不破坏基础模型表示空间；采用随机多模态融合策略，训练时随机采样模态子集，测试时可接受任意数量模态输入。

Result: 在单目/多视角深度估计、多视角立体视觉和相机位姿估计等任务中超越现有方法，即使仅用RGB输入也能达到SOTA；集成到VLA模型后在机器人任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: OmniVGGT通过有效利用几何模态，显著提升了3D视觉任务的性能，并展示了在机器人应用中的实用价值。

Abstract: General 3D foundation models have started to lead the trend of unifying diverse vision tasks, yet most assume RGB-only inputs and ignore readily available geometric cues (e.g., camera intrinsics, poses, and depth maps). To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models. The enhanced VLA model by OmniVGGT not only outperforms the vanilla point-cloud-based baseline on mainstream benchmarks, but also effectively leverages accessible auxiliary inputs to achieve consistent gains on robotic tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M&M-3D是一种用于数字乳腺断层合成（DBT）的深度学习架构，能够在保持参数不变的情况下实现可学习的3D推理，通过直接迁移FFDM模型的权重来解决DBT标注数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DBT通过提供体积信息提高了乳腺癌检测的可见性，但标注数据有限限制了深度学习模型的发展。现有方法要么丢弃体积信息，要么需要复杂的3D架构和更多训练数据。

Method: M&M-3D构建恶性指导的3D特征，通过重复混合这些3D特征与切片级信息来学习3D推理，修改M&M的操作而不增加参数，从而实现从FFDM的直接权重迁移。

Result: M&M-3D在定位任务上比2D投影和3D切片方法提升11-54%，在分类任务上提升3-10%。在低数据情况下，比复杂3D变体在定位上提升20-47%，分类上提升2-10%，在高数据情况下性能相当。在BCS-DBT基准上，分类提升4%，定位提升10%。

Conclusion: M&M-3D通过参数不变的方式实现有效的3D推理，解决了DBT数据稀缺问题，在定位和分类任务上都显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) enhances finding visibility for breast cancer detection by providing volumetric information that reduces the impact of overlapping tissues; however, limited annotated data has constrained the development of deep learning models for DBT. To address data scarcity, existing methods attempt to reuse 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM) models by either flattening DBT volumes or processing slices individually, thus discarding volumetric information. Alternatively, 3D reasoning approaches introduce complex architectures that require more DBT training data. Tackling these drawbacks, we propose M&M-3D, an architecture that enables learnable 3D reasoning while remaining parameter-free relative to its FFDM counterpart, M&M. M&M-3D constructs malignancy-guided 3D features, and 3D reasoning is learned through repeatedly mixing these 3D features with slice-level information. This is achieved by modifying operations in M&M without adding parameters, thus enabling direct weight transfer from FFDM. Extensive experiments show that M&M-3D surpasses 2D projection and 3D slice-based methods by 11-54% for localization and 3-10% for classification. Additionally, M&M-3D outperforms complex 3D reasoning variants by 20-47% for localization and 2-10% for classification in the low-data regime, while matching their performance in high-data regime. On the popular BCS-DBT benchmark, M&M-3D outperforms previous top baseline by 4% for classification and 10% for localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多任务全局-局部OBIA-Mamba模型，用于提升Sentinel-2影像的土地利用分类精度，通过结合超像素分割、双分支架构和多任务优化来解决空间异质性等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentinel-2影像的土地利用分类面临空间异质性、上下文信息和特征模糊等关键数据挑战，需要一种能够同时保留精细细节和全局上下文信息的方法。

Method: 设计了三个核心组件：1) 基于超像素的OBIA-Mamba模型减少冗余计算；2) 全局-局部双分支CNN-Mamba架构联合建模局部空间细节和全局上下文；3) 多任务优化框架使用双损失函数平衡局部精度与全局一致性。

Result: 在加拿大阿尔伯塔省的Sentinel-2影像上进行测试，与多种先进分类方法比较，结果显示该方法获得了更高的分类精度和更精细的细节。

Conclusion: 所提出的MSOM方法在Sentinel-2土地利用分类中表现出优越性能，能够有效解决空间异质性和上下文建模问题，为环境监测应用提供了更准确的分类结果。

Abstract: Although Sentinel-2 based land use and land cover (LULC) classification is critical for various environmental monitoring applications, it is a very difficult task due to some key data challenges (e.g., spatial heterogeneity, context information, signature ambiguity). This paper presents a novel Multitask Glocal OBIA-Mamba (MSOM) for enhanced Sentinel-2 classification with the following contributions. First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency. The proposed approach is tested on Sentinel-2 imagery in Alberta, Canada, in comparison with several advanced classification approaches, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy and finer details that the other state-of-the-art methods.

*Aleksandr Razin,Danil Kazantsev,Ilya Makarov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA)，一种在VAE解码前直接在潜在空间进行超分辨率的轻量级模块，解决了扩散模型高分辨率采样的效率和伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型难以扩展到训练分辨率之外，直接高分辨率采样缓慢昂贵，而事后图像超分辨率会引入伪影和额外延迟。

Method: LUA作为即插即用组件，在生成器的潜在代码上进行超分辨率，使用共享Swin风格骨干网络和尺度特定的像素洗牌头，支持2倍和4倍上采样。

Result: LUA在感知质量上与像素空间超分辨率相当，但解码和上采样时间降低了近3倍（1024px生成仅增加0.42秒，而像素空间SR需要1.87秒），且在不同VAE的潜在空间中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: LUA在保持原生高分辨率生成保真度的同时，为现代扩散管道提供了实用且高效的可扩展高保真图像合成路径。

Abstract: Diffusion models struggle to scale beyond their training resolutions, as direct high-resolution sampling is slow and costly, while post-hoc image super-resolution (ISR) introduces artifacts and additional latency by operating after decoding. We present the Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA), a lightweight module that performs super-resolution directly on the generator's latent code before the final VAE decoding step. LUA integrates as a drop-in component, requiring no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages, and enables high-resolution synthesis through a single feed-forward pass in latent space. A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LUA closely matches the fidelity of native high-resolution generation while offering a practical and efficient path to scalable, high-fidelity image synthesis in modern diffusion pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Depth Anything 3 (DA3) 是一个能够从任意数量视觉输入预测空间一致几何的模型，无需已知相机位姿。该模型采用极简设计，使用单一普通Transformer作为骨干网络，通过师生训练范式达到与DA2相当的细节和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 追求最小化建模，证明无需架构专业化或复杂多任务学习即可实现高质量的几何预测。

Method: 使用单一普通Transformer（如DINO编码器）作为骨干网络，采用单一深度射线预测目标，通过师生训练范式进行训练。

Result: 在新建的视觉几何基准测试中，DA3在所有任务上均达到新的SOTA，相机位姿精度平均提升44.3%，几何精度提升25.1%，并在单目深度估计上超越DA2。

Conclusion: DA3证明了极简设计在视觉几何任务中的有效性，仅使用公开学术数据集训练即可实现最先进的性能。

Abstract: We present Depth Anything 3 (DA3), a model that predicts spatially consistent geometry from an arbitrary number of visual inputs, with or without known camera poses. In pursuit of minimal modeling, DA3 yields two key insights: a single plain transformer (e.g., vanilla DINO encoder) is sufficient as a backbone without architectural specialization, and a singular depth-ray prediction target obviates the need for complex multi-task learning. Through our teacher-student training paradigm, the model achieves a level of detail and generalization on par with Depth Anything 2 (DA2). We establish a new visual geometry benchmark covering camera pose estimation, any-view geometry and visual rendering. On this benchmark, DA3 sets a new state-of-the-art across all tasks, surpassing prior SOTA VGGT by an average of 44.3% in camera pose accuracy and 25.1% in geometric accuracy. Moreover, it outperforms DA2 in monocular depth estimation. All models are trained exclusively on public academic datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自洽采样(SCS)方法，解决多模态大语言模型在强化学习中正确猜测但推理错误轨迹获得相同奖励的问题，通过在视觉扰动和轨迹重采样中计算一致性分数来优化策略更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多模态推理基准测试中，强化学习面临一个被忽视的障碍：即使推理链错误但最终猜对选项的轨迹，与真正正确推理的轨迹获得相同奖励，这影响了学习效果。

Method: 自洽采样(SCS)：对每个问题(i)引入小的视觉扰动，(ii)重复截断和重采样初始轨迹，通过结果轨迹的一致性产生可微的一致性分数，在策略更新时降低不可靠轨迹的权重。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct上，将SCS集成到RLOO、GRPO和REINFORCE++系列中，在六个多模态基准测试上准确率提升高达7.7个百分点，计算开销可忽略。在Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct和InternVL3-8B上也取得显著提升。

Conclusion: SCS为多模态大语言模型中的结果奖励强化学习提供了一个简单通用的解决方案，有效解决了不可靠推理轨迹的问题。

Abstract: Outcome-reward reinforcement learning (RL) is a common and increasingly significant way to refine the step-by-step reasoning of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In the multiple-choice setting - a dominant format for multimodal reasoning benchmarks - the paradigm faces a significant yet often overlooked obstacle: unfaithful trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which is a flaw that cannot be ignored. We propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) to correct this issue. For each question, SCS (i) introduces small visual perturbations and (ii) performs repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory; agreement among the resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates. Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, plugging SCS into RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation. SCS also yields notable gains on both Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.

Abstract: Resource orchestration and configuration parameter search are key concerns for container-based infrastructure in cloud data centers. Large configuration search space and cloud uncertainties are often mitigated using contextual bandit techniques for resource orchestration including the state-of-the-art Drone orchestrator. Complexity in the cloud provider environment due to varying numbers of virtual machines introduces variability in workloads and resource metrics, making orchestration decisions less accurate due to increased nonlinearity and noise. Ksurf, a state-of-the-art variance-minimizing estimator method ideal for highly variable cloud data, enables optimal resource estimation under conditions of high cloud variability.
  This work evaluates the performance of Ksurf on estimation-based resource orchestration tasks involving highly variable workloads when employed as a contextual multi-armed bandit objective function model for cloud scenarios using Drone. Ksurf enables significantly lower latency variance of $41\%$ at p95 and $47\%$ at p99, demonstrates a $4\%$ reduction in CPU usage and 7 MB reduction in master node memory usage on Kubernetes, resulting in a $7\%$ cost savings in average worker pod count on VarBench Kubernetes benchmark.

Abstract: Transaction scheduling is crucial to efficiently allocate shared resources in a conflict-free manner in distributed systems. We investigate the efficient scheduling of transactions in a network of fog-cloud computing model, where transactions and their associated shared objects can move within the network. The schedule may require objects to move to transaction nodes, or the transactions to move to the object nodes. Moreover, the schedule may determine intermediate nodes where both objects and transactions meet. Our goal is to minimize the total combined cost of the schedule. We focus on networks of constant doubling dimension, which appear frequently in practice. We consider a batch problem where an arbitrary set of nodes has transactions that need to be scheduled. First, we consider a single shared object required by all the transactions and present a scheduling algorithm that gives an $O(\log n \cdot \log D)$ approximation of the optimal schedule, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $D$ is the diameter of the network. Later, we consider transactions accessing multiple shared objects (at most $k$ objects per transaction) and provide a scheduling algorithm that gives an $O(k \cdot \log n \cdot \log D)$ approximation. We also provide a fully distributed version of the scheduling algorithms where the nodes do not need global knowledge of transactions.

Abstract: GPU systems are increasingly powering modern datacenters at scale. Despite being highly performant, GPU systems suffer from performance variation at the node and cluster levels. Such performance variation significantly impacts both high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads, such as cutting-edge large language models (LLMs). We analyze the performance of a single-node multi-GPU system running LLM training, and observe that the kernel-level performance variation is highly correlated with concurrent computation communication (C3), a technique to overlap computation and communication across GPUs for performance gains. We then take a further step to reason that thermally induced straggling coupling with C3 impacts performance variation, coined as the Lit Silicon effect. Lit Silicon describes that in a multi-GPU node, thermal imbalance across GPUs introduces node-level straggler GPUs, which in turn slow down the leader GPUs. Lit Silicon leads to node-level performance variation and inefficiency, impacting the entire datacenter from the bottom up. We propose analytical performance and power models for Lit Silicon, to understand the potential system-level gains. We further design simple detection and mitigation techniques to effectively address the Lit Silicon problem, and evaluate three different power management solutions, including power optimization under GPU thermal design power, performance optimization under node-level GPU power capping, and performance optimization under node-level CPU power sloshing. We conduct experiments on two workloads on two AMD InstinctTM MI300X GPU systems under two LLM training frameworks, and observe up to 6% performance and 4% power improvements, potentially saving hundreds of millions of dollars in datacenters. Our solution is almost free lunch and can be effortlessly adopted in datacenters as a new node-level power management layer.

Conclusion: MoFa为LLM预训练系统设计和部署提供了可靠的事前指导，能够有效解决大规模分布式预训练中的优化挑战。

Abstract: The exponential growth in LLM scales, with parameters soaring from billions to trillions, has necessitated distributed pretraining across large clusters comprising thousands to tens of thousands of devices. While hybrid parallelization strategies enable such pretraining, the vast combinatorial strategy space introduces significant optimization challenges. Traditional manual tuning methods incur prohibitive trial-and-error costs, and existing performance modeling approaches exhibit critical limitations: they fail to comprehensively account for prevalent optimization features and ignore the substantial overhead imposed by essential fault tolerance mechanisms like checkpoint recovery in long-duration pretraining. To address these gaps, we propose MoFa, a novel pretraining performance modeling framework that unifies multi-dimensional optimization features and fault tolerance. MoFa incorporates an enhanced cost model to accurately capture the effects of key optimizations and integrates a fault tolerance model based on historical cluster reliability data. Besides, a MoFa-based tuning system is developed to explore optimal pretraining performance and potential bottlenecks in various scenarios. Extensive modeling evaluations demonstrate that MoFa can achieve high prediction accuracy across various scenarios. In addition, through comprehensive tuning experiments, our framework systematically reveals the key factors influencing pretraining performance under different configurations, which provides solid a priori guidance for LLM pretraining system design and deployment.

Motivation: 云虚拟机中的缓存优化通常无效，因为VM无法了解和控制缓存配置细节，包括CPU缓存分区、共享情况以及内存到缓存的映射关系。

Method: 提出CacheX解决方案，使用驱逐集在VM内探测精确细粒度的缓存抽象，无需硬件或hypervisor支持，并开发了LLC争用感知任务调度和虚拟颜色感知页面缓存管理两种新技术。

Result: 在x86 Linux内核中实现的CacheX评估表明，它能有效提高公共云虚拟机中各种工作负载的缓存利用率。

Conclusion: CacheX通过提供准确的缓存抽象信息，使得云虚拟机能够更好地利用缓存资源，解决了传统缓存优化在云环境中的局限性。

Abstract: This paper shows that cache-based optimizations are often ineffective in cloud virtual machines (VMs) due to limited visibility into and control over provisioned caches. In public clouds, CPU caches can be partitioned or shared among VMs, but a VM is unaware of cache provisioning details. Moreover, a VM cannot influence cache usage via page placement policies, as memory-to-cache mappings are hidden. The paper proposes a novel solution, CacheX, which probes accurate and fine-grained cache abstraction within VMs using eviction sets without requiring hardware or hypervisor support, and showcases the utility of the probed information with two new techniques: LLC contention-aware task scheduling and virtual color-aware page cache management. Our evaluation of CacheX's implementation in x86 Linux kernel demonstrates that it can effectively improve cache utilization for various workloads in public cloud VMs.

Method: 使用被动测量（到达率、利用率、负载大小）和指数调制有理延迟模型，计算平衡预测延迟和可靠性的分数，结合滞后切换确保只在预期收益显著时才进行切换

Result: MO-HAN始终优于静态和公平分布基线，降低平均和尾部延迟，同时比纯机会选择减少近50%的切换次数

Conclusion: MO-HAN无需侵入式检测或重型学习基础设施，在资源受限的嵌入式设备上实用性强

Abstract: Latency-sensitive embedded applications increasingly rely on edge computing, yet dynamic network congestion in multi-server architectures challenges proper edge server selection. This paper proposes a lightweight server-selection method for edge applications that fuses latency prediction with adaptive reliability and hysteresis-based handover. Using passive measurements (arrival rate, utilization, payload size) and an exponentially modulated rational delay model, the proposed Moderate Handover (MO-HAN) method computes a score that balances predicted latency and reliability to ensure handovers occur only when the expected gain is meaningful and maintain reduced end-to-end latency. Results show that MO-HAN consistently outperforms static and fair-distribution baselines by lowering mean and tail latencies, while reducing handovers by nearly 50% compared to pure opportunistic selection. These gains arise without intrusive instrumentation or heavy learning infrastructure, making MO-HAN practical for resource-constrained embedded devices.

Conclusion: 基于监督学习的稀疏矩阵重排序算法选择模型能够有效提升求解效率，实现智能化的算法选择。

Abstract: Sparse matrix ordering is a vital optimization technique often employed for solving large-scale sparse matrices. Its goal is to minimize the matrix bandwidth by reorganizing its rows and columns, thus enhancing efficiency. Conventional methods for algorithm selection usually depend on brute-force search or empirical knowledge, lacking the ability to adjust to diverse sparse matrix structures.As a result, we have introduced a supervised learning-based model for choosing sparse matrix reordering algorithms. This model grasps the correlation between matrix characteristics and commonly utilized reordering algorithms, facilitating the automated and intelligent selection of the suitable sparse matrix reordering algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Florida sparse matrix dataset reveal that our model can accurately predict the optimal reordering algorithm for various matrices, leading to a 55.37% reduction in solution time compared to solely using the AMD reordering algorithm, with an average speedup ratio of 1.45.

Abstract: Optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on large-scale AI training and inference systems requires a scalable and expressive mechanism to model distributed workload execution. Such modeling is essential for pre-deployment system-level optimizations (e.g., parallelization strategies) and design-space explorations. While recent efforts have proposed collecting execution traces from real systems, access to large-scale infrastructure remains limited to major cloud providers. Moreover, traces obtained from existing platforms cannot be easily adapted to study future larger-scale system configurations. We introduce Symbolic Tensor grAph GEnerator(STAGE), a framework that synthesizes high-fidelity execution traces to accurately model LLM workloads. STAGE supports a comprehensive set of parallelization strategies, allowing users to systematically explore a wide spectrum of LLM architectures and system configurations. STAGE demonstrates its scalability by synthesizing high-fidelity LLM traces spanning over 32K GPUs, while preserving tensor-level accuracy in compute, memory, and communication. STAGE will be publicly available to facilitate further research in distributed machine learning systems.

Motivation: 解决先前仅依赖最短路径计算的轨迹匿名化方法无法捕捉真实旅行行为的问题，提高匿名化数据的实用性。

Method: 开发了FPGA硬件架构，集成并行历史轨迹搜索和传统最短路径查找，使用自定义定点计数模块准确加权历史数据贡献。

Result: 实现超过6,000条记录/秒的实时吞吐量，数据保留率比先前设计提高1.2%，更有效地保留主要干道。

Conclusion: 该架构实现了高保真、历史感知的匿名化，在LBS严格延迟约束下同时保护隐私和行为准确性。

Abstract: Our previous work established the feasibility of FPGA-based real-time trajectory anonymization, a critical task for protecting user privacy in modern location-based services (LBS). However, that pioneering approach relied exclusively on shortest-path computations, which can fail to capture re- alistic travel behavior and thus reduce the utility of the anonymized data. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel, history-aware trajectory k-anonymization methodology and presents an advanced FPGA-based hardware architecture to implement it. Our proposed architecture uniquely integrates par- allel history-based trajectory searches with conventional shortest- path finding, using a custom fixed-point counting module to ac- curately weigh contributions from historical data. This approach enables the system to prioritize behaviorally common routes over geometrically shorter but less-traveled paths. The FPGA implementation demonstrates that our new architecture achieves a real-time throughput of over 6,000 records/s, improves data retention by up to 1.2% compared to our previous shortest-path- only design, and preserves major arterial roads more effectively. These results signify a key advancement, enabling high-fidelity, history-aware anonymization that preserves both privacy and behavioral accuracy under the strict latency constraints of LBS.

TL;DR: AssertMiner是一个模块级断言生成框架，利用AST静态信息辅助LLM挖掘模块级断言，提升验证覆盖率和错误检测能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于设计规范的断言生成方法通常只产生顶层断言，忽略了微架构级别模块中更频繁出现设计错误的实现细节验证需求

Method: 通过AST结构提取获取模块调用图、I/O表和数据流图，引导LLM生成模块级规范并挖掘模块级断言

Result: AssertMiner在生成模块高质量断言方面优于AssertLLM和Spec2Assertion，集成后可显著提升结构覆盖率和错误检测能力

Conclusion: AssertMiner能够实现更全面高效的验证过程，解决了模块级断言生成的局限性

Abstract: Assertion-based verification (ABV) is a key approach to checking whether a logic design complies with its architectural specifications. Existing assertion generation methods based on design specifications typically produce only top-level assertions, overlooking verification needs on the implementation details in the modules at the micro-architectural level, where design errors occur more frequently. To address this limitation, we present AssertMiner, a module-level assertion generation framework that leverages static information generated from abstract syntax tree (AST) to assist LLMs in mining assertions. Specifically, it performs AST-based structural extraction to derive the module call graph, I/O table, and dataflow graph, guiding the LLM to generate module-level specifications and mine module-level assertions. Our evaluation demonstrates that AssertMiner outperforms existing methods such as AssertLLM and Spec2Assertion in generating high-quality assertions for modules. When integrated with these methods, AssertMiner can enhance the structural coverage and significantly improve the error detection capability, enabling a more comprehensive and efficient verification process.

Abstract: The remarkable progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is foundation-ally linked to a concurrent revolution in computer architecture. As AI models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have grown in complexity, their massive computational demands have pushed traditional architectures to their limits. This paper provides a structured review of this co-evolution, analyzing the architectural landscape designed to accelerate modern AI workloads. We explore the dominant architectural paradigms Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Appli-cation-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), and Field-Programmable Gate Ar-rays (FPGAs) by breaking down their design philosophies, key features, and per-formance trade-offs. The core principles essential for performance and energy efficiency, including dataflow optimization, advanced memory hierarchies, spar-sity, and quantization, are analyzed. Furthermore, this paper looks ahead to emerging technologies such as Processing-in-Memory (PIM) and neuromorphic computing, which may redefine future computation. By synthesizing architec-tural principles with quantitative performance data from industry-standard benchmarks, this survey presents a comprehensive picture of the AI accelerator landscape. We conclude that AI and computer architecture are in a symbiotic relationship, where hardware-software co-design is no longer an optimization but a necessity for future progress in computing.

Abstract: The demand for computer in our daily lives has led to the proliferation of Datacenters that power indispensable many services. On the other hand, computing has become essential for some research for various scientific fields, that require Supercomputers with vast computing capabilities to produce results in reasonable time. The scale and complexity of these systems, compared to our day-to-day devices, are like comparing a cell to a living organism. To make them work properly, we need state-of-the-art technology and engineering, not just raw resources. Interconnecting the different computer nodes that make up a whole is a delicate task, as it can become the bottleneck for the whole infrastructure. In this work, we explore two aspects of the network: how to prevent degradation under heavy use with congestion control, and how to save energy when idle with power management; and how the two may interact.

Abstract: Massive multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication are key physical layer technologies in future wireless systems. Their deployment, however, is expected to incur excessive baseband processing hardware cost and power consumption. Beamspace processing leverages the channel sparsity at mmWave frequencies to reduce baseband processing complexity. In this paper, we review existing beamspace data detection algorithms and propose new algorithms as well as corresponding VLSI architectures that reduce data detection power. We present VLSI implementation results for the proposed architectures in a 22nm FDSOI process. Our results demonstrate that a fully-parallelized implementation of the proposed complex sparsity-adaptive equalizer (CSPADE) achieves up to 54% power savings compared to antenna-domain equalization. Furthermore, our fully-parallelized designs achieve the highest reported throughput among existing massive MIMO data detectors, while achieving better energy and area efficiency. We also present a sequential multiply-accumulate (MAC)-based architecture for CSPADE, which enables even higher power savings, i.e., up to 66%, compared to a MAC-based antenna-domain equalizer.

Abstract: Proof-Number Search is a best-first search algorithm with many successful applications, especially in game solving. As large-scale computing clusters become increasingly accessible, parallelization is a natural way to accelerate computation. However, existing parallel versions of Proof-Number Search are known to scale poorly on many CPU cores. Using two parallelized levels and shared information among workers, we present the first massively parallel version of Proof-Number Search that scales efficiently even on a large number of CPUs. We apply our solver, enhanced with Grundy numbers for reducing game trees, to the Sprouts game, a case study motivated by the long-standing Sprouts Conjecture. Our solver achieves a significantly improved 332.9$\times$ speedup when run on 1024 cores, enabling it to outperform the state-of-the-art Sprouts solver GLOP by four orders of magnitude in runtime and to generate proofs 1,000$\times$ more complex. Despite exponential growth in game tree size, our solver verified the Sprouts Conjecture for 42 new positions, nearly doubling the number of known outcomes.

Conclusion: MuSeR方法有效增强了LLM在医疗领域的上下文感知能力，通过自我精炼和知识蒸馏实现了性能的显著提升，为医疗AI应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks. However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%). Code and dataset will be released at https://muser-llm.github.io.

Conclusion: ProgRAG通过逐步分解和优化推理路径，有效解决了KG增强LLM中的检索和推理挑战，为复杂知识密集型任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but struggle with hallucinations and limited transparency. Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers. Experiments on three well-known datasets demonstrate that ProgRAG outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA, offering improved reliability and reasoning quality.

Abstract: Fake news detection methods based on writing style have achieved remarkable progress. However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy, effectively addressing the challenges of style sensitivity and LLM usability in fake news detection.

Abstract: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are critical to patient survival in emergencies, but first responders often face intense cognitive demands in high-stakes situations. AI cognitive assistants, acting as virtual partners, have the potential to ease this burden by supporting real-time data collection and decision making. In pursuit of this vision, we introduce EgoEMS, the first end-to-end, high-fidelity, multimodal, multiperson dataset capturing over 20 hours of realistic, procedural EMS activities from an egocentric view in 233 simulated emergency scenarios performed by 62 participants, including 46 EMS professionals. Developed in collaboration with EMS experts and aligned with national standards, EgoEMS is captured using an open-source, low-cost, and replicable data collection system and is annotated with keysteps, timestamped audio transcripts with speaker diarization, action quality metrics, and bounding boxes with segmentation masks. Emphasizing realism, the dataset includes responder-patient interactions reflecting real-world emergency dynamics. We also present a suite of benchmarks for real-time multimodal keystep recognition and action quality estimation, essential for developing AI support tools for EMS. We hope EgoEMS inspires the research community to push the boundaries of intelligent EMS systems and ultimately contribute to improved patient outcomes.

Abstract: Data synthesis for training large reasoning models offers a scalable alternative to limited, human-curated datasets, enabling the creation of high-quality data. However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain. Our code will be made publicly available here.

Abstract: Simulation-based testing has become a crucial complement to road testing for ensuring the safety of cyber physical systems (CPS). As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.

Abstract: This paper introduces the distributed Halpern Peaceman--Rachford (dHPR) method, an efficient algorithm for solving distributed convex composite optimization problems with non-smooth objectives, which achieves a non-ergodic $O(1/k)$ iteration complexity regarding Karush--Kuhn--Tucker residual. By leveraging the symmetric Gauss--Seidel decomposition, the dHPR effectively decouples the linear operators in the objective functions and consensus constraints while maintaining parallelizability and avoiding additional large proximal terms, leading to a decentralized implementation with provably fast convergence. The superior performance of dHPR is demonstrated through comprehensive numerical experiments on distributed LASSO, group LASSO, and $L_1$-regularized logistic regression problems.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of agent architectures and effectively identifying problematic agents when failures occur are crucial challenges in multi-agent systems (MAS). Advances in large language models (LLMs) have established LLM-based agents as a major branch of MAS, enabling major breakthroughs in complex problem solving and world modeling. However, the reliability implications of this shift remain largely unexplored. i.e., whether substituting traditional agents with LLM-based agents can effectively enhance the reliability of MAS. In this work, we investigate and quantify the reliability of LLM-based agents from the perspective of Byzantine fault tolerance. We observe that LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism when processing erroneous message flows, a characteristic that enables them to outperform traditional agents across different topological structures. Motivated by the results of the pilot experiment, we design CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to enhance the stability of MAS with different topologies. It capitalizes on the intrinsic reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLMs by employing a probe-based, weighted information flow transmission method to improve the reliability of LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-WBFT achieves superior performance across diverse network topologies under extreme Byzantine conditions (85.7\% fault rate). Notably, our approach surpasses traditional methods by attaining remarkable accuracy on various topologies and maintaining strong reliability in both mathematical reasoning and safety assessment tasks.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: VEDA是一个统一的SE(3)-等变框架，结合方差爆炸扩散和退火技术，高效生成构象准确的3D分子结构，在采样效率和几何精度之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在3D分子生成中面临的采样效率与构象精度之间的基本权衡问题。基于流的模型速度快但几何精度差，而去噪扩散模型精度高但采样慢。

Method: 提出VEDA框架：1）VE调度实现类似模拟退火的噪声注入；2）新的预处理方案协调SE(3)-等变网络与残差扩散目标；3）基于arcsin的调度器在关键区间集中采样。

Result: 在QM9和GEOM-DRUGS数据集上，VEDA仅需100个采样步骤就达到基于流模型的采样效率，实现最先进的价态稳定性和有效性。生成的结构极其稳定，GFN2-xTB优化中的中位能量变化仅1.72 kcal/mol。

Conclusion: VEDA证明，将VE扩散与SE(3)-等变架构进行原则性整合，可以同时实现高化学精度和计算效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for 3D molecular generation, but face a fundamental trade-off between sampling efficiency and conformational accuracy. While flow-based models are fast, they often produce geometrically inaccurate structures, as they have difficulty capturing the multimodal distributions of molecular conformations. In contrast, denoising diffusion models are more accurate but suffer from slow sampling, a limitation attributed to sub-optimal integration between diffusion dynamics and SE(3)-equivariant architectures. To address this, we propose VEDA, a unified SE(3)-equivariant framework that combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to efficiently generate conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures. Specifically, our key technical contributions include: (1) a VE schedule that enables noise injection functionally analogous to simulated annealing, improving 3D accuracy and reducing relaxation energy; (2) a novel preconditioning scheme that reconciles the coordinate-predicting nature of SE(3)-equivariant networks with a residual-based diffusion objective, and (3) a new arcsin-based scheduler that concentrates sampling in critical intervals of the logarithmic signal-to-noise ratio. On the QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets, VEDA matches the sampling efficiency of flow-based models, achieving state-of-the-art valency stability and validity with only 100 sampling steps. More importantly, VEDA's generated structures are remarkably stable, as measured by their relaxation energy during GFN2-xTB optimization. The median energy change is only 1.72 kcal/mol, significantly lower than the 32.3 kcal/mol from its architectural baseline, SemlaFlow. Our framework demonstrates that principled integration of VE diffusion with SE(3)-equivariant architectures can achieve both high chemical accuracy and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: Music Flamingo是一个专为音乐理解设计的大型音频语言模型，通过构建大规模数据集MF-Skills和MF-Think，结合强化学习训练，在10多个音乐理解基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频语言模型在音乐理解方面面临挑战，因为音乐具有动态、分层和信息密集的特性，且高质量音乐数据和标注稀缺，导致现有模型只能生成简短描述、回答浅层问题，在不同音乐文化中泛化能力有限。

Method: 1) 构建MF-Skills大规模数据集，包含丰富的描述和问答对；2) 在增强的Audio Flamingo 3骨干网络上微调；3) 引入后训练方法：先用MF-Think链式思维数据集冷启动，再进行基于GRPO的强化学习。

Result: 在10多个音乐理解和推理基准测试中取得最先进结果，展示了从表层识别向分层、类人音乐感知的转变。

Conclusion: Music Flamingo为社区提供了基准和基础，推动下一代模型能够像人类一样有意义地参与音乐互动。

Abstract: We introduce Music Flamingo, a novel large audio-language model designed to advance music (including song) understanding in foundational audio models. While audio-language research has progressed rapidly, music remains challenging due to its dynamic, layered, and information-dense nature. Progress has been further limited by the difficulty of scaling open audio understanding models, primarily because of the scarcity of high-quality music data and annotations. As a result, prior models are restricted to producing short, high-level captions, answering only surface-level questions, and showing limited generalization across diverse musical cultures. To address these challenges, we curate MF-Skills, a large-scale dataset labeled through a multi-stage pipeline that yields rich captions and question-answer pairs covering harmony, structure, timbre, lyrics, and cultural context. We fine-tune an enhanced Audio Flamingo 3 backbone on MF-Skills and further strengthen multiple skills relevant to music understanding. To improve the model's reasoning abilities, we introduce a post-training recipe: we first cold-start with MF-Think, a novel chain-of-thought dataset grounded in music theory, followed by GRPO-based reinforcement learning with custom rewards. Music Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art results across 10+ benchmarks for music understanding and reasoning, establishing itself as a generalist and musically intelligent audio-language model. Beyond strong empirical results, Music Flamingo sets a new standard for advanced music understanding by demonstrating how models can move from surface-level recognition toward layered, human-like perception of songs. We believe this work provides both a benchmark and a foundation for the community to build the next generation of models that engage with music as meaningfully as humans do.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社交媒体上虚假信息如何通过人类认知偏见、情感和身份驱动推理而传播，需要模拟用户层面的偏见机制。

Method: 建立LLM角色作为合成代理，模拟用户偏见和信任启发式；采用审计-节点框架，让角色重写新闻内容，通过问答审计器追踪事实保真度；定义虚假信息指数和传播率来量化事实退化。

Result: 实验显示身份和意识形态角色是虚假信息加速器，尤其在政治、营销和技术领域；专家角色能保持事实稳定；早期失真后，异质角色互动会迅速将虚假信息升级为宣传级失真。

Conclusion: LLM既能模拟人类偏见，又能作为审计器追踪信息保真度；该框架为研究、模拟和缓解数字生态系统中的虚假信息传播提供了可解释的实证方法。

Abstract: Misinformation on social media thrives on surprise, emotion, and identity-driven reasoning, often amplified through human cognitive biases. To investigate these mechanisms, we model large language model (LLM) personas as synthetic agents that mimic user-level biases, ideological alignments, and trust heuristics. Within this setup, we introduce an auditor--node framework to simulate and analyze how misinformation evolves as it circulates through networks of such agents. News articles are propagated across networks of persona-conditioned LLM nodes, each rewriting received content. A question--answering-based auditor then measures factual fidelity at every step, offering interpretable, claim-level tracking of misinformation drift. We formalize a misinformation index and a misinformation propagation rate to quantify factual degradation across homogeneous and heterogeneous branches of up to 30 sequential rewrites. Experiments with 21 personas across 10 domains reveal that identity- and ideology-based personas act as misinformation accelerators, especially in politics, marketing, and technology. By contrast, expert-driven personas preserve factual stability. Controlled-random branch simulations further show that once early distortions emerge, heterogeneous persona interactions rapidly escalate misinformation to propaganda-level distortion. Our taxonomy of misinformation severity -- spanning factual errors, lies, and propaganda -- connects observed drift to established theories in misinformation studies. These findings demonstrate the dual role of LLMs as both proxies for human-like biases and as auditors capable of tracing information fidelity. The proposed framework provides an interpretable, empirically grounded approach for studying, simulating, and mitigating misinformation diffusion in digital ecosystems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TawPipe是一种拓扑感知的权重流水线并行方法，通过利用分布式集群中的分层带宽来提高通信效率，解决了传统流水线并行中激活通信开销大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型语言模型受到设备内存限制和设备间通信成本的制约。传统流水线并行虽然缓解了内存压力，但存在激活通信开销随序列长度线性增长的问题，限制了长上下文训练的效率。

Method: TawPipe通过以下方式优化通信效率：(1)基于拓扑对设备进行分组，优化节点内集合通信和节点间点对点通信；(2)为每个设备分配固定的模型权重和梯度分片，避免冗余传输；(3)将通信与计算重叠以隐藏延迟。

Result: 在24个GPU上使用LLaMA风格模型进行的广泛实验表明，TawPipe相比最先进的基线方法实现了更高的吞吐量和可扩展性。

Conclusion: TawPipe通过将大部分通信限制在节点边界内，显著减少了跨节点流量，在训练大型语言模型时提供了优越的通信效率和性能表现。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by limited device memory and costly inter-device communication. Although pipeline parallelism alleviates memory pressure by partitioning models across devices, it incurs activation communication overhead that scales linearly with sequence length, limiting efficiency in long-context training. Recent weight-passing approaches (e.g., WeiPipe) mitigate this by transmitting model weights instead of activations, but suffer from redundant peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers and underutilized intra-node bandwidth. We propose TawPipe--topology-aware weight pipeline parallelism, which exploits hierarchical bandwidth in distributed clusters for improved communication efficiency. TawPipe: (i) groups devices based on topology to optimize intra-node collective and inter-node P2P communication; (ii) assigns each device a fixed shard of model weights and gradients, avoiding redundant transfers; and (iii) overlaps communication with computation to hide latency. Unlike global collective operations used in fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP), TawPipe confines most communication within node boundaries, significantly reducing cross-node traffic. Extensive experiments on up to 24 GPUs with LLaMA-style models show that TawPipe achieves superior throughput and scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的验证表明，SMoFi能持续提升全局模型准确性（最高7.1%）和收敛速度（最高10.25倍）。

Conclusion: SMoFi特别适用于资源受限环境下的模型训练，在客户端数量更多、学习模型更深时效果更显著。

Abstract: Split Federated Learning is a system-efficient federated learning paradigm that leverages the rich computing resources at a central server to train model partitions. Data heterogeneity across silos, however, presents a major challenge undermining the convergence speed and accuracy of the global model. This paper introduces Step-wise Momentum Fusion (SMoFi), an effective and lightweight framework that counteracts gradient divergence arising from data heterogeneity by synchronizing the momentum buffers across server-side optimizers. To control gradient divergence over the training process, we design a staleness-aware alignment mechanism that imposes constraints on gradient updates of the server-side submodel at each optimization step. Extensive validations on multiple real-world datasets show that SMoFi consistently improves global model accuracy (up to 7.1%) and convergence speed (up to 10.25$\times$). Furthermore, SMoFi has a greater impact with more clients involved and deeper learning models, making it particularly suitable for model training in resource-constrained contexts.

Method: FedSTGD包含联邦非线性计算分解模块来近似复杂图操作，图节点嵌入增强模块缓解分解带来的性能下降，通过客户端-服务器集体学习协议将动态空间依赖学习任务分解为轻量级可并行子任务。

Conclusion: FedSTGD能够有效建模和重构联邦学习中的动态客户端间空间依赖关系，在保护数据隐私的同时实现接近集中式方法的性能，对超参数变化具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are powerful tools for modeling complex dependencies in traffic time series. However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于有向二分图编码器的自动化ICD编码方法，通过建模常见代码和罕见代码之间的细粒度共现关系，利用LLM生成代码描述来增强表示，在长尾分布下显著提升了Macro-F1性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化ICD编码面临大规模标签空间（10,000-20,000个代码）和长尾分布问题，许多罕见代码缺乏足够的训练数据，需要有效利用代码间的共现关系来解决数据稀疏性问题。

Method: 构建有向二分图编码器，将常见代码和罕见代码作为不相交节点集，边只从常见代码指向罕见代码。基于条件概率定义连接偏置，通过共现编码注入到注意力模块中，利用LLM生成代码描述来增强初始嵌入。

Conclusion: 通过建模代码间的细粒度共现关系并利用LLM增强表示，能够有效解决ICD编码中的长尾分布问题，为罕见代码提供更好的表示学习。

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding aims to assign multiple disease codes to clinical documents, constituting a crucial multi-label text classification task in healthcare informatics. However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system. Experiments on three automated ICD coding benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with particularly notable improvements in Macro-F1, which is the key metric for long-tail classification.

*Yuping Yan,Yuhan Xie,Yuanshuai Li,Yingchao Yu,Lingjuan Lyu,Yaochu Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了OutSafe-Bench，这是首个最全面的多模态内容安全评估测试套件，包含18,000+双语文本提示、4,500张图像、450个音频和450个视频，涵盖9个关键风险类别，并引入了MCRS指标和FairScore评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)日益融入日常工具和智能代理，对其可能输出不安全内容（如有毒语言、偏见图像、隐私侵犯和有害错误信息）的担忧不断增加。现有安全基准在模态覆盖和性能评估方面高度受限。

Method: 构建大规模多模态数据集，开发多维交叉风险评分(MCRS)来评估不同风险类别间的重叠和相关性，并提出FairScore可解释自动多评审加权聚合框架，选择表现最佳的模型作为自适应评审团。

Result: 对9个最先进的MLLMs进行评估，发现存在持续且显著的安全漏洞。

Conclusion: MLLMs迫切需要强大的安全防护措施，OutSafe-Bench为多模态时代的内容安全评估提供了全面基准。

Abstract: Since Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly being integrated into everyday tools and intelligent agents, growing concerns have arisen regarding their possible output of unsafe contents, ranging from toxic language and biased imagery to privacy violations and harmful misinformation. Current safety benchmarks remain highly limited in both modality coverage and performance evaluations, often neglecting the extensive landscape of content safety. In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework. FairScore selects top-performing models as adaptive juries, thereby mitigating biases from single-model judgments and enhancing overall evaluation reliability. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, underscoring the pressing need for robust safeguards in MLLMs.

TL;DR: AgentEvolver是一个自进化智能体系统，利用LLM的语义理解和推理能力驱动自主智能体学习，通过自我提问、自我导航和自我归因机制解决传统RL方法成本高、效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的自主智能体开发成本高、效率低，需要手动构建任务数据集和大量随机探索的RL流程，导致数据构建成本高、探索效率低、样本利用率差。

Method: 提出三个协同机制：自我提问（好奇心驱动任务生成）、自我导航（经验重用和混合策略指导）、自我归因（基于贡献度分配差异化奖励）。

Result: 初步实验表明，与传统RL基线相比，AgentEvolver实现了更高效的探索、更好的样本利用率和更快的适应能力。

Conclusion: AgentEvolver通过统一框架实现了智能体能力的可扩展、成本效益高和持续改进。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly enhance human productivity by reasoning, using tools, and executing complex tasks in diverse environments. However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities. Preliminary experiments indicate that AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.

*Rishi Singhal,Jung-Eun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LayerNorm在Pre-LayerNorm模型中稳定学习，在Post-LayerNorm模型中影响记忆化，消除其参数会加剧Pre模型的记忆化但缓解Post模型的记忆化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LayerNorm在Pre-和Post-LayerNorm transformers中对学习和记忆化的影响，目前这方面的作用尚不明确。

Method: 通过分析13个模型在6个视觉和语言数据集上的表现，研究LayerNorm参数消除对Pre和Post模型的影响，特别关注不同层LayerNorm的作用。

Result: Pre-LayerNorm模型中LayerNorm对稳定学习至关重要，Post-LayerNorm模型中LayerNorm影响记忆化；消除LayerNorm参数会加剧Pre模型的记忆化但缓解Post模型的记忆化；早期层的LayerNorm最为关键。

Conclusion: LayerNorm在transformer中通过不同机制影响学习和记忆化，为理解transformer架构提供了新视角。

Abstract: Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) is one of the fundamental components in transformers that stabilizes training and improves optimization. In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.

TL;DR: 提出了一个负责任强化学习(RRL)框架，将情感理解和伦理约束整合到顺序决策过程中，用于医疗和行为支持领域的个性化系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的个性化决策系统通常依赖静态规则或参与度最大化启发式方法，忽视了用户的情感背景和伦理约束，可能导致推荐不敏感或不安全的干预措施。

Method: 将个性化建模为约束马尔可夫决策过程(CMDP)，引入多目标奖励函数平衡短期行为参与和长期用户福祉，定义情感感知的状态表示，并可使用任何RL算法增强安全约束。

Result: 提出了一个概念框架，将同理心和责任操作化到机器学习策略优化中，连接了安全RL、情感计算和负责任AI。

Conclusion: 该框架为行为健康、教育和数字治疗等领域的人本应用提供了方法基础，旨在启动关于情感感知和可信个性化系统的伦理对齐强化学习方法讨论。

Abstract: Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.

TL;DR: PRISM是一个数据集蒸馏框架，通过解耦架构先验，使用不同教师模型分别监督logit匹配和正则化目标，生成更丰富多样的合成数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集蒸馏方法通常继承单一教师模型的归纳偏差，随着数据集规模增大，这种偏差会导致生成过于平滑、同质化的样本，降低类内多样性并限制泛化能力。

Method: PRISM框架将logit匹配和正则化目标解耦，分别用不同架构的教师模型进行监督：主模型用于logits，随机子集用于批量归一化对齐。还引入了可扩展的跨类批次形成方案进行快速并行合成。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，PRISM在低中IPC机制下持续优于单一教师方法（如SRe2L）和近期多教师变体（如G-VBSM）。生成的数据显示出显著更丰富的类内多样性，特征间余弦相似度明显下降。

Conclusion: PRISM通过解耦架构先验有效解决了数据集蒸馏中的归纳偏差问题，生成了更丰富多样的合成数据，在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) promises compact yet faithful synthetic data, but existing approaches often inherit the inductive bias of a single teacher model. As dataset size increases, this bias drives generation toward overly smooth, homogeneous samples, reducing intra-class diversity and limiting generalization. We present PRISM (PRIors from diverse Source Models), a framework that disentangles architectural priors during synthesis. PRISM decouples the logit-matching and regularization objectives, supervising them with different teacher architectures: a primary model for logits and a stochastic subset for batch-normalization (BN) alignment. On ImageNet-1K, PRISM consistently and reproducibly outperforms single-teacher methods (e.g., SRe2L) and recent multi-teacher variants (e.g., G-VBSM) at low- and mid-IPC regimes. The generated data also show significantly richer intra-class diversity, as reflected by a notable drop in cosine similarity between features. We further analyze teacher selection strategies (pre- vs. intra-distillation) and introduce a scalable cross-class batch formation scheme for fast parallel synthesis. Code will be released after the review period.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 暴露当前可解释性方法的关键漏洞，揭示其在安全关键应用中的可靠性问题。攻击仅需模型预测和解释结果，无需访问模型内部。

Method: 基于后验可解释性方法（显著图、积分梯度、DeepLIFT SHAP）生成对抗攻击，在单步中修改原始解释而不改变预测概率。

Result: 攻击能够在不改变预测概率的情况下导致解释结果显著不同，通过平均绝对差和结构相似性指数验证了攻击的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法低要求的特点暴露了当前可解释性方法的严重脆弱性，对安全关键应用中的可靠性提出了担忧。

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability methods are a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that aim to provide a reason for why a model behaves in a certain way. In this paper, we show a new black-box model-agnostic adversarial attack for post-hoc explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), particularly in the image domain. The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet. The results show that our attacks could lead to dramatically different explanations without changing the predictive probabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our attack, compute the induced change based on the explanation with mean absolute difference, and verify the closeness of the original image and the corrupted one with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).

Conclusion: 对八个最先进生成模型的分析为理解模型如何违反物理约束提供了宝贵见解，为未来模型改进铺平了道路。

Abstract: Although recent generative models are remarkably capable of producing instruction-following and realistic outputs, they remain prone to notable physical plausibility failures. Though critical in applications, these physical plausibility errors often escape detection by existing evaluation methods. Furthermore, no framework exists for automatically identifying and interpreting specific physical error patterns in natural language, preventing targeted model improvements. We introduce Matryoshka Transcoders, a novel framework for the automatic discovery and interpretation of physical plausibility features in generative models. Our approach extends the Matryoshka representation learning paradigm to transcoder architectures, enabling hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels. By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches. We utilize the discovered visual patterns to establish a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models. Our analysis of eight state-of-the-art generative models provides valuable insights into how these models fail to follow physical constraints, paving the way for further model improvements.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用数据内在维度（ID）作为易于计算、无需模型的类别不平衡度量方法，在五个不同数据集上证明ID比基于样本数量的重加权和重采样技术表现更好，且与样本数量结合能进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的类别不平衡量化方法仅考虑各类别样本数量，忽略了冗余样本的存在和类别间学习难度的内在差异。而复杂的度量方法如训练损失和不确定性需要训练机器学习模型。

Method: 使用数据内在维度（ID）作为类别不平衡的度量指标，这是一种易于计算且无需模型的方法，可以无缝集成到各种不平衡缓解方法中。

Result: 在五个具有不同不平衡比例的数据集上的实验结果显示，ID方法始终优于文献中基于样本数量的重加权和重采样技术。

Conclusion: 数据内在维度是比样本数量更有效的类别不平衡度量方法，且与样本数量结合使用能获得更好的性能。

Abstract: Imbalance in classification tasks is commonly quantified by the cardinalities of examples across classes. This, however, disregards the presence of redundant examples and inherent differences in the learning difficulties of classes. Alternatively, one can use complex measures such as training loss and uncertainty, which, however, depend on training a machine learning model. Our paper proposes using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as an easy-to-compute, model-free measure of imbalance that can be seamlessly incorporated into various imbalance mitigation methods. Our results across five different datasets with a diverse range of imbalance ratios show that ID consistently outperforms cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling techniques used in the literature. Moreover, we show that combining ID with cardinality can further improve performance. Code: https://github.com/cagries/IDIM.

Conclusion: Pk-IOTA能够有效解决OPC UA部署中的安全挑战，提供了一种高效、可扩展的证书管理解决方案。

Abstract: The OPC UA protocol is becoming the de facto standard for Industry 4.0 machine-to-machine communication. It stands out as one of the few industrial protocols that provide robust security features designed to prevent attackers from manipulating and damaging critical infrastructures. However, prior works showed that significant challenges still exists to set up secure OPC UA deployments in practice, mainly caused by the complexity of certificate management in industrial scenarios and the inconsistent implementation of security features across industrial OPC UA devices. In this paper, we present Pk-IOTA, an automated solution designed to secure OPC UA communications by integrating programmable data plane switches for in-network certificate validation and leveraging the IOTA Tangle for decen- tralized certificate distribution. Our evaluation is performed on a physical testbed representing a real-world industrial scenario and shows that Pk-IOTA introduces a minimal overhead while providing a scalable and tamper-proof mechanism for OPC UA certificate management.

Motivation: 现有的交通标志识别系统对抗性攻击存在视觉可检测性或实施限制的问题，表明TSR系统中存在未探索的漏洞表面。

Method: 开发逆反射模拟方法，使用黑盒优化最大化攻击效果，利用逆反射材料仅在受害者头灯照射下激活的特性。

Result: ARP在35米动态场景中达到≥93.4%成功率，对商业TSR系统在真实条件下达到≥60%成功率，隐蔽性得分比先前贴片攻击高≥1.9%。

Conclusion: ARP攻击在保持与良性标志几乎相同隐蔽性的同时实现了高攻击成功率，提出的DPR Shield防御方法对停止标志和限速标志达到≥75%的防御成功率。

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition plays a critical role in ensuring safe and efficient transportation of autonomous vehicles but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks using stickers or laser projections. While existing attack vectors demonstrate security concerns, they suffer from visual detectability or implementation constraints, suggesting unexplored vulnerability surfaces in TSR systems. We introduce the Adversarial Retroreflective Patch (ARP), a novel attack vector that combines the high deployability of patch attacks with the stealthiness of laser projections by utilizing retroreflective materials activated only under victim headlight illumination. We develop a retroreflection simulation method and employ black-box optimization to maximize attack effectiveness. ARP achieves $\geq$93.4\% success rate in dynamic scenarios at 35 meters and $\geq$60\% success rate against commercial TSR systems in real-world conditions. Our user study demonstrates that ARP attacks maintain near-identical stealthiness to benign signs while achieving $\geq$1.9\% higher stealthiness scores than previous patch attacks. We propose the DPR Shield defense, employing strategically placed polarized filters, which achieves $\geq$75\% defense success rates for stop signs and speed limit signs against micro-prism patches.
