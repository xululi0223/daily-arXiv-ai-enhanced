The adoption of edge artificial intelligence, embedding AI directly into edge devices, is rapidly growing. Despite the implementation of guardrails and safety mechanisms, security vulnerabilities and challenges have become increasingly prevalent in this domain, posing a significant barrier to the practical deployment and safety of AI systems. This paper proposes an agentic AI safety architecture that leverages 3D to integrate a dedicated safety layer. It introduces an adaptive AI safety infrastructure capable of dynamically learning and mitigating attacks against the AI system. The system leverages the inherent advantages of co-location with the edge computing hardware to continuously monitor, detect and proactively mitigate threats to the AI system. The integration of local processing and learning capabilities enhances resilience against emerging network-based attacks while simultaneously improving system reliability, modularity, and performance, all with minimal cost and 3D integration overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5f0fAI\u5b89\u5168\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u4e13\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u7f13\u89e3\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u62a4AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u514d\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u548c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u75283D\u96c6\u6210\u6280\u672f\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u786c\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u4e13\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u5730\u5904\u7406\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u7f13\u89e3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u65b0\u5174\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u548c3D\u96c6\u6210\u5f00\u9500\u6700\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5f0fAI\u5b89\u5168\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u672c\u5730\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u5a01\u80c1\u7f13\u89e3\u3002"}}

Our approach combines the MLIR OpenMP dialect with a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) dialect to provide a portable compilation flow targeting FPGAs. Unlike prior OpenMP FPGA efforts that rely on custom compilers, by contrast we integrate with MLIR and so support any MLIR-compatible front end, demonstrated here with Flang. Building upon a range of existing MLIR building blocks significantly reduces the effort required and demonstrates the composability benefits of the MLIR ecosystem.

DC flexibility (a.k.a. load adaptation) is a key to reducing DC carbon emissions by improving grid renewable absorption.\n  DC flexibility can be created, without disturbing datacenter capacity by decoupling a datacenter's power capacity and grid load with a collection of energy resources. Because decoupling can be costly, we study how to best distribute and manage decoupling to maximize benefits for all. Key considerations include site variation and datacenter-grid cooperation.\n  We first define and compute the power and energy needs of datacenter load decoupling, and then we evaluate designed distribution and management approaches. Evaluation shows that optimized distribution can deliver >98% of the potential grid carbon reduction with 70% of the total decoupling need. For management, DC-grid cooperation (2-way sharing and control vs. 1-way info sharing) enables 1.4x grid carbon reduction. Finally, we show that decoupling may be economically viable, as on average datacenters can get power cost and carbon emissions benefits greater than their local costs of decoupling.

This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization.

Four major cloud providers by market share AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) are compared across Intel, AMD, and ARM general purpose instance types under both on-demand and one-year discounted pricing. AWS consistently delivers the shortest runtime in all three instance types, yet charges a premium, especially for on-demand usage. OCI emerges as the most economical option across all CPU families, although it generally runs workloads more slowly than AWS. Azure often exhibits mid-range performance and cost, while GCP presents a mixed profile: it sees a notable boost when moving from Intel to AMD. On the other hand, its ARM instance is more than twice as slow as its own AMD offering and remains significantly more expensive. AWS's internal comparisons reveal that its ARM instance can outperform its Intel and AMD siblings by up to 49 percent in runtime. These findings highlight how instance choices and provider selection can yield substantial variations in both runtime and price, indicating that workload priorities, whether raw speed or cost minimization, should guide decisions on instance types.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u4e91\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\uff08AWS\u3001Azure\u3001GCP\u3001OCI\uff09\u5728\u865a\u62df\u5316\u4e91\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e2d\u7684HPC\u98ce\u683cCPU\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SPEC ACCEL\u5957\u4ef6\u7684OpenMP\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86Intel\u3001AMD\u548cARM\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7c7b\u578b\u5728\u6309\u9700\u548c\u4e00\u5e74\u6298\u6263\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2dHPC\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u6839\u636e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff08\u539f\u59cb\u901f\u5ea6\u6216\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4e91\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SPEC ACCEL\u5957\u4ef6\u7684OpenMP\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5728AWS\u3001Azure\u3001GCP\u548cOCI\u56db\u79cd\u4e91\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5Intel\u3001AMD\u548cARM\u901a\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6309\u9700\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u4e00\u5e74\u6298\u6263\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "AWS\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u79cd\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7c7b\u578b\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u77ed\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u6536\u8d39\u8f83\u9ad8\uff1bOCI\u5728\u6240\u6709CPU\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\u662f\u6700\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u8f83\u6162\uff1bAzure\u901a\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u4e2d\u7b49\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff1bGCP\u4eceIntel\u5207\u6362\u5230AMD\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u5176ARM\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6bd4\u81ea\u5df1\u7684AMD\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6162\u4e24\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u4e14\u66f4\u6602\u8d35\uff1bAWS\u7684ARM\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u6bd4\u5176Intel\u548cAMD\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5feb\u8fbe49%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u9009\u62e9\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0a\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff08\u539f\u59cb\u901f\u5ea6\u6216\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff09\u5e94\u6307\u5bfc\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7c7b\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets.

However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design.

In this paper, based on our experiences building the Advanced Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (APPFL) framework, we present our vision for an enterprise-grade, privacy-preserving FL framework designed to scale seamlessly across computing environments. We identify several key capabilities that such a framework must provide: (1) Scalable local simulation and prototyping to accelerate experimentation and algorithm design; (2) seamless transition from simulation to deployment; (3) distributed deployment across diverse, real-world infrastructures, from personal devices to cloud clusters and HPC systems; (4) multi-level abstractions that balance ease of use and research flexibility; and (5) comprehensive privacy and security through techniques such as differential privacy, secure aggregation, robust authentication, and confidential computing.

This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\\sim$90\\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\\sim$80\\% of trajectories under challenging conditions.

To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward.

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fr\u00e9chet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

One of the greatest advantages of this is that concurrency and synchronization is manged entirely in the userspace, omitting heavy-weight system calls. However, we find that state-of-the-art userspace synchronization primitives approach synchronization in the userspace from the perspective of kernel-level scheduling. This introduces unnecessary delays on the critical path of the application, limiting throughput. In this paper, we re-think synchronization for tasks that are scheduled entirely in the userspace (e.g., coroutines, fibers, etc.). We develop Combine-and-Exchange Scheduling (CES), a novel scheduling approach that ensures contended critical sections stay on the same thread of execution while parallelizable work is evenly spread across the remaining threads. We show that our approach can be applied to many existing languages and libraries, resulting in 3-fold performance improvements in application benchmarks as well as 8-fold performance improvements in microbenchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7a7a\u95f4\u540c\u6b65\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5CES\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u534f\u7a0b\u7b49\u7528\u6237\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u4e34\u754c\u533a\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u6267\u884c\u7ebf\u7a0b\u4e0a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5747\u5300\u5206\u914d\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u7ebf\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u5e7f\u6cdb\u652f\u6301\u534f\u7a0b\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5e76\u884c\u6216\u5f02\u6b65\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u7a7a\u95f4\u540c\u6b65\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u91cd\u91cf\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u7528\u3002\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7528\u6237\u7a7a\u95f4\u540c\u6b65\u539f\u8bed\u4ecd\u91c7\u7528\u5185\u6838\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Combine-and-Exchange Scheduling (CES)\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u533a\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6267\u884c\u7ebf\u7a0b\u4e0a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u7ebf\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u5e93\uff0c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b03\u500d\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b08\u500d\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "CES\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u534f\u7a0b\u7b49\u7528\u6237\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u53d1\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Soft Preference Learning\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026KL\u6563\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u71b5\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u9879\uff0c\u6765\u89e3\u51b3RLHF\u548cDPO\u7b49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982RLHF\u548cDPO\uff09\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u6587\u672c\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u7a84\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u89c2\u70b9\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSoft Preference Learning\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u6784KL\u6563\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u71b5\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u9879\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9LLM\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4ece\u80fd\u529b\u89d2\u5ea6\u770b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Soft Preference Learning\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684LLM\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u91cd\u590d\u91c7\u6837\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u4ece\u5bf9\u9f50\u89d2\u5ea6\u770b\uff0c\u80fd\u4ee3\u8868\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u89c2\u70b9\u5e76\u663e\u793a\u6539\u8fdb\u7684logit\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "Soft Preference Learning\u662f\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6\u6e29\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

Lock-free concurrent queue with coordination-free memory reclamation", "summary": "The queue is conceptually one of the simplest data structures-a basic FIFO container. However, ensuring correctness in the presence of concurrency makes existing lock-free implementations significantly more complex than their original form. Coordination mechanisms introduced to prevent hazards such as ABA, use-after-free, and unsafe reclamation often dominate the design, overshadowing the queue itself. Many schemes compromise strict FIFO ordering, unbounded capacity, or lock-free progress to mask coordination overheads. Yet the true source of complexity lies in the pursuit of infinite protection against reclamation hazards--theoretically sound but impractical and costly. This pursuit not only drives unnecessary complexity but also creates a protection paradox where excessive protection reduces system resilience rather than improving it. While such costs may be tolerable in conventional workloads, the AI era has shifted the paradigm: training and inference pipelines involve hundreds to thousands of concurrent threads per node, and at this scale, protection and coordination overheads dominate, often far heavier than the basic queue operations themselves.\n  This paper introduces Cyclic Memory Protection (CMP), a coordination-free queue that preserves strict FIFO semantics, unbounded capacity, and lock-free progress while restoring simplicity. CMP reclaims the strict FIFO that other approaches sacrificed through bounded protection windows that provide practical reclamation guarantees.

Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios.

Existing FPGA and CGRA programming models emphasize loop scheduling but overlook the unique capabilities of spatial dataflow architectures, particularly efficient dataflow over regular grids and intricate routing management.\n  We present SPADA, a programming language that provides precise control over data placement, dataflow patterns, and asynchronous operations while abstracting architecture-specific low-level details. We introduce a rigorous dataflow semantics framework for SPADA that defines routing correctness, data races, and deadlocks. Additionally, we design and implement a compiler targeting Cerebras CSL with multi-level lowering.\n  SPADA serves as both a high-level programming interface and an intermediate representation for domain-specific languages (DSLs), which we demonstrate with the GT4Py stencil DSL. SPADA enables developers to express complex parallel patterns -- including pipelined reductions and multi-dimensional stencils -- in 6--8x less code than CSL with near-ideal weak scaling across three orders of magnitude.

In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \\texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \\texttt{GPT} and \\texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \\texttt{Gemini} and \\texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience.

However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise.

However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario.

However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction.

While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime).

This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment.

Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data.

Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26)", "summary": "We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients.

In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement.

In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster.

Ben Hamza"], "title": "Adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold network for 3D human pose estimation", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Graph convolutional network (GCN)-based methods have shown strong performance in 3D human pose estimation by leveraging the natural graph structure of the human skeleton. However, their local receptive field limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies essential for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities. They also exhibit spectral bias, which prioritizes low-frequency components while struggling to model high-frequency details. In this paper, we introduce PoseKAN, an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), framework that extends KANs to graph-based learning for 2D-to-3D pose lifting from a single image. Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations.

However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements!

Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features. In this work, we introduce SIFT-Graph, a multimodal defense framework that enhances the robustness of traditional vision models by aggregating structurally meaningful features extracted from raw images using both handcrafted and learned modalities. Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model.

Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "DT-NVS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ec5\u56fe\u50cf\u635f\u5931\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5c0f\u76f8\u673a\u79fb\u52a8\u6216\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6446\u8131\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u65e5\u5e38\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDT-NVS\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a3D\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u4e3b\u5e72\u3002\u5bf9transformer\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u505a\u51fa\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a3D\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u566a\u58f0\u8f93\u5165\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ea4\u6362\u53c2\u8003\u5e27\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u62103D\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u76843D\u611f\u77e5\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6240\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "DT-NVS\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u65e5\u5e38\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows.

However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes.

However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

Extant contrastive learning networks, whose two encoders often implicitly interact with each other by parameter sharing or momentum updating, may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of the positive pairs to extract clustering features from input data. To explicitly fuse the learned features of positive pairs, we design a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) based on the excellent feature learning ability of Vision Transformers (ViT). Firstly, two preprocessed augmentions as positive pairs are separately fed into two shared-weight ViTs, then their output features are fused to input into a larger ViT. Secondly, the learned features are split into a pair of new augmented positive samples and passed to the next FAVBs, enabling multiple fusion and augmention through MFAVBs operations. Finally, the learned features are projected into both instance-level and clustering-level spaces to calculate the cross-entropy loss, followed by parameter updates by backpropagation to finalize the training process.

To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation.

Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \\& Eosin (H\\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task.

While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f15\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u4e0eLLM\u751f\u6210\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc71000\u6b21\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u51e0\u4e4e\u88ab\u9010\u5b57\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u800c\u5f15\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u4f4e\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u5f15\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5f15\u7528\u9891\u7387\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdLLM\u751f\u6210\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4\u751f\u6210100\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5f15\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6bd4\u8f83\u751f\u6210\u5f15\u7528\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5f15\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u8d85\u8fc7\u7ea61000\u6b21\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u51e0\u4e4e\u88ab\u9010\u5b57\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1b\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5f15\u7528\u8bba\u6587\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u4f3c\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u9ad8\u5f15\u7528\u8bba\u6587\u51e0\u4e4e\u88ab\u9010\u5b57\u4fdd\u7559\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f15\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification.

Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \\$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0eLLM\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u6587\u6863\u5e03\u5c40\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u52a0\u6743\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u6863\u5e03\u5c40\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u7136\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6240\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528OCR-LLM\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u63a8\u65ad\u6587\u6863\u5c42\u6b21\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u65b9\u5dee\u878d\u5408\u5c06\u6559\u5e08\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0eLLM\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u70bc\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728PubLayNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u75285%\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff1a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7SwiftFormer\u8fbe\u523088.2\u00b10.3 AP\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408LayoutLMv3\u8fbe\u523089.7\u00b10.4 AP\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60(89.1\u00b10.4 AP)\u5e76\u5339\u914d\u9700\u89811\u4ebf+\u9875\u9762\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684UDOP(89.8 AP)\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u67b6\u6784\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u878d\u5408\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u6587\u6863\u5e03\u5c40\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality.

In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators.

Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%).

However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP).

Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence.

Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins.

While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments.

While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a \"lossy compressor\", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch\", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability.

However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs.

NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy.

Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eHausdorff\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684FGM-HD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684HD\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cHD\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b(FGMs)\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u65b9\u9762\u5f88\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3FGMs\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684HD\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u9884\u6d4bHD\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eHD\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5355\u8c03\u52a8\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff1b3) \u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528HD\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u9009\u62e9\u51e0\u4f55\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFGM-HD\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u59cbFGMs\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8639%\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5c06HD\u5f15\u5165FGM\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aFGM\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding.

We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency.

However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale.

While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to \"identity mapping\", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid \"identity mapping\" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection.

However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance.

Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms.

A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly.

A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow.

Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival).

Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground.

We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained.

Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6ce8\u5165rollouts\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u6700\u7ec8\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8d1f\u5956\u52b1\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bda\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u65e2\u80fd\u56de\u7b54\u53ef\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u524d\u63d0\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u6b65\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u8fb9\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u6848\u4f8b\uff1b\u63d0\u51faAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728rollouts\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1bAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9632\u6b62\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bda\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches exhibit several limitations:(1)they primarily rely on static kernels to augment feature information, lacking adaptive mechanisms to extract features at varying resolutions dynamically;(2)temporal guidance is insufficient, leading to suboptimal modeling of long-range spatiotemporal dependencies; and(3)the quadratic computational cost of attention mechanisms is often overlooked, limiting efficiency in practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose USF-Net, a Unified Spatiotemporal Fusion Network that integrates adaptive large-kernel convolutions and a low-complexity attention mechanism, combining temporal flow information within an encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, the encoder employs three basic layers to extract features. Followed by the USTM, which comprises:(1)a SiB equipped with a SSM that dynamically captures multi-scale contextual information, and(2)a TiB featuring a TAM that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In addition, a DSM with a TGM is introduced to enable unified modeling of temporally guided spatiotemporal dependencies. On the decoder side, a DUM is employed to address the common \"ghosting effect.\" It utilizes the initial temporal state as an attention operator to preserve critical motion signatures. As a key contribution, we also introduce and release the ASI-CIS dataset.

During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "C\u00b3TG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u914d\u5bf9LLM\u4e0e\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a0\u6743KL\u6563\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574token\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u89e3\u51b3\u5c5e\u6027\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faC\u00b3TG\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u5c06LLM\u4e0e17\u4e2a\u53ef\u7528\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u9700\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6743KL\u6563\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574token\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5206\u6570\u548c\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u53cd\u9988\u89e3\u51b3\u5c5e\u6027\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eC\u00b3TG\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c5e\u6027\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6bd2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "C\u00b3TG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7ef4\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6539\u3002"}}

While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAN\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u53ef\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56e0\u679c\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u548c\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b(GLP)\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePAN\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "PAN\u5411\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8fc8\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u62df\u3002"}}

The method integrates a cultural object detection backbone with a structured program generation layer, yielding a pipeline in which answer prediction and explanation are tightly coupled.

The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions.

Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively.

However, under domain shift, they suffer from feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and severe miscalibration. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often require backpropagation through large backbones, covariance estimation, or heavy memory/state, which is problematic for streaming and edge scenarios. We propose Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation (UL-TTA), a fully training-free and backprop-free framework that freezes the backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters: class prototypes, class priors, and temperature. UL-TTA performs an online EM-style procedure with (i) selective sample filtering to use only confident predictions, (ii) closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes and priors anchored by text and Dirichlet priors, (iii) decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and (iv) lightweight guards (norm clipping, prior KL constraints, smoothed temperature) to prevent drift in long streams. Across large-scale cross-domain and OOD benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet, Terra Incognita, ImageNet-R/A/V2/Sketch; ~726K test samples) and strong TTA baselines including Tent, T3A, CoTTA, SAR, Tip-Adapter, and FreeTTA, UL-TTA consistently improves top-1 accuracy (e.g., +4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP on average) while reducing ECE by 20-30%, with less than 8% latency overhead. Long-stream experiments up to 200K samples show no collapse.

With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization.

To address these challenges, we propose PIFF, a physics-informed, flow-based generative neural network for near real-time flood depth estimation. Built on an image-to-image generative framework, it efficiently maps Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to flood depth predictions. The model is conditioned on a simplified inundation model (SPM) that embeds hydrodynamic priors into the training process. Additionally, a transformer-based rainfall encoder captures temporal dependencies in precipitation. Integrating physics-informed constraints with data-driven learning, PIFF captures the causal relationships between rainfall, topography, SPM, and flooding, replacing costly simulations with accurate, real-time flood maps.

Albeit substantial efforts, most of them remain closed-ended and are prone to overfitting due to the potential data contamination in the ever-growing training corpus of large models, thereby undermining the credibility of the evaluation. Moreover, the increasing scale and scope of current benchmarks with transient metrics, as well as the heavily human-dependent curation procedure, pose significant challenges for timely maintenance and adaptation to gauge the advancing capabilities of large models. In this paper, we introduce MACEval, a \\Multi-Agent Continual Evaluation network for dynamic evaluation of large models, and define a new set of metrics to quantify performance longitudinally and sustainably. MACEval adopts an interactive and autonomous evaluation mode that employs role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing through a cascaded agent network. Extensive experiments on 9 open-ended tasks with 23 participating large models demonstrate that MACEval is (1) human-free and automatic, mitigating laborious result processing with inter-agent judgment guided; (2) efficient and economical, reducing a considerable amount of data and overhead to obtain similar results compared to related benchmarks; and (3) flexible and scalable, migrating or integrating existing benchmarks via customized evaluation topologies.

Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \\textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \\textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones.

Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque.

Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations.

However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DermBench\u548cDermEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u542b4000\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaDermBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b4000\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u53d9\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3DermEval\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u8003\u5373\u53ef\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u751f\u6210\u53d9\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6279\u5224\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u57284500\u4e2a\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDermBench\u548cDermEval\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.251\u548c0.117\uff08\u6ee1\u52065\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e3a\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM).

Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \\texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "TACO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8fd9\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "TACO\u5c06\u56de\u7b54\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u5199\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u63aa\u8f9e\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u9ed1\u76d2\uff09\u6216\u81ea\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u7070\u76d2\uff09\u805a\u5408\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u70bc\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08POPE\u3001MME\u3001HallusionBench\u3001AMBER\u548cMM-Hal Bench\uff09\u548c\u4e24\u4e2aMLLM\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTACO\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "TACO\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u51cf\u8f7b\u5e7b\u89c9\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose a novel understanding framework for gradient-based attribution from an information-theoretic perspective. We prove that, under mild conditions, the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics of input features with respect to class labels. Motivated by this finding, we propose an encoding-decoding perspective : forward propagation encodes inputs into class space, while VJP in backpropagation decodes this encoding back to feature space. Therefore, we propose Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle information flow. By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, alongside consistent classification accuracy gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eVJP\u5f62\u6210\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888(S-IB)\u6765\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u8026\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u5e38\u5b66\u4e60\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u5224\u522b\u6027\u524d\u666f\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u865a\u5047\u80cc\u666f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6df7\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7f16\u7801-\u89e3\u7801\u89c6\u89d2\uff1a\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u7c7b\u522b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u800c\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u7684VJP\u5c06\u6b64\u7f16\u7801\u89e3\u7801\u56de\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888(S-IB)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u524d\u666fVJP\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u7f51\u7edc\u4ec5\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\u7f16\u7801\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u516d\u79cd\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u83b7\u5f97\u666e\u904d\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u524d\u666f\u96c6\u4e2d\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u65b9\u6cd5\u7279\u5b9a\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4VJP\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u89e3\u91ca\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, the correlations between those two aspects and commonly available readability measures (such as readability formulas or linguistic features) have not been the focus of as much attention. In this work, we investigate the place of readability measures in ATS by complementing the existing studies on evaluation metrics and human judgment, on English. We first discuss the relationship between ATS and research in readability, then we report a study on correlations between readability measures and human judgment, and between readability measures and ATS evaluation metrics. We identify that in general, readability measures do not correlate well with automatic metrics and human judgment.

However, deploying its intricate decoder on resource and power-constrained edge devices presents challenges due to numerous parameters, the inflexibility to adapt to dynamically evolving algorithms, and the high power consumption induced by extensive computations and data transmission. This paper for the first time proposes a novel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)-oriented AGC deployment scheme for edge-computing video services. Initially, we analyze the AGC algorithm and employ network compression methods including post-training static quantization and layer fusion techniques. Subsequently, we design an overlapped accelerator utilizing the co-processor paradigm to perform computations through software-hardware co-design.

The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors.

Although this ownership structure grants decision-making autonomy, it places a burden of responsibility on cooperative's board members. Most board members lack the resources or expertise to manage properties and their energy consumption. This ignorance presents a unique challenge, especially given the EU directives that prohibit buildings rated as energy classes F and G by 2033. Conversational agents (CAs) enable human-like interactions with computer systems, facilitating human-computer interaction across various domains. In our case, CAs can be implemented to support cooperative members in making informed energy retrofitting and usage decisions. This paper introduces a Conversational agent system, called SPARA, designed to advise cooperatives on energy efficiency. SPARA functions as an energy efficiency advisor by leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with a Language Model(LM). The LM generates targeted recommendations based on a knowledge base composed of email communications between professional energy advisors and cooperatives' representatives in Stockholm. The preliminary results indicate that SPARA can provide energy efficiency advice with precision 80\\%, comparable to that of municipal energy efficiency (EE) experts.

However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality.

However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task.

When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5728\u5e08\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5bf9\u6297\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u751f\u53cd\u9988\u6559\u5e08\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8ba9\u6559\u5e08\u80fd\u591f\u76f8\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6559\u5e08\u76d1\u7763\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u6b67\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u4e00\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u5e08\u751f\u8303\u5f0f\u9762\u4e34\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u9519\u8bef\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4e14\u5b66\u751f\u4f1a\u53cd\u590d\u786e\u8ba4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u5bfc\u81f4\u81ea\u6211\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5728\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u6b63\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5e08\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53cd\u9988\u5f52\u56e0\u5668\uff08\u8bc6\u522b\u89e6\u53d1\u5b66\u751f\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u63a5\u6536\u5668\uff08\u786e\u5b9a\u53cd\u9988\u5e94\u7528\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6559\u5e08\u76d1\u7763\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e00\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5e08\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u6297\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "comment": "7 pages, 2 figures, v1 init", "summary": "In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy.

For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set. An optional calibration-only distillation aligns the quantized model with the posterior predictive teacher.

Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edcTDCNet\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u5377\u79ef\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408TDC\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f81\u5f31\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f46\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c3D\u5377\u79ef\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u5377\u79ef\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e76\u884cTDC\u5757\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u548c3D\u5377\u79ef\u5f62\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5377\u79ef\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u5f15\u5165TDC\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728TDC\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u5e76\u884c3D\u4e3b\u5e72\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5efa\u6a21\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728IRSTD-UAV\u548c\u516c\u5171\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTDCNet\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TDCNet\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6279\u5224\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u7269\u58f0\u5b66AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ffd\u89c6AI\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u7269\u79cd\u9012\u5f52\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u76f8\u9047\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6c\u5411\u4e0d\u540c\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5916\u4ea4\u5f0f\u76f8\u9047\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u7269\u58f0\u5b66AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u6027\u80fd\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e3b\u4f53\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u7269\u79cd\u9012\u5f52\u901a\u4fe1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76f8\u9047\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u626d\u66f2\u548c\u906e\u853d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u54f2\u5b66\u5bb6Yuk Hui\u5173\u4e8e\u9012\u5f52\u6027\u548c\u5076\u7136\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e3b\u4f53\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u5904\u7406\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u6765\u5904\u7406\u5176\u4ed6\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u53cc\u91cd\u5076\u7136\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u7269\u79cd\u901a\u4fe1\u4ea7\u751f\u4e8e\u5076\u7136\u7684\u751f\u6001\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u800cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u5076\u7136\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u626d\u66f2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u751f\u7269\u58f0\u5b66AI\uff0c\u4ece\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6c\u5411\u4e0d\u540c\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5916\u4ea4\u5f0f\u76f8\u9047\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Preprint, under review for Eurographics 2026", "summary": "Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity.

Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc72D-3D\u914d\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0e\u672f\u524dCT\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u672f\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u547c\u5438\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u53d8\u5f02\u548cCT\u4e0e\u4f53\u5185\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u548c\u8de8\u60a3\u8005\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u76f4\u63a5\u8ba1\u7b97\u771f\u5b9e\u5185\u7aa5\u955cRGB\u5e27\u4e0eCT\u6e32\u67d3\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee2.65\u6beb\u7c73\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee0.19\u5f27\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8fdb\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7.

Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches.

The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAKER\u7cfb\u7edf\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u6b65LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u96f6\u9519\u8bef\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u7aef\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5fae\u4ee3\u7406\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u6d1e\u5bdf\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6267\u884c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6d41\u7a0b\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5173\u6ce8\u77ed\u903b\u8f91\u94fe\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6781\u7aef\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u53ef\u7531\u4e13\u6ce8\u5fae\u4ee3\u7406\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u8fdb\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u6b65LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e14\u96f6\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u89e3\u4ee3\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MDAPs\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u793e\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6784ViT\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u540c\u6784CNN\u6559\u5e08\u534f\u540c\u6307\u5bfc\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5e08\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "Vision Transformers\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u79c0\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cfCNNs\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u540c\u6784CNN\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5e08\u52a0\u6743 - \u57fa\u4e8e\u6559\u5e08\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u9884\u6d4b\u5dee\u5f02\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408ViT\u548cCNN\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2) \u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f - \u5b66\u751f\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u652f\u5b66\u4e60ViT\u548cCNN\u6559\u5e08\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728HMDB51\u3001EPIC-KITCHENS-100\u548cKinetics-400\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728HMDB51\u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u83b7\u5f975.95%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u540c\u6784\u6559\u5e08\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u4e0eViT\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation.

To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamPose3D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u76843D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u60f3\u8c61\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5173\u8282\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u5e76\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u5e27\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u7cca\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5c42\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\u63d0\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5173\u8282\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528\u5e7b\u89c9\u59ff\u6001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D\u59ff\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728Human3.6M\u548cMPI-3DHP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5e7f\u64ad\u68d2\u7403\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5373\u4f7f\u9762\u5bf9\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u76842D\u8f93\u5165\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5065\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DreamPose3D\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u60f3\u8c61\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details.

However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability.

Rather than simply fine-tuning a heavy-weight vision-language model (VLM) for new domains, we introduce RF-DETR, a light-weight specialist detection transformer that discovers accuracy-latency Pareto curves for any target dataset with weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS). Our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained base network on a target dataset and evaluates thousands of network configurations with different accuracy-latency tradeoffs without re-training. Further, we revisit the \"tunable knobs\" for NAS to improve the transferability of DETRs to diverse target domains. Notably, RF-DETR significantly improves on prior state-of-the-art real-time methods on COCO and Roboflow100-VL. RF-DETR (nano) achieves 48.0 AP on COCO, beating D-FINE (nano) by 5.3 AP at similar latency, and RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms GroundingDINO (tiny) by 1.2 AP on Roboflow100-VL while running 20x as fast.

However, many existing methods, including large audio language models, struggle with processing long audio. Follow the success of retrieval augmented generation, a speech-related retriever shows promising in help preprocessing long-form speech.

To address this challenge, we propose CLSR, an end-to-end contrastive language-speech retriever that efficiently extracts question-relevant segments from long audio recordings for downstream SQA task. Unlike conventional speech-text contrastive models, CLSR incorporates an intermediate step that converts acoustic features into text-like representations prior to alignment, thereby more effectively bridging the gap between modalities.

Yet, its performance is limited when only a small amount of labeled data is available, while there is abundant valuable yet often overlooked hierarchical information in medical data. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from self-supervised learning and propose SAMora, an innovative framework that captures hierarchical medical knowledge by applying complementary self-supervised learning objectives at the image, patch, and pixel levels. To fully exploit the complementarity of hierarchical knowledge within LoRAs, we introduce HL-Attn, a hierarchical fusion module that integrates multi-scale features while maintaining their distinct characteristics. SAMora is compatible with various SAM variants, including SAM2, SAMed, and H-SAM.

Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

Using 10-fold cross-validation, our model achieved an average accuracy of 97.43 percent and sensitivity of 99.09 percent for binary classification. For three-class classification, it achieved an average accuracy of 95.47 percent and sensitivity of 94.98 percent. Unlike many deep learning models, our approach does not require data augmentation or extensive preprocessing, making it particularly suitable for smaller datasets. Topological features differ significantly from those commonly extracted using convolutional filters and other deep learning machinery. Because it provides an entirely different type of information from machine learning models, it has the potential to combine topological features with other models later on.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u8111\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784MRI\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Betti\u51fd\u6570\u5c06\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408XGBoost\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u6cbb\u7597\u836f\u7269\u83b7\u6279\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u3001\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u5206\u6790\u8111\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784MRI\uff0c\u5c06\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u8fc7Betti\u51fd\u6570\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4e0eXGBoost\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728ADNI 3D MRI\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u738797.43%\u3001\u7075\u654f\u5ea699.09%\uff1b\u4e09\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u738795.47%\u3001\u7075\u654f\u5ea694.98%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6216\u590d\u6742\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing compression methods primarily apply masks to suppress background information before quantization. This explicit bit allocation strategy, which uses hard gating, significantly impacts the statistical distribution of the entropy model, thereby limiting the coding performance of the compression model. In response, this work proposes an efficient ROI-based deep image compression model with implicit bit allocation. To better utilize ROI masks for implicit bit allocation, this paper proposes a novel Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement (MGFE) module, comprising a Region-Adaptive Attention (RAA) block and a Frequency-Spatial Collaborative Attention (FSCA) block. This module allows for flexible bit allocation across different regions while enhancing global and local features through frequencyspatial domain collaboration. Additionally, we use dual decoders to separately reconstruct foreground and background images, enabling the coding network to optimally balance foreground enhancement and background quality preservation in a datadriven manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize implicit bit allocation for high-quality regionadaptive coding. Experiments on the COCO2017 dataset show that our implicit-based image compression method significantly outperforms explicit bit allocation approaches in rate-distortion performance, achieving optimal results while maintaining satisfactory visual quality in the reconstructed background regions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548ROI\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Mask-Guided\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53cc\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u533a\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u80cc\u666f\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7387\u5931\u771f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ROI\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\uff08\u786c\u95e8\u63a7\u63a9\u7801\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u71b5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9650\u5236\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMask-Guided\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5305\u542b\u533a\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5757\u548c\u9891\u7387-\u7a7a\u95f4\u534f\u4f5c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5757\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5206\u522b\u91cd\u5efa\u524d\u666f\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u5f0f\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728COCO2017\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7387\u5931\u771f\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u80cc\u666f\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u6301\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u9690\u5f0f\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u533a\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728ROI\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing zero-shot studies have shown that incorporating memory mechanisms to support goal-directed behavior can improve long-horizon planning performance. However, they overlook visual frontier boundaries, which fundamentally dictate future trajectories and observations, and fall short of inferring the relationship between partial visual observations and navigation goals. In this paper, we propose Semantic Cognition Over Potential-based Exploration (SCOPE), a zero-shot framework that explicitly leverages frontier information to drive potential-based exploration, enabling more informed and goal-relevant decisions. SCOPE estimates exploration potential with a Vision-Language Model and organizes it into a spatio-temporal potential graph, capturing boundary dynamics to support long-horizon planning. In addition, SCOPE incorporates a self-reconsideration mechanism that revisits and refines prior decisions, enhancing reliability and reducing overconfident errors. Experimental results on two diverse embodied navigation tasks show that SCOPE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 4.6\\% in accuracy. Further analysis demonstrates that its core components lead to improved calibration, stronger generalization, and higher decision quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCOPE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u6f5c\u529b\u56fe\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u660e\u667a\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u76f8\u5173\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8fb9\u754c\u8fd9\u4e00\u51b3\u5b9a\u672a\u6765\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u63a8\u65ad\u90e8\u5206\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0e\u5bfc\u822a\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCOPE\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a2\u7d22\u6f5c\u529b\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u7a7a\u6f5c\u529b\u56fe\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u6211\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u673a\u5236\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5148\u524d\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b3\uff09\u663e\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cSCOPE\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad8\u51fa4.6%\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "SCOPE\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8fb9\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Although recent studies on deep learning (DL) offer a promising alternative to traditional solvers, the field lacks standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are flawed due to a lack of comparing specialized MicroEvo DL models with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal architectures, an overemphasis on numerical accuracy over physical fidelity, and a failure to analyze error propagation over time. To address these gaps, we introduce MicroEvoEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for image-based microstructure evolution prediction. We evaluate 14 models, encompassing both domain-specific and general-purpose architectures, across four representative MicroEvo tasks with datasets specifically structured for both short- and long-term assessment. Our multi-faceted evaluation framework goes beyond numerical accuracy and computational cost, incorporating a curated set of structure-preserving metrics to assess physical fidelity. Our extensive evaluations yield several key insights. Notably, we find that modern architectures (e.g., VMamba), not only achieve superior long-term stability and physical fidelity but also operate with an order-of-magnitude greater computational efficiency.

This challenge arises from a combination of underspecified language, imperfect visual data, and deictic gestures, which frequently leads to task failure. Existing monolithic Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to resolve these multimodal ambiguous inputs, often failing silently or hallucinating responses. To address these ambiguities, we introduce the Plug-and-Play Clarifier, a zero-shot and modular framework that decomposes the problem into discrete, solvable sub-tasks. Specifically, our framework consists of three synergistic modules: (1) a text clarifier that uses dialogue-driven reasoning to interactively disambiguate linguistic intent, (2) a vision clarifier that delivers real-time guidance feedback, instructing users to adjust their positioning for improved capture quality, and (3) a cross-modal clarifier with grounding mechanism that robustly interprets 3D pointing gestures and identifies the specific objects users are pointing to. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework improves the intent clarification performance of small language models (4--8B) by approximately 30%, making them competitive with significantly larger counterparts.

A core technology for analyzing such images, associated with spatiotemporal information, is Traffic Scene Understanding (TSU), which aims to provide a comprehensive description of the traffic scene. Unlike traditional spatio-temporal data analysis tasks, the dependence on both spatio-temporal and visual-textual data introduces distinct challenges to TSU task. However, recent research often treats TSU as a common image understanding task, ignoring the spatio-temporal information and overlooking the interrelations between different aspects of the traffic scene. To address these issues, we propose a novel SpatioTemporal Enhanced Model based on CILP (ST-CLIP) for TSU. Our model uses the classic vision-language model, CLIP, as the backbone, and designs a Spatio-temporal Context Aware Multiaspect Prompt (SCAMP) learning method to incorporate spatiotemporal information into TSU. The prompt learning method consists of two components: A dynamic spatio-temporal context representation module that extracts representation vectors of spatio-temporal data for each traffic scene image, and a bi-level ST-aware multi-aspect prompt learning module that integrates the ST-context representation vectors into word embeddings of prompts for the CLIP model. The second module also extracts low-level visual features and image-wise high-level semantic features to exploit interactive relations among different aspects of traffic scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate spatio-temporal information into visionlanguage models to facilitate TSU task.

Existing approaches enforce curvature priors using full Hessian information obtained via second-order automatic differentiation, which is accurate but computationally expensive.

In contrast, our method replaces these operations with lightweight finite-difference stencils that approximate second derivatives using the well known Taylor expansion with a truncation error of O(h^2), and can serve as drop-in replacements for Gaussian curvature and rank-deficiency losses. Experiments demonstrate that our finite-difference variants achieve reconstruction fidelity comparable to their automatic-differentiation counterparts, while reducing GPU memory usage and training time by up to a factor of two.

While recent multi-agent approaches introduce cooperation, they often focus merely on perception-level tasks, overlooking the alignment with downstream planning and control, or fall short in leveraging the full capacity of the recent emerging end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present UniMM-V2X, a novel end-to-end multi-agent framework that enables hierarchical cooperation across perception, prediction, and planning. At the core of our framework is a multi-level fusion strategy that unifies perception and prediction cooperation, allowing agents to share queries and reason cooperatively for consistent and safe decision-making.

Existing software is developed based on models or motion-captured data, resulting in limited flexibility. To address this issue, a simulator that directly generates Doppler spectra from recorded video footage (RadHARSimulator V2) is presented in this paper. Both computer vision and radar modules are included in the simulator. In computer vision module, the real-time model for object detection with global nearest neighbor is first used to detect and track human targets in the video. Then, the high-resolution network is used to estimate two-dimensional poses of the detected human targets. Next, the three-dimensional poses of the detected human targets are obtained by nearest matching method. Finally, smooth temporal three-dimensional pose estimation is achieved through Kalman filtering. In radar module, pose interpolation and smoothing are first achieved through the Savitzky-Golay method. Second, the delay model and the mirror method are used to simulate echoes in both free-space and through-the-wall scenarios. Then, range-time map is generated using pulse compression, moving target indication, and DnCNN. Next, Doppler-time map (DTM) is generated using short-time Fourier transform and DnCNN again. Finally, the ridge features on the DTM are extracted using the maximum local energy method. In addition, a hybrid parallel-serial neural network architecture is proposed for radar-based HAR. Numerical experiments are conducted and analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed simulator and the proposed network model.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sparse Motion Field Visual Odometry (SMF-VO), a lightweight, 'motion-centric' framework.

FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory.

In contrast, abundant human motion data is readily available from motion capture, videos, and virtual reality, which could help address the data scarcity problem. However, due to the embodiment gap and missing dynamic information like force and torque, these demonstrations cannot be directly executed on robots. To bridge this gap, we propose Scalable Physics-Informed DExterous Retargeting (SPIDER), a physics-based retargeting framework to transform and augment kinematic-only human demonstrations to dynamically feasible robot trajectories at scale. Our key insight is that human demonstrations should provide global task structure and objective, while large-scale physics-based sampling with curriculum-style virtual contact guidance should refine trajectories to ensure dynamical feasibility and correct contact sequences. SPIDER scales across diverse 9 humanoid/dexterous hand embodiments and 6 datasets, improving success rates by 18% compared to standard sampling, while being 10X faster than reinforcement learning (RL) baselines, and enabling the generation of a 2.4M frames dynamic-feasible robot dataset for policy learning.

However, these models struggle with long-horizon tasks due to their lack of memory and reliance solely on immediate sensory inputs. To address this limitation, we propose Memory-Augmented Prompting for Vision-Language-Action model (MAP-VLA), a novel framework that empowers pre-trained VLA models with demonstration-derived memory prompts to augment action generation for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. To achieve this, MAP-VLA first constructs a memory library from historical demonstrations, where each memory unit captures information about a specific stage of a task. These memory units are implemented as learnable soft prompts optimized through prompt tuning. Then, during real-time task execution, MAP-VLA retrieves relevant memory through trajectory similarity matching and dynamically integrates it into the VLA model for augmented action generation. Importantly, this prompt tuning and retrieval augmentation approach operates as a plug-and-play module for a frozen VLA model, offering a lightweight and flexible solution to improve task performance. Experimental results show that MAP-VLA delivers up to 7.0% absolute performance gains in the simulation benchmark and 25.0% on real robot evaluations for long-horizon tasks, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAP-VLA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6f14\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b07.0%\u548c25.0%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u4e14\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5373\u65f6\u611f\u5b98\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\uff0c\u5c06\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5355\u5143\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u5230VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b07.0%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b025.0%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MAP-VLA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4e3a\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Point-based methods suffer from sparse sampling, leading to the loss of fine-grained semantics. Image-based methods typically feed RGB and depth into 2D backbones pre-trained on 3D auxiliary tasks, but their entangled semantics and geometry are sensitive to inherent depth noise in real-world that disrupts semantic understanding. Moreover, these methods focus on high-level geometry while overlooking low-level spatial cues essential for precise interaction. We propose SpatialActor, a disentangled framework for robust robotic manipulation that explicitly decouples semantics and geometry. The Semantic-guided Geometric Module adaptively fuses two complementary geometry from noisy depth and semantic-guided expert priors. Also, a Spatial Transformer leverages low-level spatial cues for accurate 2D-3D mapping and enables interaction among spatial features. We evaluate SpatialActor on multiple simulation and real-world scenarios across 50+ tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with 87.4% on RLBench and improves by 13.9% to 19.4% under varying noisy conditions, showing strong robustness. Moreover, it significantly enhances few-shot generalization to new tasks and maintains robustness under various spatial perturbations.

However, while these models can direct a robot toward the general region of an object, they lack the geometric understanding required to precisely control dexterous robotic hands for 3D grasping. To overcome this, our key insight is to leverage simulation with a force-closure grasping generation pipeline that understands local geometries of the hand and object in the scene. Because this pipeline is slow and requires ground-truth observations, the resulting data is distilled into a diffusion model that operates in real-time on camera point clouds. By combining the global semantic understanding of internet-scale models with the geometric precision of a simulation-based locally-aware force-closure, \\our achieves high-performance semantic grasping without any manually collected training data.
