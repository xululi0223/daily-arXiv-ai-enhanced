However, the prior arts overlook\nthe influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation\nAttack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction\nto guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.\nSpecifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input\ngradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which\nencompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying\non the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation\ndirection, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient\nand the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation\ndirection. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of\nResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the\ntransferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current\ninput transformation methods.

However, existing methods for detecting LLM plagiarism\nfall short in key areas. They fail to accurately reconstruct weight\ncorrespondences, lack the ability to compute statistical significance measures\nsuch as $p$-values, and may mistakenly flag models trained on similar data as\nbeing related. To address these limitations, we propose Matrix-Driven Instant\nReview (MDIR), a novel method that leverages matrix analysis and Large\nDeviation Theory.

While several existing methods optimize attention\ncomputation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer,\nlimiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative\nframework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical\nprompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information\ndiffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through\nlayers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion\nprocess suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive\ntokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states.\nMotivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning\nmechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at\nintermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous\nKV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex\npredictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments\nshow that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\\mathbf{2.53\\times}$ time-to-first-token\n(TTFT) speedup and $\\mathbf{1.88\\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for\nLLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on\nLongBench.

These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory\nattributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these\ntwo tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.\nHowever, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to\nlearning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both\nsalient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint\nlearning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,\nassuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution\ncharacteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and\nvariances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal\namount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network\nstructure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at\na minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy\n(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set\nsizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and\nshortens the training time.

This model constructs a densely nested\nskip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature\nDisentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the\nfunctions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity\nand enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a\nBranch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically\nwith the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and\nfrequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness.\nFurthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical\nadaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation\non 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet\nachieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results\noutperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and\nSwin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant\noptimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images."}

This energy is the sum of image\ndata terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries.\nGoldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \\cite{gold:bre} so\nthat their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman\nmethod to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation. We provide a detailed\nimplementation of this method \\cite{gold:bre}, and document its performance\nwith several images over a range of algorithm parameters."}

KnapFormer builds on the insight that strong\nsynergy exists between sequence parallelism and the need to address the\nsignificant token imbalance across ranks. This imbalance arises from\nvariable-length text inputs and varying visual token counts in mixed-resolution\nand image-video joint training. KnapFormer redistributes tokens by first\ngathering sequence length metadata across all ranks in a balancing group and\nsolving a global knapsack problem. The solver aims to minimize the variances of\ntotal workload per-GPU, while accounting for the effect of sequence\nparallelism. By integrating DeepSpeed-Ulysees-based sequence parallelism in the\nload-balancing decision process and utilizing a simple semi-empirical workload\nmodel, KnapFormers achieves minimal communication overhead and less than 1%\nworkload discrepancy in real-world training workloads with sequence length\nvarying from a few hundred to tens of thousands.

In the latter,\ncurrent assessment methods heavily depend on operator expertise, and the high\nheterogeneity of lesions complicates diagnosis, with biopsy persisting as the\ngold standard despite its substantial costs and risks. A critical bottleneck\nfor specialized endoscopic CADx/e systems is the lack of well-annotated\ndatasets with sufficient variability for real-world generalization. This study\nintroduces a novel approach that exploits a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM)\ncoupled with a ControlNet adapter to generate laryngeal endoscopic\nimage-annotation pairs, guided by clinical observations. The method addresses\ndata scarcity by conditioning the diffusion process to produce realistic,\nhigh-quality, and clinically relevant image features that capture diverse\nanatomical conditions. The proposed approach can be leveraged to expand\ntraining datasets for CADx/e models, empowering the assessment process in\nlaryngology. Indeed, during a downstream task of detection, the addition of\nonly 10% synthetic data improved the detection rate of laryngeal lesions by 9%\nwhen the model was internally tested and 22.1% on out-of-domain external data.\nAdditionally, the realism of the generated images was evaluated by asking 5\nexpert otorhinolaryngologists with varying expertise to rate their confidence\nin distinguishing synthetic from real images.
