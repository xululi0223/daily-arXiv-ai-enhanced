TL;DR: Gemini 2.X模型家族包括Gemini 2.5 Pro、Gemini 2.5 Flash以及早期的Gemini 2.0 Flash和Flash-Lite，覆盖了模型性能与成本的全范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提供一系列模型以满足不同计算和延迟需求，同时推动复杂代理工作流的发展。

Method: 开发Gemini 2.5 Pro（支持多模态理解和长上下文处理）和Gemini 2.5 Flash（低计算需求），以及优化Gemini 2.0 Flash和Flash-Lite。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在多模态理解和推理任务上达到SoTA性能，Gemini 2.5 Flash在低计算需求下表现优异。

Conclusion: Gemini 2.X模型家族为用户提供了全面的性能与成本选择，推动了代理工作流的创新。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce the Gemini 2.X model family: Gemini 2.5 Pro and
Gemini 2.5 Flash, as well as our earlier Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite
models. Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA
performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its
incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that
excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours
of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and
reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini
2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute
and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high
performance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model
generation spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing
users to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic
problem solving.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLM）在多语言环境中存在过度自信问题，导致用户过度依赖其回答，且不同语言间的依赖行为存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在多语言环境中的安全性，特别是其校准不确定性和局限性的能力，以避免用户过度依赖。

Method: 分析五种语言中LLM生成的认识标记分布，并测量用户在不同语言中对LLM回答的依赖率。

Result: LLM在所有语言中均表现出过度自信，但不同语言间的标记分布和用户依赖行为存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 多语言校准面临挑战，需结合文化和语言背景进行模型安全性评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that
their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey
uncertainty and limitations. Previous work has shown that LLMs are
linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident
generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,
'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we
study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,
and overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a
global context.
  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first
analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that
while LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to
documented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers
of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and
Mandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that
while users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,
reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely
significantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.
Taken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident
model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of
multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and
linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.

TL;DR: ETT方法通过高效微调短上下文Transformer模型的参数，以线性计算开销和恒定内存需求扩展上下文长度，提升模型在长序列任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在长序列处理中因二次计算和内存开销面临挑战，需要一种高效扩展上下文长度的方法。

Method: ETT通过将输入上下文分块为重叠子序列并微调模型参数，实现上下文长度的扩展。

Result: 在LongBench上，ETT将GPT-Large和Phi-2的上下文长度从1k扩展到32k，准确率提升30%。

Conclusion: ETT证明了通过微调特定模块（如FFN的第二层）可高效扩展上下文长度，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based Language Models' computation and memory overhead increase
quadratically as a function of sequence length. The quadratic cost poses
challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we
introduce \ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the
context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory
requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the
context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on
the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT
on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32
times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent
improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in
LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study,
we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at
test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs
is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in
the models' accuracy.

Result: 模型在交互对话环境中表现良好，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: “词作为分类器”模型是统一语义理论的有潜力的路径。

Abstract: Formal, Distributional, and Grounded theories of computational semantics each
have their uses and their drawbacks. There has been a shift to ground models of
language by adding visual knowledge, and there has been a call to enrich models
of language with symbolic methods to gain the benefits from formal,
distributional, and grounded theories. In this paper, we attempt to make the
case that one potential path forward in unifying all three semantic fields is
paved with the words-as-classifier model, a model of word-level grounded
semantics that has been incorporated into formalisms and distributional
language models in the literature, and it has been well-tested within
interactive dialogue settings. We review that literature, motivate the
words-as-classifiers model with an appeal to recent work in cognitive science,
and describe a small experiment. Finally, we sketch a model of semantics
unified through words-as-classifiers.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何评估分词器质量，扩展了MorphScore以支持更多语言，并发现形态学对齐对模型性能影响有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分词是语言建模的关键步骤，但如何有效评估分词器质量尚不明确，尤其是分词器是否能保留语言学的有意义子词。

Method: 扩展MorphScore至70种语言，改进其灵活性，并通过与下游任务性能的相关性分析形态学对齐的作用。

Result: 形态学对齐对模型性能的方差解释有限，表明其单独不足以衡量分词器质量对模型性能的影响。

Conclusion: 形态学对齐并非衡量分词器质量的关键维度，需探索其他评估方法。

Abstract: While tokenization is a key step in language modeling, with effects on model
training and performance, it remains unclear how to effectively evaluate
tokenizer quality. One proposed dimension of tokenizer quality is the extent to
which tokenizers preserve linguistically meaningful subwords, aligning token
boundaries with morphological boundaries within a word. We expand MorphScore
(Arnett & Bergen, 2025), which previously covered 22 languages, to support a
total of 70 languages. The updated MorphScore offers more flexibility in
evaluation and addresses some of the limitations of the original version. We
then correlate our alignment scores with downstream task performance for five
pre-trained languages models on seven tasks, with at least one task in each of
the languages in our sample. We find that morphological alignment does not
explain very much variance in model performance, suggesting that morphological
alignment alone does not measure dimensions of tokenization quality relevant to
model performance.

Motivation: 研究旨在将句法结构与数学结构（如岩浆和操作ad）联系起来，以更形式化地描述句法生成和移动规则。

Method: 使用头部函数扩展岩浆结构为超岩浆，并通过彩色操作ad描述句法生成系统，包括合并和移动规则。

Conclusion: 通过数学结构（如超岩浆和彩色操作ad）可以统一描述句法生成和移动规则，为句法理论提供了新的形式化工具。

Abstract: We show that head functions on syntactic objects extend the magma structure
to a hypermagma, with the c-command relation compatible with the magma
operation and the m-command relation with the hypermagma. We then show that the
structure of head and complement and specifier, additional modifier positions,
and the structure of phases in the Extended Projection can be formulated as a
bud generating system of a colored operad, in a form similar to the structure
of theta roles. We also show that, due to the special form of the colored
operad generators, the filtering of freely generated syntactic objects by these
coloring rules can be equivalently formulated as a filtering in the course of
structure formation via a colored Merge, which can in turn be related to the
hypermagma structure. The rules on movement by Internal Merge with respect to
phases, the Extended Projection Principle, Empty Category Principle, and Phase
Impenetrability Condition are all subsumed into the form of the colored operad
generators. Movement compatibilities between the phase structure and the theta
roles assignments can then be formulated in terms of the respective colored
operads and a transduction of colored operads.

TL;DR: PERK提出了一种参数高效的方法，通过梯度更新轻量级适配器在测试时编码长上下文，显著提升了长上下文推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文推理需要从大量噪声输入中准确识别相关信息，而现有的元学习方法因内存消耗过大难以应用于长上下文场景。

Method: PERK采用双层优化循环：内循环将上下文快速编码到低秩适配器（LoRA）中，外循环学习如何利用更新后的适配器准确回忆和推理相关信息。

Result: PERK在多个长上下文推理任务中表现优异，性能提升显著（GPT-2提升90%，Qwen-2.5-0.5B提升27%），且对推理复杂性、长度外推和信息位置更鲁棒。

Conclusion: PERK在训练时内存消耗较大，但在推理时比基于提示的方法更高效，是一种可扩展的长上下文推理解决方案。

Abstract: Long-context reasoning requires accurately identifying relevant information
in extensive, noisy input contexts. Previous research shows that using
test-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can
effectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning
methods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive,
preventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose
PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for
learning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight
model adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization
loops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a
low-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for
the base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter
to accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long
context. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK
significantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,
achieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models
(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In
general, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and
the locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while
PERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at
inference time than prompt-based long-context inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类偏好的复杂性和数据集覆盖有限，奖励模型在分布偏移或对抗扰动下容易失效。现有方法依赖先验知识，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出了一种不依赖偏好分布的先验知识的方法，通过奖励引导的解码发现失败模式，并利用REFORM框架生成对抗样本以增强训练数据。

Result: 在Anthropic HH和PKU Beavertails数据集上，REFORM显著提升了鲁棒性，同时保持了奖励质量，并在下游策略训练中表现良好。

Conclusion: REFORM通过自我改进机制有效提升了奖励模型的鲁棒性和对齐质量，消除了虚假相关性。

Abstract: Reward modeling (RM), which captures human preferences to align large
language models (LLMs), is increasingly employed in tasks such as model
finetuning, response filtering, and ranking. However, due to the inherent
complexity of human preferences and the limited coverage of available datasets,
reward models often fail under distributional shifts or adversarial
perturbations. Existing approaches for identifying such failure modes typically
rely on prior knowledge about preference distributions or failure attributes,
limiting their practicality in real-world settings where such information is
unavailable. In this work, we propose a tractable, preference-distribution
agnostic method for discovering reward model failure modes via reward guided
controlled decoding. Building on this, we introduce REFORM, a self-improving
reward modeling framework that enhances robustness by using the reward model
itself to guide the generation of falsely scored responses. These adversarial
examples are then used to augment the training data and patch the reward
model's misaligned behavior. We evaluate REFORM on two widely used preference
datasets Anthropic Helpful Harmless (HH) and PKU Beavertails and demonstrate
that it significantly improves robustness without sacrificing reward quality.
Notably, REFORM preserves performance both in direct evaluation and in
downstream policy training, and further improves alignment quality by removing
spurious correlations.

Result: 显著提升下游任务（如数学推理和隐喻检测）性能，并发现模型内部误解。

Conclusion: 该方法增强LLM的可解释性和性能，为模型优化提供新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are traditionally viewed as black-box
algorithms, therefore reducing trustworthiness and obscuring potential
approaches to increasing performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we
apply an effective LLM decomposition method using a dictionary-learning
approach with sparse autoencoders. This helps extract monosemantic features
from polysemantic LLM neurons. Remarkably, our work identifies model-internal
misunderstanding, allowing the automatic reformulation of the prompts with
additional annotations to improve the interpretation by LLMs. Moreover, this
approach demonstrates a significant performance improvement in downstream
tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and metaphor detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解政策语言的演变对评估全球应对复杂挑战（如气候变化）至关重要，传统方法效率低且难以捕捉复杂性。

Method: 使用动态嵌入主题模型（DETM）分析1995至2023年UNFCCC政策决策的语料库，排除2020年数据。

Result: 模型揭示了政策重点从温室气体转向实施、技术合作、能力建设和全球协议。

Conclusion: DETM是分析全球政策语言演变的有效工具，未来可扩展至其他政策领域。

Abstract: Understanding how policy language evolves over time is critical for assessing
global responses to complex challenges such as climate change. Temporal
analysis helps stakeholders, including policymakers and researchers, to
evaluate past priorities, identify emerging themes, design governance
strategies, and develop mitigation measures. Traditional approaches, such as
manual thematic coding, are time-consuming and limited in capturing the
complex, interconnected nature of global policy discourse. With the increasing
relevance of unsupervised machine learning, these limitations can be addressed,
particularly under high-volume, complex, and high-dimensional data conditions.
In this work, we explore a novel approach that applies the dynamic embedded
topic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse.
A probabilistic model designed to capture the temporal dynamics of topics over
time. We collected a corpus of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) policy decisions from 1995 to 2023, excluding 2020 due to the
postponement of COP26 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model reveals
shifts from early emphases on greenhouse gases and international conventions to
recent focuses on implementation, technical collaboration, capacity building,
finance, and global agreements. Section 3 presents the modeling pipeline,
including preprocessing, model training, and visualization of temporal word
distributions. Our results show that DETM is a scalable and effective tool for
analyzing the evolution of global policy discourse. Section 4 discusses the
implications of these findings and we concluded with future directions and
refinements to extend this approach to other policy domains.

Motivation: 当前RLVR方法在纯文本领域表现优异，但在多模态推理任务中因视觉输入感知不足而性能下降。

Method: 提出PAPO方法，通过引入隐式感知损失（KL散度项）优化GRPO目标，无需额外数据或外部奖励模型。

Result: 在多模态基准测试中整体提升4.4%，视觉依赖任务中提升近8.0%，感知错误减少30.5%。

Conclusion: PAPO为RLVR学习目标引入了感知感知监督，为视觉基础推理的新RL框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be a
highly effective strategy for endowing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust
multi-step reasoning abilities. However, its design and optimizations remain
tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when
applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major
source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of
visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy
Optimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages
the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal
supervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation,
external reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the
Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO
objective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall
improvements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more
pronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also
observe a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating
improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis
of PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze
and mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a
deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning
objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages
visually grounded reasoning. Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/PAPO.

Result: 实验表明，小模型在增强数据上训练后性能优于大语言模型，实现了高效、准确且可解释的时间归一化。

Conclusion: 该方法为时间归一化提供了一种新的解决方案，兼具实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Time normalization is the task of converting natural language temporal
expressions into machine-readable representations. It underpins many downstream
applications in information retrieval, question answering, and clinical
decision-making. Traditional systems based on the ISO-TimeML schema limit
expressivity and struggle with complex constructs such as compositional,
event-relative, and multi-span time expressions. In this work, we introduce a
novel formulation of time normalization as a code generation task grounded in
the SCATE framework, which defines temporal semantics through symbolic and
compositional operators. We implement a fully executable SCATE Python library
and demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can generate executable SCATE
code. Leveraging this capability, we develop an automatic data augmentation
pipeline using LLMs to synthesize large-scale annotated data with code-level
validation. Our experiments show that small, locally deployable models trained
on this augmented data can achieve strong performance, outperforming even their
LLM parents and enabling practical, accurate, and interpretable time
normalization.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了线性注意力机制在长序列处理中的局限性，并通过系统评估多种线性注意力模型及其混合架构，提出了优化建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在处理长序列时面临二次复杂度和内存问题，线性注意力机制虽能缓解但召回性能有限，因此需要研究混合架构中线性注意力的选择。

Method: 系统评估了六种线性注意力变体及其五种混合比例，训练并开源了72个模型（340M和1.3B参数），在语言建模和召回任务上进行了基准测试。

Result: 研究发现，优秀的独立线性模型在混合架构中表现不一定好；召回性能随全注意力层增加显著提升，尤其在3:1比例以下。

Conclusion: 选择性门控、分层递归和可控遗忘对混合模型至关重要，推荐使用HGRN-2或GatedDeltaNet，线性与全注意力比例在3:1到6:1之间。

Abstract: Transformers face quadratic complexity and memory issues with long sequences,
prompting the adoption of linear attention mechanisms using fixed-size hidden
states. However, linear models often suffer from limited recall performance,
leading to hybrid architectures that combine linear and full attention layers.
Despite extensive hybrid architecture research, the choice of linear attention
component has not been deeply explored. We systematically evaluate various
linear attention models across generations - vector recurrences to advanced
gating mechanisms - both standalone and hybridized. To enable this
comprehensive analysis, we trained and open-sourced 72 models: 36 at 340M
parameters (20B tokens) and 36 at 1.3B parameters (100B tokens), covering six
linear attention variants across five hybridization ratios. Benchmarking on
standard language modeling and recall tasks reveals that superior standalone
linear models do not necessarily excel in hybrids. While language modeling
remains stable across linear-to-full attention ratios, recall significantly
improves with increased full attention layers, particularly below a 3:1 ratio.
Our study highlights selective gating, hierarchical recurrence, and controlled
forgetting as critical for effective hybrid models. We recommend architectures
such as HGRN-2 or GatedDeltaNet with a linear-to-full ratio between 3:1 and 6:1
to achieve Transformer-level recall efficiently. Our models are open-sourced at

Conclusion: 亟需设计更鲁棒的置信度表达机制，因为即使是微小的语义保留修改也可能导致误导性置信度。

Abstract: Robust verbal confidence generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for the deployment of LLMs to ensure transparency, trust, and safety in
human-AI interactions across many high-stakes applications. In this paper, we
present the first comprehensive study on the robustness of verbal confidence
under adversarial attacks. We introduce a novel framework for attacking verbal
confidence scores through both perturbation and jailbreak-based methods, and
show that these attacks can significantly jeopardize verbal confidence
estimates and lead to frequent answer changes. We examine a variety of
prompting strategies, model sizes, and application domains, revealing that
current confidence elicitation methods are vulnerable and that commonly used
defence techniques are largely ineffective or counterproductive. Our findings
underscore the urgent need to design more robust mechanisms for confidence
expression in LLMs, as even subtle semantic-preserving modifications can lead
to misleading confidence in responses.

Abstract: Translating wordplay across languages presents unique challenges that have
long confounded both professional human translators and machine translation
systems. This research proposes a novel approach for translating puns from
English to French by combining state-of-the-art large language models with
specialized techniques for wordplay generation.
  Our methodology employs a three-stage approach. First, we establish a
baseline using multiple frontier large language models with feedback based on a
new contrastive learning dataset. Second, we implement a guided
chain-of-thought pipeline with combined phonetic-semantic embeddings. Third, we
implement a multi-agent generator-discriminator framework for evaluating and
regenerating puns with feedback.
  Moving beyond the limitations of literal translation, our methodology's
primary objective is to capture the linguistic creativity and humor of the
source text wordplay, rather than simply duplicating its vocabulary. Our best
runs earned first and second place in the CLEF JOKER 2025 Task 2 competition
where they were evaluated manually by expert native French speakers.
  This research addresses a gap between translation studies and computational
linguistics by implementing linguistically-informed techniques for wordplay
translation, advancing our understanding of how language models can be
leveraged to handle the complex interplay between semantic ambiguity, phonetic
similarity, and the implicit cultural and linguistic awareness needed for
successful humor.

Motivation: KV缓存的冗余性在深层中已被证明可以减少，但在浅层中效果不足。SpindleKV基于KV缓存的高度相似性，提出了解决方案。

Method: SpindleKV结合了基于注意力权重的深层缓存淘汰方法和基于码本的浅层替换方法，同时解决了GQA问题。

Result: 实验表明，SpindleKV在两种常见基准测试和三种不同LLMs上，比基线方法更有效地减少KV缓存，同时保持或提升模型性能。

Conclusion: SpindleKV通过分层优化策略，显著提升了KV缓存减少的效果，为LLMs的推理系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive accomplishments in
recent years. However, the increasing memory consumption of KV cache has
possessed a significant challenge to the inference system. Eviction methods
have revealed the inherent redundancy within the KV cache, demonstrating its
potential for reduction, particularly in deeper layers. However, KV cache
reduction for shallower layers has been found to be insufficient. Based on our
observation that, the KV cache exhibits a high degree of similarity. Based on
this observation, we proposed a novel KV cache reduction method, SpindleKV,
which balances both shallow and deep layers. For deep layers, we employ an
attention weight based eviction method, while for shallow layers, we apply a
codebook based replacement approach which is learnt by similarity and merging
policy. Moreover, SpindleKV addressed the Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) dilemma
faced by other attention based eviction methods. Experiments on two common
benchmarks with three different LLMs shown that SpindleKV obtained better KV
cache reduction effect compared to baseline methods, while preserving similar
or even better model performance.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes
under herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which
grapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed
for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM
outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data
imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose InvestAlign,
a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging
theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather
than complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training
LLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than
using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we
develop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which
demonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT
models in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our
proposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address
complex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor
decision-making processes under herd behavior. Our code is publicly available

*Yunyang Cao,Yanjun Li,Silong Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种工业场景下复杂合同信息提取任务的高质量数据集构建方法，并基于该数据集微调了大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业合同信息提取任务需要高质量数据集，但现有方法难以满足需求。

Method: 通过聚类分析、GPT-4和GPT-3.5提取关键信息，构建高质量标注数据；利用数据增强和随机关键词生成新文本；基于高质量数据集微调大语言模型。

Result: 模型在保证高召回率和精度的同时，解析效率优异；LoRA、数据平衡和数据增强有效提升了模型准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为工业合同信息提取任务提供了新颖高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a high-quality dataset construction method for complex
contract information extraction tasks in industrial scenarios and fine-tunes a
large language model based on this dataset. Firstly, cluster analysis is
performed on industrial contract texts, and GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 are used to
extract key information from the original contract data, obtaining high-quality
data annotations. Secondly, data augmentation is achieved by constructing new
texts, and GPT-3.5 generates unstructured contract texts from randomly combined
keywords, improving model robustness. Finally, the large language model is
fine-tuned based on the high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that
the model achieves excellent overall performance while ensuring high field
recall and precision and considering parsing efficiency. LoRA, data balancing,
and data augmentation effectively enhance model accuracy and robustness. The
proposed method provides a novel and efficient solution for industrial contract
information extraction tasks.

*Juan B. Gutiérrez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将人类与大型语言模型（LLMs）视为平等节点的讨论网络模型，分析了四种无效性风险，并开发了一种数学模型和开源算法（FOO）以提高网络可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于捕捉人类与LLMs之间的实时交互，并解决LLMs中常见的无效性问题（如幻觉、逻辑错误等）。

Method: 方法包括定义无效性及其四种风险（漂移、自我修复、新编造和外部检测），开发讨论网络的数学模型，并提出FOO算法实现同行评审。

Result: 结果显示，仅依赖漂移和自我修复的网络会稳定在中等错误率；加入编造会重现当前LLMs的高错误率；而引入同行评审可将系统转向真理主导状态。

Conclusion: 结论是，新媒介的可靠性不在于单一模型的完美，而在于将不完美模型连接成相互监督的网络。

Abstract: Large-language models turn writing into a live exchange between humans and
software. We capture this new medium with a discursive-network model that
treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements
circulate. Broadening the focus from isolated hallucinations, we define
invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows
four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external
detection. A general mathematical model of discursive networks is developed to
provide valuable insights: A network governed only by drift and self-repair
stabilizes at a modest error rate; adding fabrication reproduces the high rates
seen in current LLMs. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer
review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer
review with the open-source \emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a
configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a
harmoniser merges their verdicts. The takeaway is practical and cultural:
reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from
wiring imperfect ones into networks that keep each other honest.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多模态知识图谱与生成式AI的食品领域QA框架，显著提升了性能与多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决食品领域问答系统中知识整合与多模态生成的挑战，提升可靠性与多样性。

Method: 构建大规模多模态知识图谱（MMKG），结合LLaMA和Stable Diffusion进行联合微调，并采用混合检索-生成策略。

Result: BERTScore提升16.2%，FID降低37.8%，CLIP对齐提升31.1%，图像重用准确率达94.1%，合成充分性达85%。

Conclusion: 结构化知识与多模态生成结合显著提升了食品QA的可靠性与多样性。

Abstract: We propose a unified food-domain QA framework that combines a large-scale
multimodal knowledge graph (MMKG) with generative AI. Our MMKG links 13,000
recipes, 3,000 ingredients, 140,000 relations, and 14,000 images. We generate
40,000 QA pairs using 40 templates and LLaVA/DeepSeek augmentation. Joint
fine-tuning of Meta LLaMA 3.1-8B and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Large improves
BERTScore by 16.2\%, reduces FID by 37.8\%, and boosts CLIP alignment by
31.1\%. Diagnostic analyses-CLIP-based mismatch detection (35.2\% to 7.3\%) and
LLaVA-driven hallucination checks-ensure factual and visual fidelity. A hybrid
retrieval-generation strategy achieves 94.1\% accurate image reuse and 85\%
adequacy in synthesis. Our results demonstrate that structured knowledge and
multimodal generation together enhance reliability and diversity in food QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Gated Memory Unit (GMU)的机制，用于在State Space Models (SSMs)中实现层间内存共享，并构建了SambaY架构，显著提升了解码效率和长上下文性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合架构如Samba和YOCO未充分探索SSM层间表示共享的效率潜力，因此需要一种更高效的机制。

Method: 引入GMU机制，构建SambaY架构，结合Samba和YOCO的优势，并通过Differential Attention增强模型性能。

Result: SambaY在解码效率、长上下文性能和可扩展性上显著优于基线模型，Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning在推理任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: GMU和SambaY架构为高效序列建模提供了新思路，展示了在大规模计算环境下的优越性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated the effectiveness of
State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. While hybrid
architectures such as Samba and the decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, have
shown promising performance gains over Transformers, prior works have not
investigated the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM
layers. In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet
effective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers. We apply it to
create SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture that incorporates GMUs in
the cross-decoder to share memory readout states from a Samba-based
self-decoder. SambaY significantly enhances decoding efficiency, preserves
linear pre-filling time complexity, and boosts long-context performance, all
while eliminating the need for explicit positional encoding. Through extensive
scaling experiments, we demonstrate that our model exhibits a significantly
lower irreducible loss compared to a strong YOCO baseline, indicating superior
performance scalability under large-scale compute regimes. Our largest model
enhanced with Differential Attention, Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning, achieves
significantly better performance than Phi4-mini-Reasoning on reasoning tasks
such as Math500, AIME24/25, and GPQA Diamond without any reinforcement
learning, while delivering up to 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length
prompts with 32K generation length under the vLLM inference framework. We

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FuDoBa是一种基于贝叶斯优化的方法，将LLM嵌入与领域特定知识结合，生成低维、任务相关的表示，提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成的高维嵌入在领域特定应用中过于通用或低效的问题。

Method: 通过贝叶斯优化整合LLM嵌入与本地及外部知识（如WikiData），生成低维表示。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优于或与专有LLM嵌入基线相当。

Conclusion: FuDoBa能有效结合领域知识，提升分类性能并降低计算复杂度。

Abstract: Building on the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based
representations have dominated the document representation landscape, achieving
great performance on the document embedding benchmarks. However, the
high-dimensional, computationally expensive embeddings from LLMs tend to be
either too generic or inefficient for domain-specific applications. To address
these limitations, we introduce FuDoBa a Bayesian optimisation-based method
that integrates LLM-based embeddings with domain-specific structured knowledge,
sourced both locally and from external repositories like WikiData. This fusion
produces low-dimensional, task-relevant representations while reducing training
complexity and yielding interpretable early-fusion weights for enhanced
classification performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
six datasets in two domains, showing that when paired with robust AutoML-based
classifiers, our proposed representation learning approach performs on par
with, or surpasses, those produced solely by the proprietary LLM-based
embedding baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决数据提取阶段的资源密集问题，探索利用大型语言模型（LLM）和审查协议提高效率的可能性。

Method: 使用Claude 3.5 Sonnet和审查协议对10个证据源进行数据提取，并评估其性能。

Result: 简单数据提取准确率高（83.3%和100%），复杂数据提取准确率低（9.6%和15.8%）。总体精度>90%，但召回率和F1分数较低。

Conclusion: LLM在数据提取中表现有限，需进一步评估和比较传统方法。建议研究人员在使用时评估并报告LLM性能。

Abstract: The data extraction stages of reviews are resource-intensive, and researchers
may seek to expediate data extraction using online (large language models) LLMs
and review protocols. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to trial two approaches that
used a review protocol to prompt data extraction from 10 evidence sources
included in a case study scoping review. A protocol-based approach was also
used to review extracted data. Limited performance evaluation was undertaken
which found high accuracy for the two extraction approaches (83.3% and 100%)
when extracting simple, well-defined citation details; accuracy was lower (9.6%
and 15.8%) when extracting more complex, subjective data items. Considering all
data items, both approaches had precision >90% but low recall (<25%) and F1
scores (<40%). The context of a complex scoping review, open response types and
methodological approach likely impacted performance due to missed and
misattributed data. LLM feedback considered the baseline extraction accurate
and suggested minor amendments: four of 15 (26.7%) to citation details and 8 of
38 (21.1%) to key findings data items were considered to potentially add value.
However, when repeating the process with a dataset featuring deliberate errors,
only 2 of 39 (5%) errors were detected. Review-protocol-based methods used for
expediency require more robust performance evaluation across a range of LLMs
and review contexts with comparison to conventional prompt engineering
approaches. We recommend researchers evaluate and report LLM performance if
using them similarly to conduct data extraction or review extracted data. LLM
feedback contributed to protocol adaptation and may assist future review
protocol drafting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是量化政治精英间的相互敌意，以更好地理解精英极化现象。

Method: 方法包括分析议会演讲中政治人物提及彼此的情况，记录发言者和被提及者，并评估情感倾向。

Result: 结果显示该方法能有效捕捉精英极化，且对选举活动、政党危机等事件反应敏感。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法为欧盟范围内的精英极化研究提供了新的数据基础。

Abstract: This project introduces a new measure of elite polarization via actor and
subject detection using artificial intelligence. I identify when politicians
mention one another in parliamentary speeches, note who is speaking and who is
being addressed, and assess the emotional temperature behind these evaluations.
This maps how elites evaluate their various out-parties, allowing us to create
an index of mutual out-party hostility, that is, elite polarization. While I
analyzed polarization data over the past four decades for the UK, and two
decades for Hungary and Italy, my approach lays the groundwork for a
twenty-year, EU-wide time-series dataset on elite polarization. I obtain the
results that can be aggregated by party and quarter. The resulting index
demonstrates a good face validity: it reacts to events such as electoral
campaigns, country- and party-level crises, and to parties losing and assuming
power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床文本生成中因数据分散和语义密集导致的上下文长度限制和信息遗漏问题。

Method: 提出CLI-RAG框架，结合分层分块策略和双阶段检索机制（全局阶段识别相关笔记类型，局部阶段提取高价值内容）。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上生成结构化进度笔记，平均对齐分数达87.7%，优于临床医生撰写的笔记（80.7%）。

Conclusion: CLI-RAG框架在临床文本生成中表现出高效性和一致性，为临床应用的可靠性和可重复性提供了支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), including zero-shot and few-shot paradigms,
have shown promising capabilities in clinical text generation. However,
real-world applications face two key challenges: (1) patient data is highly
unstructured, heterogeneous, and scattered across multiple note types and (2)
clinical notes are often long and semantically dense, making naive prompting
infeasible due to context length constraints and the risk of omitting
clinically relevant information.
  We introduce CLI-RAG (Clinically Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a
domain-specific framework for structured and clinically grounded text
generation using LLMs. It incorporates a novel hierarchical chunking strategy
that respects clinical document structure and introduces a task-specific
dual-stage retrieval mechanism. The global stage identifies relevant note types
using evidence-based queries, while the local stage extracts high-value content
within those notes creating relevance at both document and section levels.
  We apply the system to generate structured progress notes for individual
hospital visits using 15 clinical note types from the MIMIC-III dataset.
Experiments show that it preserves temporal and semantic alignment across
visits, achieving an average alignment score of 87.7%, surpassing the 80.7%
baseline from real clinician-authored notes. The generated outputs also
demonstrate high consistency across LLMs, reinforcing deterministic behavior
essential for reproducibility, reliability, and clinical trust.

Motivation: 研究LLMs内部如何表示和处理不确定性，以防止幻觉并提升模型可靠性。

Method: 使用Tuned Lens（Logit Lens的变体）分析11个数据集和5个模型的层间概率轨迹，比较确定性和不确定性预测的动态。

Result: 确定性和不确定性预测的层间概率轨迹高度一致，不确定性未显著影响推理动态。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，简单方法可能无法有效检测不确定性，同时展示了可解释性方法在研究不确定性影响推理中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) internally represent and
process their predictions is central to detecting uncertainty and preventing
hallucinations. While several studies have shown that models encode uncertainty
in their hidden states, it is underexplored how this affects the way they
process such hidden states. In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamics of
output token probabilities across layers for certain and uncertain outputs are
largely aligned, revealing that uncertainty does not seem to affect inference
dynamics. Specifically, we use the Tuned Lens, a variant of the Logit Lens, to
analyze the layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens
across 11 datasets and 5 models. Using incorrect predictions as those with
higher epistemic uncertainty, our results show aligned trajectories for certain
and uncertain predictions that both observe abrupt increases in confidence at
similar layers. We balance this finding by showing evidence that more competent
models may learn to process uncertainty differently. Our findings challenge the
feasibility of leveraging simplistic methods for detecting uncertainty at
inference. More broadly, our work demonstrates how interpretability methods may
be used to investigate the way uncertainty affects inference.

classification, and imbalanced multiclass ethnic language identification. We
investigate various embedding configurations, comparing random to fastText
embeddings in both static and fine-tuned settings, with embedding dimensions of
100 and 300 using CBOW and Skip-gram models. Baselines include standard CNNs
and CNNs augmented with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CNN-KAN). In addition, we
investigated KAConvText with different classification heads - MLP and KAN,
where using KAN head supports enhanced interpretability. Results show that
KAConvText-MLP with fine-tuned fastText embeddings achieves the best
performance of 91.23% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9109) for hate speech detection,

Conclusion: CE-Judge是一种高效、低成本的多语言文本评估方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Automated text evaluation has long been a central issue in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Recently, the field has shifted toward using Large Language
Models (LLMs) as evaluators-a trend known as the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. While
promising and easily adaptable across tasks, this approach has seen limited
exploration in multilingual contexts. Existing multilingual studies often rely
on proprietary models or require extensive training data for fine-tuning,
raising concerns about cost, time, and efficiency. In this paper, we propose
Checklist Engineering based LLM-as-a-Judge (CE-Judge), a training-free
framework that uses checklist intuition for multilingual evaluation with an
open-source model. Experiments across multiple languages and three benchmark
datasets, under both pointwise and pairwise settings, show that our method
generally surpasses the baselines and performs on par with the GPT-4o model.

Motivation: 开源大语言模型（LLMs）为企业应用提供了机会，但许多组织缺乏部署和维护大规模模型的基础设施，因此小型LLMs（sLLMs）成为实用替代方案。然而，其性能限制和领域适应方法的商业应用潜力尚未充分研究。

Method: 采用领域自适应持续预训练（DACP）方法，验证其在多种基础模型和服务领域的有效性，并通过实验和实际评估进行分析。

Result: 实验表明，应用DACP的sLLMs在目标领域表现显著提升，同时保持了通用能力。

Conclusion: DACP为sLLMs提供了一种经济高效且可扩展的企业级部署方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded
opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still
lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result,
small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent
performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has
been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in
commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the
effectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models
and service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations,
we demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target
domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a
cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.

Abstract: This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of
engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and
expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational
model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of
interest and an input document describing the specific system. This strategy is
implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language
diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies,
attributes, and operations of components. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to
improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such
as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and
key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram
generation. The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is
illustrated with different case studies. The computational models of complex
dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and
computational model generation steps. In the code generation step, NLP
strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only.
The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or
computational software. The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via
an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved
performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.

Result: 语义熵（SE）与准确性呈强负相关，可作为推理质量的稳健指标。

Conclusion: 提出的协作推理框架和语义熵（SE）有效解决了现有推理方法的局限性，提升了推理效率和质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress
toward artificial general intelligence, with inference-time scaling emerging as
a key technique. Contemporary approaches leverage either sequential reasoning
(iteratively extending chains of thought) or parallel reasoning (generating
multiple solutions simultaneously) to scale inference. However, both paradigms
face fundamental limitations: sequential scaling typically relies on arbitrary
token budgets for termination, leading to inefficiency or premature cutoff;
while parallel scaling often lacks coordination among parallel branches and
requires intrusive fine-tuning to perform effectively. In light of these
challenges, we aim to design a flexible test-time collaborative inference
framework that exploits the complementary strengths of both sequential and
parallel reasoning paradigms. Towards this goal, the core challenge lies in
developing an efficient and accurate intrinsic quality metric to assess model
responses during collaborative inference, enabling dynamic control and early
termination of the reasoning trace. To address this challenge, we introduce
semantic entropy (SE), which quantifies the semantic diversity of parallel
model responses and serves as a robust indicator of reasoning quality due to
its strong negative correlation with accuracy...

Abstract: Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) must ensure that retrieved
passages are not only individually relevant but also collectively form a
comprehensive set. Existing approaches primarily rerank top-k passages based on
their individual relevance, often failing to meet the information needs of
complex queries in multi-hop question answering. In this work, we propose a
set-wise passage selection approach and introduce SETR, which explicitly
identifies the information requirements of a query through Chain-of-Thought

Result: 揭示了AI评估需要专门的基础设施、统计严谨性和社区协作。

Conclusion: AI评估需超越传统软件开发实践，结合基础设施、统计方法和社区协作。

Abstract: AI evaluations have become critical tools for assessing large language model
capabilities and safety. This paper presents practical insights from eight
months of maintaining $inspect\_evals$, an open-source repository of 70+
community-contributed AI evaluations. We identify key challenges in
implementing and maintaining AI evaluations and develop solutions including:
(1) a structured cohort management framework for scaling community
contributions, (2) statistical methodologies for optimal resampling and
cross-model comparison with uncertainty quantification, and (3) systematic
quality control processes for reproducibility. Our analysis reveals that AI
evaluation requires specialized infrastructure, statistical rigor, and
community coordination beyond traditional software development practices.

TL;DR: SCoRE是一种模块化、低成本的句子级关系抽取系统，结合对比学习和贝叶斯kNN分类器，适应性强且能抵抗噪声，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足知识图谱（KG）扩展的需求，特别是在低监督设置下，需要适应性强且能抵抗噪声的关系抽取（RE）解决方案。

Method: SCoRE系统结合监督对比学习和贝叶斯kNN分类器，支持多标签分类，无需微调且易于切换预训练语言模型（PLM）。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，SCoRE性能匹配或超越现有方法，同时显著降低能耗。

Conclusion: SCoRE凭借高效、模块化和可扩展性，成为现实世界RE应用的理想选择。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient knowledge graph (KG) enrichment leveraging
external corpora has intensified interest in relation extraction (RE),
particularly under low-supervision settings. To address the need for adaptable
and noise-resilient RE solutions that integrate seamlessly with pre-trained
large language models (PLMs), we introduce SCoRE, a modular and cost-effective
sentence-level RE system. SCoRE enables easy PLM switching, requires no
finetuning, and adapts smoothly to diverse corpora and KGs. By combining
supervised contrastive learning with a Bayesian k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
classifier for multi-label classification, it delivers robust performance
despite the noisy annotations of distantly supervised corpora. To improve RE
evaluation, we propose two novel metrics: Correlation Structure Distance (CSD),
measuring the alignment between learned relational patterns and KG structures,
and Precision at R (P@R), assessing utility as a recommender system. We also
release Wiki20d, a benchmark dataset replicating real-world RE conditions where
only KG-derived annotations are available. Experiments on five benchmarks show
that SCoRE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing energy consumption. Further analyses reveal that increasing model
complexity, as seen in prior work, degrades performance, highlighting the
advantages of SCoRE's minimal design. Combining efficiency, modularity, and
scalability, SCoRE stands as an optimal choice for real-world RE applications.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了GUI代理在视觉接地过程中存在后门攻击漏洞，并提出了一种名为VisualTrap的攻击方法，能够通过少量污染数据和高隐蔽性视觉触发器劫持代理行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI代理与个人设备的紧密集成带来了安全风险，尤其是后门攻击的威胁尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出VisualTrap方法，通过在视觉接地预训练阶段注入污染数据，误导代理将文本计划映射到触发位置而非目标位置。

Result: 实验表明，仅需5%的污染数据和隐蔽视觉触发器即可有效劫持代理行为，且攻击可泛化到下游任务和不同GUI环境。

Conclusion: 研究强调了GUI代理后门攻击风险的紧迫性，呼吁进一步研究相关防御措施。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine
interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile
phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks
in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices
raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor
attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual
grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce
vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack
targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when
given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose
VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to
locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.
VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and
does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical
feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can
effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and
highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack
can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover,
the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments,
e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.
These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor
attack risks in GUI agents.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of memes on social media has highlighted the urgent need
for effective approaches to detect harmful content. However, traditional
data-driven approaches struggle to detect new memes due to their evolving
nature and the lack of up-to-date annotated data. To address this issue, we
propose MIND, a multi-agent framework for zero-shot harmful meme detection that
does not rely on annotated data. MIND implements three key strategies: 1) We
retrieve similar memes from an unannotated reference set to provide contextual
information. 2) We propose a bi-directional insight derivation mechanism to
extract a comprehensive understanding of similar memes. 3) We then employ a
multi-agent debate mechanism to ensure robust decision-making through reasoned
arbitration. Extensive experiments on three meme datasets demonstrate that our
proposed framework not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches but also
shows strong generalization across different model architectures and parameter
scales, providing a scalable solution for harmful meme detection. The code is

Method: 引入MPMCP数据集，评估四种法律场景下不同LLMs的性能，包括指控预测和刑期预测任务。

Result: 多被告多指控场景（S4）最具挑战性，不同模型表现差异显著，如InternLM2和Lawformer在S4中F1分数分别下降4.5%和19.7%。

Conclusion: 多被告多指控场景对法律判决预测模型提出了更高要求，未来研究需进一步优化模型性能。

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction offers a compelling method to aid legal
practitioners and researchers. However, the research question remains
relatively under-explored: Should multiple defendants and charges be treated
separately in LJP? To address this, we introduce a new dataset namely
multi-person multi-charge prediction (MPMCP), and seek the answer by evaluating
the performance of several prevailing legal large language models (LLMs) on
four practical legal judgment scenarios: (S1) single defendant with a single
charge, (S2) single defendant with multiple charges, (S3) multiple defendants
with a single charge, and (S4) multiple defendants with multiple charges. We
evaluate the dataset across two LJP tasks, i.e., charge prediction and penalty
term prediction. We have conducted extensive experiments and found that the
scenario involving multiple defendants and multiple charges (S4) poses the
greatest challenges, followed by S2, S3, and S1. The impact varies
significantly depending on the model. For example, in S4 compared to S1,
InternLM2 achieves approximately 4.5% lower F1-score and 2.8% higher LogD,
while Lawformer demonstrates around 19.7% lower F1-score and 19.0% higher LogD.

Method: 使用两个数学辅导对话数据集，评估Llama 3和GPT-4o在预测导师策略和学生表现上的表现。

Result: 即使是最先进的大语言模型也难以准确预测导师策略，但导师策略对学生表现有显著影响。

Conclusion: 需要更强大的方法来预测导师策略及其对学生表现的影响。

Abstract: Tutoring dialogues have gained significant attention in recent years, given
the prominence of online learning and the emerging tutoring abilities of
artificial intelligence (AI) agents powered by large language models (LLMs).
Recent studies have shown that the strategies used by tutors can have
significant effects on student outcomes, necessitating methods to predict how
tutors will behave and how their actions impact students. However, few works
have studied predicting tutor strategy in dialogues. Therefore, in this work we
investigate the ability of modern LLMs, particularly Llama 3 and GPT-4o, to
predict both future tutor moves and student outcomes in dialogues, using two
math tutoring dialogue datasets. We find that even state-of-the-art LLMs
struggle to predict future tutor strategy while tutor strategy is highly
indicative of student outcomes, outlining a need for more powerful methods to
approach this task.

Motivation: 现有代码生成评估套件（如HumanEval和LiveCodeBench）的测试用例数量有限且同质化，导致性能评估不准确，影响强化学习框架中的奖励估计。

Method: 提出多维度指标量化测试套件的全面性，并引入SAGA方法，结合人类编程经验和LLM推理能力，提升测试用例的覆盖率和质量。

Result: SAGA在TCGBench上的检测率达到90.62%，验证器准确率为32.58%，比LiveCodeBench-v6高10.78%。

Conclusion: SAGA为可靠的LLM代码评估提供了可扩展的基础，推动了代码生成中RLVR的发展，并为自动化对抗测试和自适应基准集成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in
code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench. However, a
detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a
limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going
undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also
compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks
utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we
systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing
multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite
thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method
(SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability,
aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated
test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the
TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a
verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc)
of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78%
higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building
a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR
in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis
and adaptive benchmark integration.

Result: 常见检索器性能在查询微小变化下显著下降，实验结果为实践者提供改进建议。

Conclusion: RAG系统对查询扰动敏感，需优化检索器设计以提高鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are very costly and inefficient to update with
new information. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) has been proposed as a solution that dynamically incorporates external
knowledge during inference, improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations. Despite its promise, RAG systems face practical challenges-most
notably, a strong dependence on the quality of the input query for accurate
retrieval. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of different
components in the RAG pipeline to various types of query perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that the performance of commonly used retrievers can degrade
significantly even under minor query variations. We study each module in
isolation as well as their combined effect in an end-to-end question answering
setting, using both general-domain and domain-specific datasets. Additionally,
we propose an evaluation framework to systematically assess the query-level
robustness of RAG pipelines and offer actionable recommendations for
practitioners based on the results of more than 1092 experiments we performed.

text. FRaN-X comprises a two-stage system that combines sequence labeling with
fine-grained role classification to reveal how entities are portrayed as
protagonists, antagonists, or innocents, using a unique taxonomy of 22
fine-grained roles nested under these three main categories. The system
supports five languages (Bulgarian, English, Hindi, Russian, and Portuguese)
and two domains (the Russia-Ukraine Conflict and Climate Change). It provides
an interactive web interface for media analysts to explore and compare framing
across different sources, tackling the challenge of automatically detecting and
labeling how entities are framed. Our system allows end users to focus on a
single article as well as analyze up to four articles simultaneously. We
provide aggregate level analysis including an intuitive graph visualization
that highlights the narrative a group of articles are pushing. Our system
includes a search feature for users to look up entities of interest, along with
a timeline view that allows analysts to track an entity's role transitions
across different contexts within the article. The FRaN-X system and the trained

Motivation: 解决在受监管行业中敏感或受保护数据的共享和利用问题，同时尊重数据所有者的偏好。

Method: 采用混合专家（MoE）架构，专家独立训练于封闭数据集，通过领域感知路由集成，无需联合训练。

Result: 在31个下游任务中，FlexOlmo平均相对提升41%，优于现有模型合并方法10.1%，且性能超过标准MoE。

Conclusion: FlexOlmo为数据所有者和研究者提供了在保护数据隐私的同时利用封闭数据的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce FlexOlmo, a new class of language models (LMs) that supports (1)
distributed training without data sharing, where different model parameters are
independently trained on closed datasets, and (2) data-flexible inference,
where these parameters along with their associated data can be flexibly
included or excluded from model inferences with no further training. FlexOlmo
employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained
independently on closed datasets and later integrated through a new
domain-informed routing without any joint training. FlexOlmo is trained on
FlexMix, a corpus we curate comprising publicly available datasets alongside
seven domain-specific sets, representing realistic approximations of closed
sets. We evaluate models with up to 37 billion parameters (20 billion active)
on 31 diverse downstream tasks. We show that a general expert trained on public
data can be effectively combined with independently trained experts from other
data owners, leading to an average 41% relative improvement while allowing
users to opt out of certain data based on data licensing or permission
requirements. Our approach also outperforms prior model merging methods by
10.1% on average and surpasses the standard MoE trained without data
restrictions using the same training FLOPs. Altogether, this research presents
a solution for both data owners and researchers in regulated industries with
sensitive or protected data. FlexOlmo enables benefiting from closed data while
respecting data owners' preferences by keeping their data local and supporting
fine-grained control of data access during inference.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of conversational search systems revolutionizes how
information is accessed by enabling the multi-turn interaction between the user
and the system. Existing conversational search systems are usually built with
two different models. This separation restricts the system from leveraging the
intrinsic knowledge of the models simultaneously, which cannot ensure the
effectiveness of retrieval benefiting the generation. The existing studies for
developing unified models cannot fully address the aspects of understanding
conversational context, managing retrieval independently, and generating
responses. In this paper, we explore how to unify dense retrieval and response
generation for large language models in conversation. We conduct joint
fine-tuning with different objectives and design two mechanisms to reduce the
inconsistency risks while mitigating data discrepancy. The evaluations on five
conversational search datasets demonstrate that our unified model can mutually
improve both tasks and outperform the existing baselines.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models,
achieving state-of-the-art results in continuous data domains such as image and
video generation. Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process
that gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution,
followed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful
in continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly
natural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and
the lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility
and performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation.
Specifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To
assess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative
Log-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.
  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a
mean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of
4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches
per sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were
conducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with
a fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a
detailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting
trade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the
promise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting
future work in non-autoregressive language generation.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和泛化能力上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合CLIP感知和课程对比正则化能有效提升水下图像增强的感知质量和内容恢复效果。

Abstract: High-quality underwater images are essential for both machine vision tasks
and viewers with their aesthetic appeal.However, the quality of underwater
images is severely affected by light absorption and scattering. Deep
learning-based methods for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) have achieved
good performance. However, these methods often overlook considering human
perception and lack sufficient constraints within the solution space.
Consequently, the enhanced images often suffer from diminished perceptual
quality or poor content restoration.To address these issues, we propose a UIE
method with a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perception loss
module and curriculum contrastive regularization. Above all, to develop a
perception model for underwater images that more aligns with human visual
perception, the visual semantic feature extraction capability of the CLIP model
is leveraged to learn an appropriate prompt pair to map and evaluate the
quality of underwater images. This CLIP perception model is then incorporated
as a perception loss module into the enhancement network to improve the
perceptual quality of enhanced images. Furthermore, the CLIP perception model
is integrated with the curriculum contrastive regularization to enhance the
constraints imposed on the enhanced images within the CLIP perceptual space,
mitigating the risk of both under-enhancement and over-enhancement.
Specifically, the CLIP perception model is employed to assess and categorize
the learning difficulty level of negatives in the regularization process,
ensuring comprehensive and nuanced utilization of distorted images and
negatives with varied quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and
generalization ability.

Motivation: 解决不同AI模型因独立表示导致的概念空间不兼容问题，提升跨模型可解释性。

Conclusion: SPARC为跨模型和模态的概念对齐提供了有效解决方案，并支持实际应用如文本引导的空间定位。

Abstract: Understanding how different AI models encode the same high-level concepts,
such as objects or attributes, remains challenging because each model typically
produces its own isolated representation. Existing interpretability methods
like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each
model, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model
interpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for
Aligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,
unified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,
vision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is
enforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,
ensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given
concept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages
semantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically
improves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than
tripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared
sparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar
high-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of

### [47] [A Probabilistic Approach to Uncertainty Quantification Leveraging 3D Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06269)
*Rushil Desai,Frederik Warburg,Trevor Darrell,Marissa Ramirez de Chanlatte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BayesSDF提出了一种新的概率框架，用于量化神经隐式SDF模型中的不确定性，解决了现有方法的计算效率低和几何不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学模拟应用（如森林中的流体模拟）需要精确的表面几何和不确定性量化，现有方法缺乏直接几何集成。

Method: BayesSDF利用拉普拉斯近似，通过基于Hessian的指标量化局部表面不稳定性，实现高效且表面感知的不确定性估计。

Result: 实验表明，BayesSDF在校准和几何一致性上优于现有方法，为不确定性感知的3D重建和模拟提供了可靠基础。

Conclusion: BayesSDF为神经隐式SDF模型的不确定性量化提供了高效且几何一致的方法，适用于物理建模和机器人决策。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D representations, particularly
those utilizing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), remains a substantial
challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and
geometric inconsistencies. Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric
integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce
BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in
neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications
with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through
forests, where precise surface geometry and awareness of fidelity surface
geometric uncertainty are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as NeRF
or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, SDFs define
continuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical
modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a Laplace approximation to quantify
local surface instability via Hessian-based metrics, enabling computationally
efficient, surface-aware uncertainty estimation. Our method shows that
uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed geometry,
providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BayesSDF
outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric consistency,
establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction,
simulation, and robotic decision-making.

TL;DR: LIRA框架通过结合语义增强特征提取器（SEFE）和交错局部视觉耦合（ILVC），解决了大型多模态模型（LMMs）在分割和理解任务中的不准确和幻觉问题，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在分割和理解任务中存在不准确和幻觉问题，主要源于视觉理解能力不足和细粒度感知缺失。

Method: 提出LIRA框架，包含SEFE（融合语义和像素级特征）和ILVC（基于分割掩码生成局部描述），并引入AttrEval数据集量化语义推断能力。

Result: LIRA在分割和理解任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LIRA通过结合视觉理解和分割的互补关系，有效解决了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in
segmentation and comprehension, they still struggle with two limitations:
inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem
primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of
fine-grained perception. To alleviate these limitations, we propose LIRA, a
framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual
comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced
Feature Extractor (SEFE) improves object attribute inference by fusing semantic
and pixel-level features, leading to more accurate segmentation; (2)
Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) autoregressively generates local
descriptions after extracting local features based on segmentation masks,
offering fine-grained supervision to mitigate hallucinations. Furthermore, we
find that the precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with
the latent related semantics of the <seg> token. To quantify this relationship
and the model's potential semantic inferring ability, we introduce the
Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset. Our experiments show that LIRA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension
tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/echo840/LIRA.

Abstract: Offline Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems play a crucial role in
applications such as historical document digitization, automatic form
processing, and biometric authentication. However, their performance is often
hindered by the limited availability of annotated training data, particularly
for low-resource languages and complex scripts. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of offline handwritten data augmentation and generation
techniques designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of HTR systems. We
systematically examine traditional augmentation methods alongside recent
advances in deep learning, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
diffusion models, and transformer-based approaches. Furthermore, we explore the
challenges associated with generating diverse and realistic handwriting
samples, particularly in preserving script authenticity and addressing data
scarcity. This survey follows the PRISMA methodology, ensuring a structured and
rigorous selection process. Our analysis began with 1,302 primary studies,
which were filtered down to 848 after removing duplicates, drawing from key
academic sources such as IEEE Digital Library, Springer Link, Science Direct,
and ACM Digital Library. By evaluating existing datasets, assessment metrics,
and state-of-the-art methodologies, this survey identifies key research gaps
and proposes future directions to advance the field of handwritten text
generation across diverse linguistic and stylistic landscapes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CCPDA的数据增强方法，用于改善野火分割模型的训练效果，特别是在火类分割上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于收集和标注图像用于训练分割模型成本高昂，且野火科学领域缺乏可靠的公开标注数据集，因此需要一种有效的数据增强方法。

Method: CCPDA方法包括三个步骤：识别源图像中的火簇、通过中心化技术聚焦火区核心、将精炼后的火簇粘贴到目标图像上。

Result: 通过数值分析和多目标优化比较，CCPDA显著提升了火类分割性能，优于其他增强方法。

Conclusion: CCPDA有效缓解了小规模标注数据集的训练难题，尤其在火类分割上表现突出。

Abstract: Collecting and annotating images for the purpose of training segmentation
models is often cost prohibitive. In the domain of wildland fire science, this
challenge is further compounded by the scarcity of reliable public datasets
with labeled ground truth. This paper presents the Centralized Copy-Paste Data
Augmentation (CCPDA) method, for the purpose of assisting with the training of
deep-learning multiclass segmentation models, with special focus on improving
segmentation outcomes for the fire-class. CCPDA has three main steps: (i)
identify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization
technique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined
fire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity
while preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class. The
effectiveness of this augmentation technique is demonstrated via numerical
analysis and comparison against various other augmentation methods using a
weighted sum-based multi-objective optimization approach. This approach helps
elevate segmentation performance metrics specific to the fire class, which
carries significantly more operational significance than other classes (fuel,
ash, or background). Numerical performance assessment validates the efficacy of
the presented CCPDA method in alleviating the difficulties associated with
small, manually labeled training datasets. It also illustrates that CCPDA
outperforms other augmentation strategies in the application scenario
considered, particularly in improving fire-class segmentation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在常见损坏（如噪声、模糊、天气和数字失真）下性能显著下降，限制了其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: AR2通过迭代修复策略，交替进行CAM引导的细化和标准微调，以对齐干净和损坏图像的CAMs。

Result: AR2在标准损坏基准测试（CIFAR-10-C、CIFAR-100-C和ImageNet-C）上优于现有方法，平衡了干净数据的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AR2为增强模型在多样化损坏环境中的可靠性提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks suffer from significant performance degradation when
exposed to common corruptions such as noise, blur, weather, and digital
distortions, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. In this
paper, we propose AR2 (Attention-Guided Repair for Robustness), a simple yet
effective method to enhance the corruption robustness of pretrained CNNs. AR2
operates by explicitly aligning the class activation maps (CAMs) between clean
and corrupted images, encouraging the model to maintain consistent attention
even under input perturbations. Our approach follows an iterative repair
strategy that alternates between CAM-guided refinement and standard
fine-tuning, without requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments
show that AR2 consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
restoring robustness on standard corruption benchmarks (CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C
and ImageNet-C), achieving a favorable balance between accuracy on clean data
and corruption robustness. These results demonstrate that AR2 provides a robust
and scalable solution for enhancing model reliability in real-world
environments with diverse corruptions.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is essential for
applications in healthcare, fitness, and human-computer interaction.
Bio-impedance sensing offers unique advantages for fine-grained motion capture
but remains underutilized due to the scarcity of labeled data. We introduce
SImpHAR, a novel framework addressing this limitation through two core
contributions. First, we propose a simulation pipeline that generates realistic
bio-impedance signals from 3D human meshes using shortest-path estimation,
soft-body physics, and text-to-motion generation serving as a digital twin for
data augmentation. Second, we design a two-stage training strategy with
decoupled approach that enables broader activity coverage without requiring
label-aligned synthetic data. We evaluate SImpHAR on our collected ImpAct
dataset and two public benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods, with gains of up to 22.3% and 21.8%, in terms of
accuracy and macro F1 score, respectively. Our results highlight the promise of
simulation-driven augmentation and modular training for impedance-based HAR.

Result: 在THUMOS14、ActivityNet-1.3和HACS数据集上分别优于现有方法2.8%、1.2%和4.8%。

Conclusion: PCL-Former通过模块化设计和专用损失函数，显著提升了时间动作定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Inspired by the recent success of transformers and multi-stage architectures
in video recognition and object detection domains. We thoroughly explore the
rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage
architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This
exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer
architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated
transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the
Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may
contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories
within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the
temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate
the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three
challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments.
We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each
individual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate
the effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art
TAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决穿戴式相机连续处理RGB图像的高功耗、大数据量、隐私问题和计算资源需求。

Method: 结合低分辨率热成像数据动态调整RGB帧采样率，并利用热信号定位感兴趣区域（手部互动）。

Result: 仅需3%的原始RGB数据，活动识别F1分数达95%，与全视频（94%）相当。

Conclusion: THOR为实时监测手部活动和健康风险行为提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Wearable cameras are increasingly used as an observational and interventional
tool for human behaviors by providing detailed visual data of hand-related
activities. This data can be leveraged to facilitate memory recall for logging
of behavior or timely interventions aimed at improving health. However,
continuous processing of RGB images from these cameras consumes significant
power impacting battery lifetime, generates a large volume of unnecessary video
data for post-processing, raises privacy concerns, and requires substantial
computational resources for real-time analysis. We introduce THOR, a real-time
adaptive spatio-temporal RGB frame sampling method that leverages thermal
sensing to capture hand-object patches and classify them in real-time. We use
low-resolution thermal camera data to identify moments when a person switches
from one hand-related activity to another, and adjust the RGB frame sampling
rate by increasing it during activity transitions and reducing it during
periods of sustained activity. Additionally, we use the thermal cues from the
hand to localize the region of interest (i.e., the hand-object interaction) in
each RGB frame, allowing the system to crop and process only the necessary part
of the image for activity recognition. We develop a wearable device to validate
our method through an in-the-wild study with 14 participants and over 30
activities, and further evaluate it on Ego4D (923 participants across 9
countries, totaling 3,670 hours of video). Our results show that using only 3%
of the original RGB video data, our method captures all the activity segments,
and achieves hand-related activity recognition F1-score (95%) comparable to
using the entire RGB video (94%). Our work provides a more practical path for
the longitudinal use of wearable cameras to monitor hand-related activities and
health-risk behaviors in real time.

Result: 在SEFD数据集上，模型精度与YOLO-v4相当，但参数减少35.5倍；在嵌入式平台上实现8至44.8 FPS的高帧率，比现有技术快87.84倍。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了事件相机的实时边缘计算性能，适用于低功耗、高速应用场景。

Abstract: High-speed vision sensing is essential for real-time perception in
applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.
Traditional frame-based vision systems suffer from motion blur, high latency,
and redundant data processing, limiting their performance in dynamic
environments. Event cameras, which capture asynchronous brightness changes at
the pixel level, offer a promising alternative but pose challenges in object
detection due to sparse and noisy event streams. To address this, we propose an
event autoencoder architecture that efficiently compresses and reconstructs
event data while preserving critical spatial and temporal features. The
proposed model employs convolutional encoding and incorporates adaptive
threshold selection and a lightweight classifier to enhance recognition
accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the
existing Smart Event Face Dataset (SEFD) demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable accuracy to the YOLO-v4 model while utilizing up to $35.5\times$
fewer parameters. Implementations on embedded platforms, including Raspberry Pi
4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, show high frame rates ranging from 8 FPS up to 44.8
FPS. The proposed classifier exhibits up to 87.84x better FPS than the
state-of-the-art and significantly improves event-based vision performance,
making it ideal for low-power, high-speed applications in real-time edge
computing.

Result: 在多个视频推理基准测试中，Video-RTS仅用3.6%的训练样本，平均准确率提升2.4%。

Conclusion: Video-RTS通过纯强化学习和自适应视频缩放策略，实现了高效且高性能的视频推理。

Abstract: Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with
large language models (LLMs), data collection and finetuning remain significant
challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations,
making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a
new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved
data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time
scaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL
samples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL
training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or
extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more
efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves
inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate
our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS
surpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy
using only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2%
improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning
benchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU. Notably, our pure RL training and
adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong
reasoning performance.

Motivation: 当前姿态估计网络在2D特征提取上表现不佳，尤其是在目标被遮挡或场景杂乱时，RGB信息有限。

Method: 引入2D-3D对应图和可见掩码图作为额外模态信息，结合RGB图像进行基于重建的模型预训练，并设计目标聚焦的预训练损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有的端到端姿态估计方法。

Conclusion: Mask6D通过预训练策略有效提升了姿态估计的鲁棒性，尤其在复杂场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Robust 6D object pose estimation in cluttered or occluded conditions using
monocular RGB images remains a challenging task. One reason is that current
pose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware
features using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB
information is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate
this, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named
Mask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and
visible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB
images for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D
correspondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the
pose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the
integrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard
cluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training
loss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the
background interference. Finally, we fine-tune our pre-trained pose prior-aware
network via conventional pose training strategy to realize the reliable pose
prediction. Extensive experiments verify that our method outperforms previous
end-to-end pose estimation methods.

Method: 提出BC-HOI框架，包含ABG（生成细粒度实例级交互特征）和LSG（提供细粒度监督）。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: BC-HOI框架有效解决了开放词汇HOI检测中的细粒度特征问题。

Abstract: Open vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a challenging
task that detects all <human, verb, object> triplets of interest in an image,
even those that are not pre-defined in the training set. Existing approaches
typically rely on output features generated by large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to enhance the generalization ability of interaction representations.
However, the visual features produced by VLMs are holistic and coarse-grained,
which contradicts the nature of detection tasks. To address this issue, we
propose a novel Bilateral Collaboration framework for open vocabulary HOI
detection (BC-HOI). This framework includes an Attention Bias Guidance (ABG)
component, which guides the VLM to produce fine-grained instance-level
interaction features according to the attention bias provided by the HOI
detector. It also includes a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Supervision
Guidance (LSG) component, which provides fine-grained token-level supervision
for the HOI detector by the LLM component of the VLM. LSG enhances the ability
of ABG to generate high-quality attention bias. We conduct extensive
experiments on two popular benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO, consistently
achieving superior performance in the open vocabulary and closed settings. The
code will be released in Github.

analysis of 35 vision-driven tasks and comprehensive examinations and
visualizations of 73 available datasets based on the proposed taxonomy. The
cross-domain investigation covers the pros and cons of each benchmark with the
aim of providing information on standards unification and resource
optimization. Our article concludes with a systematic discussion of the
existing weaknesses, underlining the potential effects and promising solutions
from various perspectives. The integrated taxonomy, comprehensive analysis, and

### [61] [FIFA: Unified Faithfulness Evaluation Framework for Text-to-Video and Video-to-Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06523)
*Liqiang Jing,Viet Lai,Seunghyun Yoon,Trung Bui,Xinya Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIFA是一个统一的视频多模态大语言模型（VideoMLLMs）忠实性评估框架，通过提取描述性事实、建模语义依赖关系并验证，解决了现有评估方法在开放自由响应中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoMLLMs在视频到文本和文本到视频任务中表现优异，但存在幻觉问题，现有评估方法无法全面评估开放自由响应中的幻觉。

Method: 提出FIFA框架，包括提取描述性事实、构建时空语义依赖图并通过VideoQA模型验证，同时引入基于工具的后校正方法修正幻觉内容。

Result: 实验表明FIFA比现有评估方法更符合人类判断，后校正方法有效提升了文本和视频生成的事实一致性。

Conclusion: FIFA和后校正方法为VideoMLLMs的忠实性评估和幻觉修正提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (VideoMLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in both Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks. However, they often
suffer fro hallucinations, generating content that contradicts the visual
input. Existing evaluation methods are limited to one task (e.g., V2T) and also
fail to assess hallucinations in open-ended, free-form responses. To address
this gap, we propose FIFA, a unified FaIthFulness evAluation framework that
extracts comprehensive descriptive facts, models their semantic dependencies
via a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using
VideoQA models. We further introduce Post-Correction, a tool-based correction
framework that revises hallucinated content. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FIFA aligns more closely with human judgment than existing evaluation
methods, and that Post-Correction effectively improves factual consistency in
both text and video generation.

### [62] [Concept Unlearning by Modeling Key Steps of Diffusion Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06526)
*Chaoshuo Zhang,Chenhao Lin,Zhengyu Zhao,Le Yang,Qian Wang,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为KSCU的新方法，通过针对扩散模型的关键步骤进行概念遗忘，平衡了遗忘效果与生成能力的保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念遗忘方法难以平衡遗忘效果与生成能力，导致扩散模型的安全风险。

Method: KSCU方法利用扩散模型的逐步采样特性，专注于关键步骤进行微调，减少参数更新。

Result: 实验表明，KSCU能有效防止生成不良图像，同时保留模型的生成能力。

Conclusion: KSCU为扩散模型的安全使用提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs), represented by Stable Diffusion,
which generate highly realistic images based on textual input, have been widely
used. However, their misuse poses serious security risks. While existing
concept unlearning methods aim to mitigate these risks, they struggle to
balance unlearning effectiveness with generative retainability.To overcome this
limitation, we innovatively propose the Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU)
method, which ingeniously capitalizes on the unique stepwise sampling
characteristic inherent in diffusion models during the image generation
process. Unlike conventional approaches that treat all denoising steps equally,
KSCU strategically focuses on pivotal steps with the most influence over the
final outcome by dividing key steps for different concept unlearning tasks and
fine-tuning the model only at those steps. This targeted approach reduces the
number of parameter updates needed for effective unlearning, while maximizing
the retention of the model's generative capabilities.Through extensive
benchmark experiments, we demonstrate that KSCU effectively prevents T2I DMs
from generating undesirable images while better retaining the model's
generative capabilities.Our code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将英语语音转换为流畅的3D手语动画的完整流程，结合了语音识别、机器翻译和动作生成技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帮助聋哑人士更轻松地沟通，填补了从英语语音到手语动画转换的研究空白。

Method: 使用Whisper进行语音转文本，MarianMT模型将文本翻译为ASL gloss，结合Word2Vec和FastText优化翻译，并通过3D关键点动作系统生成动画。

Result: 系统表现优异，BLEU分数达到0.7714和0.8923，并创建了新的数据集Sign3D-WLASL和BookGlossCorpus-CG。

Conclusion: 该流程整合了音频、文本和动作，实现了从英语语音到逼真3D手语动画的完整转换。

Abstract: Helping deaf and hard-of-hearing people communicate more easily is the main
goal of Automatic Sign Language Translation. Although most past research has
focused on turning sign language into text, doing the reverse, turning spoken
English into sign language animations, has been largely overlooked. That's
because it involves multiple steps, such as understanding speech, translating
it into sign-friendly grammar, and generating natural human motion. In this
work, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into
smooth, realistic 3D sign language animations. Our system starts with Whisper
to translate spoken English into text. Then, we use a MarianMT machine
translation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL)
gloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without
grammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923.
To make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such
as Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the
translated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on
Sign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key
points from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset. To support the gloss
translation stage, we also built a new dataset called BookGlossCorpus-CG, which
turns everyday English sentences from the BookCorpus dataset into ASL gloss
using grammar rules. Our system stitches everything together by smoothly
interpolating between signs to create natural, continuous animations. Unlike
previous works like How2Sign and Phoenix-2014T that focus on recognition or use
only one type of data, our pipeline brings together audio, text, and motion in
a single framework that goes all the way from spoken English to lifelike 3D
sign language animation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ILNet，一种结合逆向学习注意力（IL Attention）和动态锚点选择（DAS）模块的多智能体轨迹预测方法，旨在提升复杂交互模式的捕捉能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在交互时空协调方面表现不足，且固定锚点选择策略难以适应不同未来环境。受人类驾驶行为的启发，论文提出动态调整初始决策的方法。

Method: ILNet采用逆向学习注意力模块动态编码交互时空协调，并引入可学习的DAS模块提取轨迹变化关键点作为锚点。

Result: 实验表明，ILNet在INTERACTION和Argoverse数据集上达到最优性能，尤其在复杂交互场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: ILNet通过动态建模交互意图和自适应锚点选择，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性和多模态分布能力。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for multi-agent interaction scenarios is a crucial
challenge. Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently
factorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static
and foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination,
capturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the
modern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a
fixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different
future environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust
initial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of
surrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes
ILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL)
attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an
inverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments,
introducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal
coordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture
complex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to
extract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost
no increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion
forecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet
achieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over
fewer parameters. Our codes are available at https://github.com/mjZeng11/ILNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野生动物数据标注和模型训练成本高，现有主动学习方法需要完全访问模型，限制了其应用。

Result: 在基准数据集上验证，使用30%的训练数据即可达到或超过完整数据集的检测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为野生动物监测和保护的自动化提供了高效的数据标注解决方案。

Abstract: Smart data selection is becoming increasingly important in data-driven
machine learning. Active learning offers a promising solution by allowing
machine learning models to be effectively trained with optimal data including
the most informative samples from large datasets. Wildlife data captured by
camera traps are excessive in volume, requiring tremendous effort in data
labelling and animal detection models training. Therefore, applying active
learning to optimise the amount of labelled data would be a great aid in
enabling automated wildlife monitoring and conservation. However, existing
active learning techniques require that a machine learning model (i.e., an
object detector) be fully accessible, limiting the applicability of the
techniques. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic active learning approach
for detection of animals captured by camera traps. Our approach integrates
uncertainty and diversity quantities of samples at both the object-based and
image-based levels into the active learning sample selection process. We
validate our approach in a benchmark animal dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that, using only 30% of the training data selected by our approach,
a state-of-the-art animal detector can achieve a performance of equal or
greater than that with the use of the complete training dataset.

TL;DR: ToBo是一种自监督学习框架，通过压缩场景为瓶颈令牌并预测后续场景，学习动态场景的紧凑表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景的紧凑表示对于视觉跟踪和机器人操作等任务至关重要。

Method: ToBo通过压缩步骤将参考场景编码为瓶颈令牌，在扩展步骤中利用少量目标补丁预测目标场景。

Result: ToBo在视频标签传播和机器人操作等任务中表现优于基线，并在真实环境中验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ToBo能够有效学习动态场景的表示，并具有可扩展性和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Deriving compact and temporally aware visual representations from dynamic
scenes is essential for successful execution of sequential scene understanding
tasks such as visual tracking and robotic manipulation. In this paper, we
introduce Token Bottleneck (ToBo), a simple yet intuitive self-supervised
learning pipeline that squeezes a scene into a bottleneck token and predicts
the subsequent scene using minimal patches as hints. The ToBo pipeline
facilitates the learning of sequential scene representations by conservatively
encoding the reference scene into a compact bottleneck token during the squeeze
step. In the expansion step, we guide the model to capture temporal dynamics by
predicting the target scene using the bottleneck token along with few target
patches as hints. This design encourages the vision backbone to embed temporal
dependencies, thereby enabling understanding of dynamic transitions across
scenes. Extensive experiments in diverse sequential tasks, including video
label propagation and robot manipulation in simulated environments demonstrate
the superiority of ToBo over baselines. Moreover, deploying our pre-trained
model on physical robots confirms its robustness and effectiveness in
real-world environments. We further validate the scalability of ToBo across
different model scales.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Concept-TRAK的新方法，用于解决扩散模型在图像生成中的版权和透明度问题，通过概念级归因分析提供更细粒度的贡献识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现优异，但其广泛使用引发了版权和透明度问题。现有方法无法识别对特定元素（如风格或对象）的贡献，因此需要更细粒度的归因方法。

Method: 提出了Concept-TRAK方法，通过两种创新实现概念级归因：(1) 基于扩散后验采样的训练损失函数；(2) 强调语义相关性的概念感知奖励函数。

Result: 在AbC基准测试中，Concept-TRAK显著优于现有方法，并通过案例研究展示了其在识别受保护内容、分析提示工程等方面的实用性。

Conclusion: Concept-TRAK为生成式AI的负责任开发和治理提供了可操作的见解，解决了版权和透明度问题。

Abstract: While diffusion models excel at image generation, their growing adoption
raises critical concerns around copyright issues and model transparency.
Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire
image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as
styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called
\emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key
innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion
posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a
concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate
Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior
methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected
and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional
learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable
insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注成对关系，未能建模多视图的联合结构，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 提出DSF，将多视图表示为分布并计算分布间的差异作为相似性度量。

Result: DSF在kNN分类和线性评估等任务中表现优异，且效率更高。

Conclusion: DSF无需温度超参数即可有效工作，且理论证明了其与余弦相似性的联系。

Abstract: Recent success in contrastive learning has sparked growing interest in more
effectively leveraging multiple augmented views of an instance. While prior
methods incorporate multiple views at the loss or feature level, they primarily
capture pairwise relationships and fail to model the joint structure across all
views. In this work, we propose a divergence-based similarity function (DSF)
that explicitly captures the joint structure by representing each set of
augmented views as a distribution and measuring similarity as the divergence
between distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSF consistently
improves performance across various tasks, including kNN classification and
linear evaluation, while also offering greater efficiency compared to other
multi-view methods. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between
DSF and cosine similarity, and show that, unlike cosine similarity, DSF
operates effectively without requiring a temperature hyperparameter.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的损失函数EBT，通过将像素分为边缘、边界和纹理三类，并分配不同的权重，改进了传统WBCE损失在边缘检测中的模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WBCE损失对所有非边缘像素一视同仁，忽略了边缘附近的结构差异，导致预测模糊。

Method: 提出EBT损失，将像素分为边缘、边界和纹理三类，并为每类分配不同的监督权重。

Result: 实验证明EBT损失在多个基准测试中表现优于WBCE，且对超参数变化鲁棒。

Conclusion: EBT损失易于部署且性能优越，为边缘检测提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Edge detection (ED) remains a fundamental task in computer vision, yet its
performance is often hindered by the ambiguous nature of non-edge pixels near
object boundaries. The widely adopted Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE) loss
treats all non-edge pixels uniformly, overlooking the structural nuances around
edges and often resulting in blurred predictions. In this paper, we propose the
Edge-Boundary-Texture (EBT) loss, a novel objective that explicitly divides
pixels into three categories, edge, boundary, and texture, and assigns each a
distinct supervisory weight. This tri-class formulation enables more structured
learning by guiding the model to focus on both edge precision and contextual
boundary localization. We theoretically show that the EBT loss generalizes the
WBCE loss, with the latter becoming a limit case. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the EBT loss both
quantitatively and perceptually. Furthermore, the consistent use of unified
hyperparameters across all models and datasets, along with robustness to their
moderate variations, indicates that the EBT loss requires minimal fine-tuning
and is easily deployable in practice.

TL;DR: MOST是一种通过时间片段Banzhaf交互的新型运动扩散模型，旨在解决从罕见语言提示生成人类运动的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因粗粒度匹配和忽视语义线索而难以生成高质量运动，MOST通过利用细粒度片段关系来解决这些问题。

Method: MOST采用时间片段Banzhaf交互量化文本-运动一致性，并通过运动提示模块生成语义一致的运动。

Result: MOST在文本到运动的检索和生成任务中达到最先进水平，尤其在罕见提示下表现突出。

Conclusion: MOST通过细粒度片段交互和生成模块，显著提升了文本到运动任务的性能。

Abstract: We introduce MOST, a novel motion diffusion model via temporal clip Banzhaf
interaction, aimed at addressing the persistent challenge of generating human
motion from rare language prompts. While previous approaches struggle with
coarse-grained matching and overlook important semantic cues due to motion
redundancy, our key insight lies in leveraging fine-grained clip relationships
to mitigate these issues. MOST's retrieval stage presents the first formulation
of its kind - temporal clip Banzhaf interaction - which precisely quantifies
textual-motion coherence at the clip level. This facilitates direct,
fine-grained text-to-motion clip matching and eliminates prevalent redundancy.
In the generation stage, a motion prompt module effectively utilizes retrieved
motion clips to produce semantically consistent movements. Extensive
evaluations confirm that MOST achieves state-of-the-art text-to-motion
retrieval and generation performance by comprehensively addressing previous
challenges, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative results
highlighting its effectiveness, especially for rare prompts.

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性，提升了分割性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过自适应模糊度估计和对比学习，显著提升了3D语义分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive margin contrastive learning method for 3D
semantic segmentation on point clouds. Most existing methods use equally
penalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less
discriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly
ambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually
annotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points
would lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design
AMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity
estimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points
based on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,
which ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes
for high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position
discrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by
the assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking
ambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further
propose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where
a novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from
generated embeddings. To this end, we design a masked refinement mechanism that
leverages predicted ambiguities to enable the ambiguous embeddings to be more
reliable, thereby boosting segmentation performance and enhancing robustness.
Experimental results on 3D indoor scene datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet,
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HDR视频重建中，交替曝光方法导致的曝光波动常引发闪烁问题，需要一种更稳定的解决方案。

Method: 使用双摄像头系统（DCS）分别捕获参考和非参考序列，并设计EAFNet网络进行特征对齐、融合和重建。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同数据集上达到了最先进的性能，验证了DCS在HDR视频重建中的潜力。

Conclusion: 提出的DCS和EAFNet有效解决了HDR视频中的闪烁问题，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: In HDR video reconstruction, exposure fluctuations in reference images from
alternating exposure methods often result in flickering. To address this issue,
we propose a dual-camera system (DCS) for HDR video acquisition, where one
camera is assigned to capture consistent reference sequences, while the other
is assigned to capture non-reference sequences for information supplementation.
To tackle the challenges posed by video data, we introduce an exposure-adaptive
fusion network (EAFNet) to achieve more robust results. EAFNet introduced a
pre-alignment subnetwork to explore the influence of exposure, selectively
emphasizing the valuable features across different exposure levels. Then, the
enhanced features are fused by the asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork,
which explores reference-dominated attention maps to improve image fusion by
aligning cross-scale features and performing cross-feature fusion. Finally, the
reconstruction subnetwork adopts a DWT-based multiscale architecture to reduce
ghosting artifacts and refine features at different resolutions. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, validating the great
potential of the DCS in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured
by DCS will be available at https://github.com/zqqqyu/DCS.

Motivation: 长期动作识别（LTAR）因时间跨度长、动作关联复杂及视觉干扰而具有挑战性。现有方法多依赖统计相关性而非因果机制，且缺乏跨模态因果建模。

Result: 在Charades、Breakfast和COIN三个基准测试中验证了CMDCL的有效性。

Conclusion: CMDCL通过双因果干预实现了鲁棒的动作表示，为长期动作识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Long-term action recognition (LTAR) is challenging due to extended temporal
spans with complex atomic action correlations and visual confounders. Although
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise, they often rely on
statistical correlations instead of causal mechanisms. Moreover, existing
causality-based methods address modal-specific biases but lack cross-modal
causal modeling, limiting their utility in VLM-based LTAR. This paper proposes
\textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{C}ausal \textbf{L}earning
(CMDCL), which introduces a structural causal model to uncover causal
relationships between videos and label texts.
  CMDCL addresses cross-modal biases in text embeddings via textual causal
intervention and removes confounders inherent in the visual modality through
visual causal intervention guided by the debiased text.
  These dual-causal interventions enable robust action representations to
address LTAR challenges. Experimental results on three benchmarks including
Charades, Breakfast and COIN, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
model. Our code is available at https://github.com/xushaowu/CMDCL.

Motivation: 医学高光谱成像（MHSI）在疾病诊断中具有潜力，但高维度和光谱冗余特性使其信息融合具有挑战性。

Method: 设计了跨维度特征融合操作，包括双向注意力机制、光谱引导的空间查询选择和两阶段跨维度解码器。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在DSC指标上比现有方法提升了5.73%。

Conclusion: Omni-Fuse通过高效的特征融合显著提升了医学高光谱图像的分割性能。

Abstract: Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) has emerged as a promising tool for
enhanced disease diagnosis, particularly in computational pathology, offering
rich spectral information that aids in identifying subtle biochemical
properties of tissues. Despite these advantages, effectively fusing both
spatial-dimensional and spectral-dimensional information from MHSIs remains
challenging due to its high dimensionality and spectral redundancy inherent
characteristics. To solve the above challenges, we propose a novel
spatial-spectral omni-fusion network for hyperspectral image segmentation,
named as Omni-Fuse. Here, we introduce abundant cross-dimensional feature
fusion operations, including a cross-dimensional enhancement module that
refines both spatial and spectral features through bidirectional attention
mechanisms, a spectral-guided spatial query selection to select the most
spectral-related spatial feature as the query, and a two-stage
cross-dimensional decoder which dynamically guide the model to focus on the
selected spatial query. Despite of numerous attention blocks, Omni-Fuse remains
efficient in execution. Experiments on two microscopic hyperspectral image
datasets show that our approach can significantly improve the segmentation
performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, with over 5.73 percent
improvement in DSC. Code available at:

Motivation: 现有基于投影的方法因视角独立性导致投影多样性不足，且多投影冗余带来计算开销大。

Method: 设计了VDP框架，通过数据驱动生成投影，结合颜色正则化优化投影图像。

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet基准测试中表现优异，计算成本低。

Conclusion: PointVDP为点云语义理解提供了一种资源高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose view-dependent projection (VDP) to facilitate point
cloud segmentation, designing efficient 3D-to-2D mapping that dynamically
adapts to the spatial geometry from view variations. Existing projection-based
methods leverage view-independent projection in complex scenes, relying on
straight lines to generate direct rays or upward curves to reduce occlusions.
However, their view independence provides projection rays that are limited to
pre-defined parameters by human settings, restricting point awareness and
failing to capture sufficient projection diversity across different view
planes. Although multiple projections per view plane are commonly used to
enhance spatial variety, the projected redundancy leads to excessive
computational overhead and inefficiency in image processing. To address these
limitations, we design a framework of VDP to generate data-driven projections
from 3D point distributions, producing highly informative single-image inputs
by predicting rays inspired by the adaptive behavior of fireworks. In addition,
we construct color regularization to optimize the framework, which emphasizes
essential features within semantic pixels and suppresses the non-semantic
features within black pixels, thereby maximizing 2D space utilization in a
projected image. As a result, our approach, PointVDP, develops lightweight
projections in marginal computation costs. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet
benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive results, offering a
resource-efficient solution for semantic understanding.

Conclusion: EXAONE Path 2.0通过切片级监督学习，显著提升了数据效率和性能，为数字病理学提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle
due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via
self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings
via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks.
However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are
essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular
characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for
natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain
less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive
computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To
address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation
model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level
supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves
state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks,
demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.

Motivation: 医学领域中，密集标注成本高且不现实，尤其是新任务。稀疏标注的学习能力可以推动研究进展，但现有方法利用不足。

Result: 通过大量消融实验，证明了该方法在癌变关键点密集定位中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在密集标注难以获取的场景中具有潜力，可推动相关研究。

Abstract: Learning from sparse labels is a challenge commonplace in the medical domain.
This is due to numerous factors, such as annotation cost, and is especially
true for newly introduced tasks. When dense pixel-level annotations are needed,
this becomes even more unfeasible. However, being able to learn from just a few
annotations at the pixel-level, while extremely difficult and underutilized,
can drive progress in studies where perfect annotations are not immediately
available. This work tackles the challenge of learning the dense prediction
task of keypoint localization from a few point annotations in the context of 2d
carcinosis keypoint localization from laparoscopic video frames for diagnostic
planning of advanced ovarian cancer patients. To enable this, we formulate the
problem as a sparse heatmap regression from a few point annotations per image
and propose a new loss function, called Crag and Tail loss, for efficient
learning. Our proposed loss function effectively leverages positive sparse
labels while minimizing the impact of false negatives or missed annotations.
Through an extensive ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in achieving accurate dense localization of carcinosis keypoints,
highlighting its potential to advance research in scenarios where dense
annotations are challenging to obtain.

Conclusion: ClipGS在渲染质量和效率上均优于现有技术，适用于医学数据的交互式可视化。

Abstract: The visualization of volumetric medical data is crucial for enhancing
diagnostic accuracy and improving surgical planning and education. Cinematic
rendering techniques significantly enrich this process by providing
high-quality visualizations that convey intricate anatomical details, thereby
facilitating better understanding and decision-making in medical contexts.
However, the high computing cost and low rendering speed limit the requirement
of interactive visualization in practical applications. In this paper, we
introduce ClipGS, an innovative Gaussian splatting framework with the clipping
plane supported, for interactive cinematic visualization of volumetric medical
data. To address the challenges posed by dynamic interactions, we propose a
learnable truncation scheme that automatically adjusts the visibility of
Gaussian primitives in response to the clipping plane. Besides, we also design
an adaptive adjustment model to dynamically adjust the deformation of Gaussians
and refine the rendering performance. We validate our method on five volumetric
medical data (including CT and anatomical slice data), and reach an average
36.635 PSNR rendering quality with 156 FPS and 16.1 MB model size,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and efficiency.

TL;DR: Diff$^2$I2P提出了一种基于扩散模型的图像到点云（I2P）配准框架，通过Control-Side Score Distillation（CSD）和Deformable Correspondence Tuning（DCT）模块，有效解决了跨模态特征对齐问题，显著提升了配准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过度量学习实现跨模态特征对齐，但忽略了图像与点云数据的固有模态差异，导致跨模态对应关系不准确。

Method: 提出Diff$^2$I2P框架，利用扩散模型作为先验，结合CSD技术优化变换预测，并通过DCT模块实现可微的对应关系估计和PnP求解。

Result: 在7-Scenes基准测试中，Diff$^2$I2P显著优于现有方法，配准召回率提升超过7%。

Conclusion: Diff$^2$I2P通过扩散模型和可微设计，成功解决了跨模态配准中的特征对齐问题，为I2P配准提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning cross-modal correspondences is essential for image-to-point cloud
(I2P) registration. Existing methods achieve this mostly by utilizing metric
learning to enforce feature alignment across modalities, disregarding the
inherent modality gap between image and point data. Consequently, this paradigm
struggles to ensure accurate cross-modal correspondences. To this end, inspired
by the cross-modal generation success of recent large diffusion models, we
propose Diff$^2$I2P, a fully Differentiable I2P registration framework,
leveraging a novel and effective Diffusion prior for bridging the modality gap.
Specifically, we propose a Control-Side Score Distillation (CSD) technique to
distill knowledge from a depth-conditioned diffusion model to directly optimize
the predicted transformation. However, the gradients on the transformation fail
to backpropagate onto the cross-modal features due to the non-differentiability
of correspondence retrieval and PnP solver. To this end, we further propose a
Deformable Correspondence Tuning (DCT) module to estimate the correspondences
in a differentiable way, followed by the transformation estimation using a
differentiable PnP solver. With these two designs, the Diffusion model serves
as a strong prior to guide the cross-modal feature learning of image and point
cloud for forming robust correspondences, which significantly improves the
registration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Diff$^2$I2P
consistently outperforms SoTA I2P registration methods, achieving over 7%
improvement in registration recall on the 7-Scenes benchmark.

Motivation: 传统方法仅关注图像外观的多样性指标，但其期望值因应用而异，限制了结果多样化（RD）的应用范围。

Method: 提出Multi-Source DPPs，扩展了Determinantal Point Process（DPP）到多源场景，并引入Tangent Normalization以反映上下文。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效。

Conclusion: CDR-CA任务和Multi-Source DPPs方法为结果多样化提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Result diversification (RD) is a crucial technique in Text-to-Image Retrieval
for enhancing the efficiency of a practical application. Conventional methods
focus solely on increasing the diversity metric of image appearances. However,
the diversity metric and its desired value vary depending on the application,
which limits the applications of RD. This paper proposes a novel task called
CDR-CA (Contextual Diversity Refinement of Composite Attributes). CDR-CA aims
to refine the diversities of multiple attributes, according to the
application's context. To address this task, we propose Multi-Source DPPs, a
simple yet strong baseline that extends the Determinantal Point Process (DPP)
to multi-sources. We model MS-DPP as a single DPP model with a unified
similarity matrix based on a manifold representation. We also introduce Tangent
Normalization to reflect contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is publicly available at

Result: 实验表明，SPGD在多种恢复任务中显著提升了生成稳定性，取得了定量和视觉上的最佳性能。

Conclusion: SPGD通过梯度管理技术有效解决了扩散模型中的不稳定性问题，为图像恢复提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by
leveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration
problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a
denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions
between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In
this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and
identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts
between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal
fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these
instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration
performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive
Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD
integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up
strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum
(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive
experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD
significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results. Code is

Conclusion: MK-Pose通过多模态融合和图关系建模，显著提升了类别级物体姿态估计的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation, which predicts the pose of objects
within a known category without prior knowledge of individual instances, is
essential in applications like warehouse automation and manufacturing. Existing
methods relying on RGB images or point cloud data often struggle with object
occlusion and generalization across different instances and categories. This
paper proposes a multimodal-based keypoint learning framework (MK-Pose) that
integrates RGB images, point clouds, and category-level textual descriptions.
The model uses a self-supervised keypoint detection module enhanced with
attention-based query generation, soft heatmap matching and graph-based
relational modeling. Additionally, a graph-enhanced feature fusion module is
designed to integrate local geometric information and global context. MK-Pose
is evaluated on CAMERA25 and REAL275 dataset, and is further tested for
cross-dataset capability on HouseCat6D dataset. The results demonstrate that
MK-Pose outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both IoU and average
precision without shape priors. Codes will be released at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩方法需要大量重新训练或微调，缺乏灵活性，难以适应不同压缩需求。

Method: 采用混合精度量化和属性判别剪枝，无需重新训练。

Result: 压缩率高达96.4%，渲染质量损失小（PSNR下降<1 dB），速度快于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlexGaussian是一种灵活、高效的3D高斯压缩方法，适用于移动设备。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has become a prominent technique for representing and
rendering complex 3D scenes, due to its high fidelity and speed advantages.
However, the growing demand for large-scale models calls for effective
compression to reduce memory and computation costs, especially on mobile and
edge devices with limited resources. Existing compression methods effectively
reduce 3D Gaussian parameters but often require extensive retraining or
fine-tuning, lacking flexibility under varying compression constraints.
  In this paper, we introduce FlexGaussian, a flexible and cost-effective
method that combines mixed-precision quantization with attribute-discriminative
pruning for training-free 3D Gaussian compression. FlexGaussian eliminates the
need for retraining and adapts easily to diverse compression targets.
Evaluation results show that FlexGaussian achieves up to 96.4% compression
while maintaining high rendering quality (<1 dB drop in PSNR), and is
deployable on mobile devices. FlexGaussian delivers high compression ratios
within seconds, being 1.7-2.1x faster than state-of-the-art training-free
methods and 10-100x faster than training-involved approaches. The code is being
prepared and will be released soon at:

Conclusion: QUANet通过增强数量感知和优化多流知识融合，显著提升了计数任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
progress in solving the text-promptable object counting problem. Representative
methods typically specify text prompts with object category information in
images. This however is insufficient for training the model to accurately
distinguish the number of objects in the counting task. To this end, we propose
QUANet, which introduces novel quantity-oriented text prompts with a
vision-text quantity alignment loss to enhance the model's quantity awareness.
Moreover, we propose a dual-stream adaptive counting decoder consisting of a
Transformer stream, a CNN stream, and a number of Transformer-to-CNN
enhancement adapters (T2C-adapters) for density map prediction. The
T2C-adapters facilitate the effective knowledge communication and aggregation
between the Transformer and CNN streams. A cross-stream quantity ranking loss
is proposed in the end to optimize the ranking orders of predictions from the
two streams. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks such as FSC-147,
CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech demonstrate our model's strong generalizability
for zero-shot class-agnostic counting. Code is available at

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner通过结合LLM和视觉属性，有效提升了开放词汇3D视觉定位的准确性和空间推理能力。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on
free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such
as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language
fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D
scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target
objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods
struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language
queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from
inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D
scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural
representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial
reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature
field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in
language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial
relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial
relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner
incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical
feature field. This field represents language and instance features using
distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a
hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial
relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework
can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations,
outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their
spatial reasoning capability.

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了BLEU-4和ROUGE分数，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: 分层预训练策略有效提升了手语翻译性能，为无注释方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) attempts to convert sign language videos into
spoken sentences. However, many existing methods struggle with the disparity
between visual and textual representations during end-to-end learning.
Gloss-based approaches help to bridge this gap by leveraging structured
linguistic information. While, gloss-free methods offer greater flexibility and
remove the burden of annotation, they require effective alignment strategies.
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled gloss-free SLT by
generating text-like representations from sign videos. In this work, we
introduce a novel hierarchical pre-training strategy inspired by the structure
of sign language, incorporating pseudo-glosses and contrastive video-language
alignment. Our method hierarchically extracts features at frame, segment, and
video levels, aligning them with pseudo-glosses and the spoken sentence to
enhance translation quality. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves
BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection (AD) is challenging due to diverse imaging
modalities, anatomical variations, and limited labeled data. We propose a novel
approach combining visual adapters and prompt learning with Partial Optimal
Transport (POT) and contrastive learning (CL) to improve CLIP's adaptability to
medical images, particularly for AD. Unlike standard prompt learning, which
often yields a single representation, our method employs multiple prompts

enforces intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation. Our method achieves

Conclusion: RPFNet通过频域建模和残差先验，显著提升了图像融合效果和计算效率。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information across modalities to
generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing the performance of
high-level vision tasks. While global spatial modeling mechanisms show
promising results, constructing long-range feature dependencies in the spatial
domain incurs substantial computational costs. Additionally, the absence of
ground-truth exacerbates the difficulty of capturing complementary features
effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Residual Prior-driven
Frequency-aware Network, termed as RPFNet. Specifically, RPFNet employs a
dual-branch feature extraction framework: the Residual Prior Module (RPM)
extracts modality-specific difference information from residual maps, thereby
providing complementary priors for fusion; the Frequency Domain Fusion Module
(FDFM) achieves efficient global feature modeling and integration through
frequency-domain convolution. Additionally, the Cross Promotion Module (CPM)
enhances the synergistic perception of local details and global structures
through bidirectional feature interaction. During training, we incorporate an
auxiliary decoder and saliency structure loss to strengthen the model's
sensitivity to modality-specific differences. Furthermore, a combination of
adaptive weight-based frequency contrastive loss and SSIM loss effectively
constrains the solution space, facilitating the joint capture of local details
and global features while ensuring the retention of complementary information.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个半导体晶圆切割过程的公开数据集CHDL，并设计了双路径预测模型DIFFUMA，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高精度工业场景（如半导体制造）缺乏专用数据集，阻碍了复杂过程建模与预测的研究。

Method: 构建CHDL数据集，并提出DIFFUMA模型，结合Mamba模块和扩散模块，分别处理全局时序和局部空间细节。

Result: DIFFUMA在CHDL上表现优异，MSE降低39%，SSIM提升至0.988，且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了SOTA模型，还为工业AI领域贡献了宝贵的数据资源。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video prediction plays a pivotal role in critical domains,
ranging from weather forecasting to industrial automation. However, in
high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the
absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling
and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold
contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset
(CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor
wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL
provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process
modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose
DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed
for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal
context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a
diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance
fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation.
Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly
outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and
improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988.
This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our
work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more
importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive
future research in industrial AI.

*Zishen Huang,Chunyu Yang,Mengyuan Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于提示复杂度的自适应缓存方法（PCA缓存），通过动态调整重用阈值和优化输入输出建模，显著提升了视频生成的推理速度，同时保持高质量输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成中固定频率的缓存机制在复杂场景下质量下降明显，且手动调参效率低、缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 提出PCA缓存，利用输入提示的语义信息动态调整重用阈值；改进TeaCache的输入输出建模；引入动态CFGCache机制。

Result: 实验表明，方法在Wan2.1模型上实现了2.79倍加速，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: PCA缓存和动态CFGCache结合显著提升了视频生成的效率和适应性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major
bottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via
caching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such
fixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while
manually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To
address this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that
automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated
directly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues,
PCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional
caching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a
key limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to
an oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance
the contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's
predictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To
further reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with
DynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free
guidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for
more flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example,
2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across
a range of scenes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种局部和全局双粒度身份关联机制，通过跨模态身份关系和动态调整机制提升文本到人物图像匹配的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理复杂的一对多身份关系，限制了性能提升。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提高了跨模态匹配的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为文本到人物图像匹配提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly supervised text-to-person image matching, as a crucial approach to
reducing models' reliance on large-scale manually labeled samples, holds
significant research value. However, existing methods struggle to predict
complex one-to-many identity relationships, severely limiting performance
improvements. To address this challenge, we propose a local-and-global
dual-granularity identity association mechanism. Specifically, at the local
level, we explicitly establish cross-modal identity relationships within a
batch, reinforcing identity constraints across different modalities and
enabling the model to better capture subtle differences and correlations. At
the global level, we construct a dynamic cross-modal identity association
network with the visual modality as the anchor and introduce a confidence-based
dynamic adjustment mechanism, effectively enhancing the model's ability to
identify weakly associated samples while improving overall sensitivity.
Additionally, we propose an information-asymmetric sample pair construction
method combined with consistency learning to tackle hard sample mining and
enhance model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method substantially boosts cross-modal matching accuracy, providing an
efficient and practical solution for text-to-person image matching.

Conclusion: 该研究为濒危语言OCR提供了可迁移的框架，降低了技术和财务门槛，使历史学家和语言学家无需专业计算资源即可处理历史档案。

Abstract: Manchu, a critically endangered language essential for understanding early
modern Eastern Eurasian history, lacks effective OCR systems that can handle
real-world historical documents. This study develops high-performing OCR
systems by fine-tuning three open-source vision-language models (LLaMA-3.2-11B,
Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on 60,000 synthetic Manchu word images using
parameter-efficient training. LLaMA-3.2-11B achieved exceptional performance
with 98.3\% word accuracy and 0.0024 character error rate on synthetic data,
while crucially maintaining 93.1\% accuracy on real-world handwritten
documents. Comparative evaluation reveals substantial advantages over
traditional approaches: while a CRNN baseline achieved 99.8\% synthetic
accuracy, it suffered severe degradation to 72.5\% on real documents. Our
approach demonstrates effective synthetic-to-real domain transfer, providing a
cost-effective solution deployable on accessible infrastructure. This work
establishes a transferable framework for endangered language OCR that removes
technical and financial barriers in digital humanities, enabling historians and
linguists to process historical archives without specialized computing

Result: 在矢状面准确率达92.44%，优于其他方法，且在多视角中表现稳健。

Conclusion: FOLC-Net为分散式医疗图像分析提供了更可靠、适应性更强的解决方案。

Abstract: The framework is designed to improve performance in the analysis of combined
as well as single anatomical perspectives for MRI disease diagnosis. It
specifically addresses the performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models, particularly when processing axial, coronal, and sagittal
anatomical planes. The paper introduces the FOLC-Net framework, which
incorporates a novel federated-optimized lightweight architecture with
approximately 1.217 million parameters and a storage requirement of only 0.9
MB. FOLC-Net integrates Manta-ray foraging optimization (MRFO) mechanisms for
efficient model structure generation, global model cloning for scalable
training, and ConvNeXt for enhanced client adaptability. The model was
evaluated on combined multi-view data as well as individual views, such as
axial, coronal, and sagittal, to assess its robustness in various medical
imaging scenarios. Moreover, FOLC-Net tests a ShallowFed model on different
data to evaluate its ability to generalize beyond the training dataset. The
results show that FOLC-Net outperforms existing models, particularly in the
challenging sagittal view. For instance, FOLC-Net achieved an accuracy of
92.44% on the sagittal view, significantly higher than the 88.37% accuracy of
study method (DL + Residual Learning) and 88.95% of DL models. Additionally,
FOLC-Net demonstrated improved accuracy across all individual views, providing
a more reliable and robust solution for medical image analysis in decentralized
environments. FOLC-Net addresses the limitations of existing SOTA models by
providing a framework that ensures better adaptability to individual views
while maintaining strong performance in multi-view settings. The incorporation
of MRFO, global model cloning, and ConvNeXt ensures that FOLC-Net performs
better in real-world medical applications.

Abstract: Thermal imaging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) holds significant
potential for applications in search and rescue, wildlife monitoring, and
emergency response, especially under low-light or obscured conditions. However,
the scarcity of large-scale, diverse thermal aerial datasets limits the
advancement of deep learning models in this domain, primarily due to the high
cost and logistical challenges of collecting thermal data. In this work, we
introduce a novel procedural pipeline for generating synthetic thermal images
from an aerial perspective. Our method integrates arbitrary object classes into
existing thermal backgrounds by providing control over the position, scale, and
orientation of the new objects, while aligning them with the viewpoints of the
background. We enhance existing thermal datasets by introducing new object
categories, specifically adding a drone class in urban environments to the
HIT-UAV dataset and an animal category to the MONET dataset. In evaluating
these datasets for object detection task, we showcase strong performance across
both new and existing classes, validating the successful expansion into new
applications. Through comparative analysis, we show that thermal detectors
outperform their visible-light-trained counterparts and highlight the
importance of replicating aerial viewing angles. Project page:

Abstract: Plant traits such as leaf carbon content and leaf mass are essential
variables in the study of biodiversity and climate change. However,
conventional field sampling cannot feasibly cover trait variation at
ecologically meaningful spatial scales. Machine learning represents a valuable
solution for plant trait prediction across ecosystems, leveraging hyperspectral
data from remote sensing. Nevertheless, trait prediction from hyperspectral
data is challenged by label scarcity and substantial domain shifts (\eg across
sensors, ecological distributions), requiring robust cross-domain methods.
Here, we present GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset encompassing
real-world cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples designed to benchmark trait
prediction with semi- and self-supervised methods. We adopt an evaluation
framework encompassing in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We
successfully leverage GreenHyperSpectra to pretrain label-efficient
multi-output regression models that outperform the state-of-the-art supervised
baseline. Our empirical analyses demonstrate substantial improvements in
learning spectral representations for trait prediction, establishing a
comprehensive methodological framework to catalyze research at the intersection
of representation learning and plant functional traits assessment. All code and

Result: D2I在领域内和领域外基准测试中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: D2I展示了规则奖励在多模态语言模型中的重要性，为训练和测试阶段的推理能力解耦提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reasoning is a key capability for large language models (LLMs), particularly
when applied to complex tasks such as mathematical problem solving. However,
multimodal reasoning research still requires further exploration of modality
alignment and training costs. Many of these approaches rely on additional data
annotation and relevant rule-based rewards to enhance the understanding and
reasoning ability, which significantly increases training costs and limits
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose the
Deliberate-to-Intuitive reasoning framework (D2I) that improves the
understanding and reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) without extra
annotations and complex rewards. Specifically, our method sets deliberate
reasoning strategies to enhance modality alignment only through the rule-based
format reward during training. While evaluating, the reasoning style shifts to
intuitive, which removes deliberate reasoning strategies during training and
implicitly reflects the model's acquired abilities in the response. D2I
outperforms baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Our
findings highlight the role of format reward in fostering transferable
reasoning skills in MLLMs, and inspire directions for decoupling training-time
reasoning depth from test-time response flexibility.

Abstract: Co-speech gesture video generation aims to synthesize realistic,
audio-aligned videos of speakers, complete with synchronized facial expressions
and body gestures. This task presents challenges due to the significant
one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by
the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We
propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an
efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our
approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio
segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image,
predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure
strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons
are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the
speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize
research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of
high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and
diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while
generalizing across speakers and contexts.

Method: 提出HVI颜色空间和HVI-CIDNet+网络，利用预训练视觉语言模型提取上下文知识，并通过Prior-guided Attention Block和Region Refinement Block优化内容恢复和颜色校正。

Result: 在10个基准数据集上，HVI-CIDNet+优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: HVI颜色空间和HVI-CIDNet+网络有效解决了低光图像增强中的颜色偏差和噪声问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) aims to restore vivid content and details
from corrupted low-light images. However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color
space-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due
to the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV)
color space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red
and black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color
space for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV
color map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances
for the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable
intensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.
Additionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+
(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and
mitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+
leverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light
images using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel
Prior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can
promote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color
correction, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the
meticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we
construct a Region Refinement Block that employs convolution for
information-rich regions and self-attention for information-scarce regions,
ensuring accurate brightness adjustments. Comprehensive results from benchmark
experiments demonstrate that the proposed HVI-CIDNet+ outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models
have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack
accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object
motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned
statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical
laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates
symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for
physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories
from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance
symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically
accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation
without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in
Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions,
our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves
the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging problem that
has been extensively studied in recent years. Traditional approaches often rely
on external modules like Class Activation Maps to highlight regions of interest
and generate pseudo segmentation masks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end
method that directly utilizes the attention maps learned by a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for WSSS. We propose training a sparse ViT with multiple
[CLS] tokens (one for each class), using a random masking strategy to promote
[CLS] token - class assignment. At inference time, we aggregate the different
self-attention maps of each [CLS] token corresponding to the predicted labels
to generate pseudo segmentation masks. Our proposed approach enhances the
interpretability of self-attention maps and ensures accurate class assignments.
Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks and three specialized datasets
demonstrate that our method generates accurate pseudo-masks, outperforming
related works. Those pseudo-masks can be used to train a segmentation model
which achieves results comparable to fully-supervised models, significantly
reducing the need for fine-grained labeled data.

Conclusion: IAP不仅对人类高度隐蔽，还能有效规避多种先进补丁防御系统。

Abstract: Despite modifying only a small localized input region, adversarial patches
can drastically change the prediction of computer vision models. However, prior
methods either cannot perform satisfactorily under targeted attack scenarios or
fail to produce contextually coherent adversarial patches, causing them to be
easily noticeable by human examiners and insufficiently stealthy against
automatic patch defenses. In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack
framework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on
perceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes.
Specifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by
leveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the
susceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human
visual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a
gradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible
perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and
model architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive
attack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch
invisibility compared to existing baselines. In addition to being highly
imperceptible to humans, IAP is shown to be stealthy enough to render several
state-of-the-art patch defenses ineffective.

Result: 实验表明，SemRaFiner在雷达泛光分割任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SemRaFiner通过优化特征提取和训练过程，显著提升了雷达数据的场景理解能力。

Abstract: Semantic scene understanding, including the perception and classification of
moving agents, is essential to enabling safe and robust driving behaviours of
autonomous vehicles. Cameras and LiDARs are commonly used for semantic scene
understanding. However, both sensor modalities face limitations in adverse
weather and usually do not provide motion information. Radar sensors overcome
these limitations and directly offer information about moving agents by
measuring the Doppler velocity, but the measurements are comparably sparse and
noisy. In this paper, we address the problem of panoptic segmentation in sparse
radar point clouds to enhance scene understanding. Our approach, called
SemRaFiner, accounts for changing density in sparse radar point clouds and
optimizes the feature extraction to improve accuracy. Furthermore, we propose
an optimized training procedure to refine instance assignments by incorporating
a dedicated data augmentation. Our experiments suggest that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for radar-based panoptic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有GCD方法依赖DINO的全局表示，导致区分性和泛化性之间存在固有权衡。APL旨在通过自适应部分发现和学习解决这一问题。

Method: APL利用共享可学习部分查询和DINO部分先验生成一致的对象部分及其对应关系，提出all-min对比损失学习区分性强且泛化性好的部分表示。

Result: APL显著提升了GCD框架在细粒度数据集上的性能。

Conclusion: APL通过自适应部分发现和学习，有效解决了GCD中区分性与泛化性的权衡问题，且无需额外标注。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to recognize unlabeled images from
known and novel classes by distinguishing novel classes from known ones, while
also transferring knowledge from another set of labeled images with known
classes. Existing GCD methods rely on self-supervised vision transformers such
as DINO for representation learning. However, focusing solely on the global
representation of the DINO CLS token introduces an inherent trade-off between
discriminability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive
part discovery and learning method, called APL, which generates consistent
object parts and their correspondences across different similar images using a
set of shared learnable part queries and DINO part priors, without requiring
any additional annotations. More importantly, we propose a novel all-min
contrastive loss to learn discriminative yet generalizable part representation,
which adaptively highlights discriminative object parts to distinguish similar
categories for enhanced discriminability while simultaneously sharing other
parts to facilitate knowledge transfer for improved generalization. Our APL can
easily be incorporated into different GCD frameworks by replacing their CLS
token feature with our part representations, showing significant enhancements
on fine-grained datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多属性中国书法字符数据集（MCCD），填补了现有书法数据集稀缺且缺乏属性标注的空白，为书法字符识别、书法家鉴定等研究提供了丰富资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究书法字符的属性信息（如风格、朝代、书法家）具有重要文化和历史价值，但现有数据集稀缺且缺乏多属性标注，限制了深入研究。

Method: 构建了包含7,765类共329,715个书法字符图像的MCCD数据集，并基于脚本风格、朝代和书法家属性提取了三个子集。

Result: 实验表明，书法字符的笔画结构复杂性和属性间的交互作用显著增加了识别的难度。

Conclusion: MCCD填补了详细书法数据集的空白，为书法研究和多领域发展提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Research on the attribute information of calligraphy, such as styles,
dynasties, and calligraphers, holds significant cultural and historical value.
However, the styles of Chinese calligraphy characters have evolved dramatically
through different dynasties and the unique touches of calligraphers, making it
highly challenging to accurately recognize these different characters and their
attributes. Furthermore, existing calligraphic datasets are extremely scarce,
and most provide only character-level annotations without additional attribute
information. This limitation has significantly hindered the in-depth study of
Chinese calligraphy. To fill this gap, we present a novel Multi-Attribute
Chinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD). The dataset encompasses 7,765
categories with a total of 329,715 isolated image samples of Chinese
calligraphy characters, and three additional subsets were extracted based on
the attribute labeling of the three types of script styles (10 types),
dynasties (15 periods) and calligraphers (142 individuals). The rich
multi-attribute annotations render MCCD well-suited diverse research tasks,
including calligraphic character recognition, writer identification, and
evolutionary studies of Chinese characters. We establish benchmark performance
through single-task and multi-task recognition experiments across MCCD and all
of its subsets. The experimental results demonstrate that the complexity of the
stroke structure of the calligraphic characters, and the interplay between
their different attributes, leading to a substantial increase in the difficulty
of accurate recognition. MCCD not only fills a void in the availability of
detailed calligraphy datasets but also provides valuable resources for
advancing research in Chinese calligraphy and fostering advancements in
multiple fields. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 研究古代人类对尼奥特罗皮克森林的长期管理影响，特别是在高分辨率尺度上。

Method: 结合深度学习模型（识别棕榈树）和聚类算法（识别棕榈集群），通过卫星图像分析估计古代管理区域。

Result: 棕榈树在考古遗址附近显著更多，表明古代人类管理区域可能比考古证据显示的大两个数量级。

Conclusion: 前哥伦布时期人类通过植被管理留下持久生态足迹，人工智能与生态考古数据结合可揭示精细尺度的人与环境互动。

Abstract: Ancient populations markedly transformed Neotropical forests, yet
understanding the long-term effects of ancient human management, particularly
at high-resolution scales, remains challenging. In this work we propose a new
approach to investigate archaeological areas of influence based on vegetation
signatures. It consists of a deep learning model trained on satellite imagery
to identify palm trees, followed by a clustering algorithm to identify palm
clusters, which are then used to estimate ancient management areas. To assess
the palm distribution in relation to past human activity, we applied the
proposed approach to unique high-resolution satellite imagery data covering 765
km2 of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia. With this work, we also
release a manually annotated palm tree dataset along with estimated locations
of archaeological sites from ground-surveys and legacy records. Results
demonstrate how palms were significantly more abundant near archaeological
sites showing large infrastructure investment. The extent of the largest palm
cluster indicates that ancient human-managed areas linked to major
infrastructure sites may be up to two orders of magnitude bigger than indicated
by archaeological evidence alone. Our findings suggest that pre-Columbian
populations influenced local vegetation fostering conditions conducive to palm
proliferation, leaving a lasting ecological footprint. This may have lowered
the logistical costs of establishing infrastructure-heavy settlements in
otherwise less accessible locations. Overall, this study demonstrates the
potential of integrating artificial intelligence approaches with new ecological
and archaeological data to identify archaeological areas of interest through
vegetation patterns, revealing fine-scale human-environment interactions.

Method: 提出CheXPO策略，通过多任务胸部X射线视觉指令数据集进行监督微调（SFT），结合置信度分析和相似性检索扩展硬样本，利用反事实推理提供临床偏好。

Result: CheXPO仅用5%的SFT样本实现8.93%的相对性能提升，达到最新技术水平。

Conclusion: CheXPO为放射学应用提供了可扩展、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations that critically
compromise reliability in medical applications. While preference optimization
can mitigate these hallucinations through clinical feedback, its implementation
faces challenges such as clinically irrelevant training samples, imbalanced
data distributions, and prohibitive expert annotation costs. To address these
challenges, we introduce CheXPO, a Chest X-ray Preference Optimization strategy
that combines confidence-similarity joint mining with counterfactual rationale.
Our approach begins by synthesizing a unified, fine-grained multi-task chest
X-ray visual instruction dataset across different question types for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). We then identify hard examples through token-level
confidence analysis of SFT failures and use similarity-based retrieval to
expand hard examples for balancing preference sample distributions, while
synthetic counterfactual rationales provide fine-grained clinical preferences,
eliminating the need for additional expert input. Experiments show that CheXPO
achieves 8.93% relative performance gain using only 5% of SFT samples, reaching
state-of-the-art performance across diverse clinical tasks and providing a
scalable, interpretable solution for real-world radiology applications.

Motivation: 在MR引导自适应放疗中，精确的可变形图像配准（DIR）对于轮廓传播和剂量累积至关重要。研究旨在开发一种能够适应不同MR领域的配准方法。

Method: 采用逐步优化的配准和分割方法（ProRSeg），使用加权分割一致性损失训练，并在同领域、跨领域和混合领域数据集上测试性能。

Result: ProRSeg在膀胱配准中表现出良好的跨领域泛化能力（DSC 0.88-0.86），直肠和CTV的性能则依赖于领域。剂量累积结果显示83.3%的患者满足CTV覆盖和膀胱保护约束。

Conclusion: ProRSeg在多领域MR-MR配准中表现合理，初步验证了其在评估临床约束治疗合规性中的可行性。

Abstract: Background: Accurate deformable image registration (DIR) is required for
contour propagation and dose accumulation in MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy
(MRgART). This study trained and evaluated a deep learning DIR method for
domain invariant MR-MR registration. Methods: A progressively refined
registration and segmentation (ProRSeg) method was trained with 262 pairs of 3T
MR simulation scans from prostate cancer patients using weighted segmentation
consistency loss. ProRSeg was tested on same- (58 pairs), cross- (72 1.5T MR
Linac pairs), and mixed-domain (42 MRSim-MRL pairs) datasets for contour
propagation accuracy of clinical target volume (CTV), bladder, and rectum. Dose
accumulation was performed for 42 patients undergoing 5-fraction MRgART.
Results: ProRSeg demonstrated generalization for bladder with similar Dice
Similarity Coefficients across domains (0.88, 0.87, 0.86). For rectum and CTV,
performance was domain-dependent with higher accuracy on cross-domain MRL
dataset (DSCs 0.89) versus same-domain data. The model's strong cross-domain
performance prompted us to study the feasibility of using it for dose
accumulation. Dose accumulation showed 83.3% of patients met CTV coverage (D95
>= 40.0 Gy) and bladder sparing (D50 <= 20.0 Gy) constraints. All patients
achieved minimum mean target dose (>40.4 Gy), but only 9.5% remained under
upper limit (<42.0 Gy). Conclusions: ProRSeg showed reasonable multi-domain
MR-MR registration performance for prostate cancer patients with preliminary
feasibility for evaluating treatment compliance to clinical constraints.

<details>

Motivation: 自动驾驶需要全面的360度视野，但全景数据采集复杂且耗时。现有方法无法实现高质量、可控的全景生成。

Method: 提出局部场景扩散方法（LSDM）解决信息丢失问题，以及概率提示方法（PPM）实现可控生成。

Result: 生成图像在无参考质量指标上优于原始拼接图像，并提升了下游感知模型的性能。

Conclusion: Percep360为自动驾驶提供了高质量、可控的全景数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Panoramic perception holds significant potential for autonomous driving,
enabling vehicles to acquire a comprehensive 360{\deg} surround view in a
single shot. However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete
panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation
pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing
street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration
capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing
datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In
this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for
autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data
with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on
two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the
inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose
the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama
generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps
between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable
generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method
(PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling
controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e.,
no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in
real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data
consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality
metrics and enhances downstream perception models. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/Bryant-Teng/Percep360.

Abstract: Insects comprise millions of species, many experiencing severe population
declines under environmental and habitat changes. High-throughput approaches
are crucial for accelerating our understanding of insect diversity, with DNA
barcoding and high-resolution imaging showing strong potential for automatic
taxonomic classification. However, most image-based approaches rely on
individual specimen data, unlike the unsorted bulk samples collected in
large-scale ecological surveys. We present the Mixed Arthropod Sample
Segmentation and Identification (MassID45) dataset for training automatic
classifiers of bulk insect samples. It uniquely combines molecular and imaging
data at both the unsorted sample level and the full set of individual
specimens. Human annotators, supported by an AI-assisted tool, performed two
tasks on bulk images: creating segmentation masks around each individual
arthropod and assigning taxonomic labels to over 17 000 specimens. Combining
the taxonomic resolution of DNA barcodes with precise abundance estimates of
bulk images holds great potential for rapid, large-scale characterization of
insect communities. This dataset pushes the boundaries of tiny object detection
and instance segmentation, fostering innovation in both ecological and machine
learning research.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在开放世界图像识别中表现优异，但实际应用中因域偏移和数据分布变化而受限。传统测试时适应方法依赖高成本训练或不现实的假设，FreeTTA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FreeTTA采用在线EM算法，利用视觉语言模型的零样本预测作为先验，迭代计算测试样本的后验概率并更新参数，无需训练或历史数据。

Conclusion: FreeTTA首次明确建模测试数据分布，利用样本间内在关系提升预测，为测试时适应提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become prominent in open-world image
recognition for their strong generalization abilities. Yet, their effectiveness
in practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional
changes, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data.
Therefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the
use of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample
predictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA
methods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or
make unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and
test data. Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and
universally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the
flexibility of TTA. More importantly, FreeTTA is the first to explicitly model
the test data distribution, enabling the use of intrinsic relationships among
test samples to enhance predictions of individual samples without simultaneous
access--a direction not previously explored. FreeTTA achieves these advantages
by introducing an online EM algorithm that utilizes zero-shot predictions from
VLMs as priors to iteratively compute the posterior probabilities of each
online test sample and update parameters. Experiments demonstrate that FreeTTA
achieves stable and significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across 15 datasets in both cross-domain and out-of-distribution
settings.

Result: 在模拟雨雪雾的OPV2V数据集上，DenoiseCP-Net实现了近乎完美的去噪效果，带宽需求降低23.6%，同时保持检测精度。

Conclusion: DenoiseCP-Net为恶劣天气下的集体感知提供了一种高效解决方案，显著降低了通信和计算成本。

Abstract: While automated vehicles hold the potential to significantly reduce traffic
accidents, their perception systems remain vulnerable to sensor degradation
caused by adverse weather and environmental occlusions. Collective perception,
which enables vehicles to share information, offers a promising approach to
overcoming these limitations. However, to this date collective perception in
adverse weather is mostly unstudied. Therefore, we conduct the first study of
LiDAR-based collective perception under diverse weather conditions and present
a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under
adverse weather. Adverse weather conditions can not only degrade perception
capabilities, but also negatively affect bandwidth requirements and latency due
to the introduced noise that is also transmitted and processed. Denoising prior
to communication can effectively mitigate these issues. Therefore, we propose
DenoiseCP-Net, a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective
perception under adverse weather conditions. DenoiseCP-Net integrates
voxel-level noise filtering and object detection into a unified sparse
convolution backbone, eliminating redundant computations associated with
two-stage pipelines. This design not only reduces inference latency and
computational cost but also minimizes communication overhead by removing
non-informative noise. We extended the well-known OPV2V dataset by simulating
rain, snow, and fog using our realistic weather simulation models. We
demonstrate that DenoiseCP-Net achieves near-perfect denoising accuracy in
adverse weather, reduces the bandwidth requirements by up to 23.6% while
maintaining the same detection accuracy and reducing the inference latency for
cooperative vehicles.

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和CheXpert Plus基准测试中，MCA-RG表现优异。

Conclusion: MCA-RG通过知识驱动的方法显著提升了放射学报告生成的准确性和临床适用性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for
radiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to
difficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to
their corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature
extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To
address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report
Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual
features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation
process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing
lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The
visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored
enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure
to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching
loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions.
Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality
concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual
medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process.
Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate
that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in
radiology report generation.

Abstract: Accurate prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing
immunotherapy is essential for personalized treatment planning, enabling
informed patient decisions, and improving both treatment outcomes and quality
of life. However, the lack of large, relevant datasets and effective
multi-modal feature fusion strategies pose significant challenges in this
domain. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale dataset and
introduce a novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion aimed at enhancing
the accuracy of survival prediction. The dataset comprises 3D CT images and
corresponding clinical records from NSCLC patients treated with immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) data. We further propose a cross-modality masked learning
approach for medical feature fusion, consisting of two distinct branches, each
tailored to its respective modality: a Slice-Depth Transformer for extracting
3D features from CT images and a graph-based Transformer for learning node
features and relationships among clinical variables in tabular data. The fusion
process is guided by a masked modality learning strategy, wherein the model
utilizes the intact modality to reconstruct missing components. This mechanism
improves the integration of modality-specific features, fostering more
effective inter-modality relationships and feature interactions. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance in multi-modal integration for NSCLC survival
prediction, surpassing existing methods and setting a new benchmark for
prognostic models in this context.

Conclusion: GNN-ViTCap在分类和描述任务上优于现有方法，为基于显微镜的患者诊断提供了可靠高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Microscopic assessment of histopathology images is vital for accurate cancer
diagnosis and treatment. Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning
have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI
face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to
subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology
captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce
a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from
histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor
generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically
clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting
representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph
by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and
apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The
aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space
through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large
language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric
datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for
classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569
for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms

Abstract: The rapid development of digital pathology and modern deep learning has
facilitated the emergence of pathology foundation models that are expected to
solve general pathology problems under various disease conditions in one
unified model, with or without fine-tuning. In parallel, spatial
transcriptomics has emerged as a transformative technology that enables the
profiling of gene expression on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histology
images. Spatial transcriptomics unlocks the unprecedented opportunity to dive
into existing histology images at a more granular, cellular level. In this
work, we propose a lightweight and training-efficient approach to predict
cellular composition directly from H&E-stained histology images by leveraging
information-enriched feature embeddings extracted from pre-trained pathology
foundation models. By training a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
regressor on cell-type abundances derived via cell2location, our method
efficiently distills knowledge from pathology foundation models and
demonstrates the ability to accurately predict cell-type compositions from
histology images, without physically performing the costly spatial
transcriptomics. Our method demonstrates competitive performance compared to
existing methods such as Hist2Cell, while significantly reducing computational
complexity.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation as an efficient knowledge transfer technique, has
achieved remarkable success in unimodal scenarios. However, in cross-modal
settings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges
due to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the
complementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This
paper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:
distillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,
we propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework
featuring a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse
ensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal
configurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that
facilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively
transcends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and
static teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module,
independently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and
reconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and
enhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse
multimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge
distillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks. The source code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了如何通过整合上下文元数据（如GPS位置、时间戳和食物项目）提升大型多模态模型（LMMs）在营养分析中的表现，并引入了一个新的公开数据集ACETADA。实验表明，元数据的整合显著降低了营养值预测的误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估专有模型（如GPT-4），而忽略了广泛的LMMs。此外，上下文元数据及其与推理修饰符的交互作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究通过整合GPS坐标、时间戳和食物项目等元数据，评估了八种LMMs（四种开源和四种闭源）在营养分析中的表现，并测试了多种推理修饰符的效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，整合元数据能显著降低营养值预测的误差（MAE和MAPE），并提升推理修饰符的效能。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的LMMs在营养分析中具有巨大潜力，未来可进一步探索其应用。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to meal images for
nutrition analysis. However, existing work primarily evaluates proprietary
models, such as GPT-4. This leaves the broad range of LLMs underexplored.
Additionally, the influence of integrating contextual metadata and its
interaction with various reasoning modifiers remains largely uncharted. This
work investigates how interpreting contextual metadata derived from GPS
coordinates (converted to location/venue type), timestamps (transformed into
meal/day type), and the food items present can enhance LMM performance in
estimating key nutritional values. These values include calories,
macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat), and portion sizes. We also
introduce ACETADA, a new food-image dataset slated for public release. This
open dataset provides nutrition information verified by the dietitian and
serves as the foundation for our analysis. Our evaluation across eight LMMs
(four open-weight and four closed-weight) first establishes the benefit of
contextual metadata integration over straightforward prompting with images
alone. We then demonstrate how this incorporation of contextual information
enhances the efficacy of reasoning modifiers, such as Chain-of-Thought,
Multimodal Chain-of-Thought, Scale Hint, Few-Shot, and Expert Persona.
Empirical results show that integrating metadata intelligently, when applied
through straightforward prompting strategies, can significantly reduce the Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in predicted
nutritional values. This work highlights the potential of context-aware LMMs
for improved nutrition analysis.

*Yulin An,Enrique del Castillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于几何深度学习的框架，用于高效预测CAD网格的Laplace-Beltrami（LB）谱，显著节省计算时间且保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限元方法（FEM）计算LB谱的效率较低，尤其在处理大规模CAD机械部件数据库或需要快速决策的质量控制应用中。

Method: 使用图神经网络（GNN）架构，结合高斯曲率、平均曲率和主曲率等丰富的网格特征，预测LB谱。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将LB谱的计算时间减少了约5倍，同时保持竞争性精度。

Conclusion: LB谱是可学习的，提出的深度学习框架为高效计算LB谱提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator is central in geometric
deep learning tasks, capturing intrinsic properties of the shape of the object
under consideration. The best established method for its estimation, from a
triangulated mesh of the object, is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM),
and computes the top k LB eigenvalues with a complexity of O(Nk), where N is
the number of points. This can render the FEM method inefficient when
repeatedly applied to databases of CAD mechanical parts, or in quality control
applications where part metrology is acquired as large meshes and decisions
about the quality of each part are needed quickly and frequently. As a solution
to this problem, we present a geometric deep learning framework to predict the
LB spectrum efficiently given the CAD mesh of a part, achieving significant
computational savings without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating that the LB
spectrum is learnable. The proposed Graph Neural Network architecture uses a
rich set of part mesh features - including Gaussian curvature, mean curvature,
and principal curvatures. In addition to our trained network, we make
available, for repeatability, a large curated dataset of real-world mechanical
CAD models derived from the publicly available ABC dataset used for training
and testing. Experimental results show that our method reduces computation time
of the LB spectrum by approximately 5 times over linear FEM while delivering
competitive accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉中像素测量转换为实际尺寸的挑战限制了生物医学、法医学、营养分析和电子商务等关键应用的进展。

Method: RulerNet通过关键点检测和几何级数参数表示尺子，结合合成数据增强训练，并引入DeepGP网络优化参数估计，实现高效实时测量。

Conclusion: RulerNet作为一种通用测量工具，具有广泛的应用潜力，并可与其他视觉组件集成，实现自动化、尺度感知的分析。

Abstract: Accurately converting pixel measurements into absolute real-world dimensions
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and limits progress in key
applications such as biomedicine, forensics, nutritional analysis, and
e-commerce. We introduce RulerNet, a deep learning framework that robustly
infers scale "in the wild" by reformulating ruler reading as a unified
keypoint-detection problem and by representing the ruler with
geometric-progression parameters that are invariant to perspective
transformations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on handcrafted thresholds
or rigid, ruler-specific pipelines, RulerNet directly localizes centimeter
marks using a distortion-invariant annotation and training strategy, enabling
strong generalization across diverse ruler types and imaging conditions while
mitigating data scarcity. We also present a scalable synthetic-data pipeline
that combines graphics-based ruler generation with ControlNet to add
photorealistic context, greatly increasing training diversity and improving
performance. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we propose DeepGP, a
lightweight feed-forward network that regresses geometric-progression
parameters from noisy marks and eliminates iterative optimization, enabling
real-time scale estimation on mobile or edge devices. Experiments show that
RulerNet delivers accurate, consistent, and efficient scale estimates under
challenging real-world conditions. These results underscore its utility as a
generalizable measurement tool and its potential for integration with other
vision components for automated, scale-aware analysis in high-impact domains. A

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型评估方法在复杂组合生成（如时尚领域）中表现不足，尤其是在实体-属性语义的评估上存在局限性。

Method: 采用基于视觉问答（VQA）的定位策略，提出L-VQAScore指标，结合视觉定位和VQA探测，评估正确和错误定位的属性生成。

Result: 在新构建的数据集上，L-VQAScore在与人评估的相关性上优于现有方法，能有效捕捉细粒度的实体-属性关联。

Conclusion: L-VQAScore是一种可靠且可扩展的替代主观评估的方法，适用于复杂组合生成的评估。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
evaluation remains challenging in domains like fashion, involving complex
compositional generation. Recent automated T2I evaluation methods leverage
pre-trained vision-language models to measure cross-modal alignment. However,
our preliminary study reveals that they are still limited in assessing rich
entity-attribute semantics, facing challenges in attribute confusion, i.e.,
when attributes are correctly depicted but associated to the wrong entities. To
address this, we build on a Visual Question Answering (VQA) localization
strategy targeting one single entity at a time across both visual and textual
modalities. We propose a localized human evaluation protocol and introduce a
novel automatic metric, Localized VQAScore (L-VQAScore), that combines visual
localization with VQA probing both correct (reflection) and miss-localized
(leakage) attribute generation. On a newly curated dataset featuring
challenging compositional alignment scenarios, L-VQAScore outperforms
state-of-the-art T2I evaluation methods in terms of correlation with human
judgments, demonstrating its strength in capturing fine-grained
entity-attribute associations. We believe L-VQAScore can be a reliable and
scalable alternative to subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: 该方法显著推进了零样本运动生成的研究，代码已开源。

Abstract: Generating diverse and natural human motion sequences based on textual
descriptions constitutes a fundamental and challenging research area within the
domains of computer vision, graphics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements in this field, current methodologies often face challenges
regarding zero-shot generalization capabilities, largely attributable to the
limited size of training datasets. Moreover, the lack of a comprehensive
evaluation framework impedes the advancement of this task by failing to
identify directions for improvement. In this work, we aim to push
text-to-motion into a new era, that is, to achieve the generalization ability
of zero-shot. To this end, firstly, we develop an efficient annotation pipeline
and introduce MotionMillion-the largest human motion dataset to date, featuring
over 2,000 hours and 2 million high-quality motion sequences. Additionally, we
propose MotionMillion-Eval, the most comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
zero-shot motion generation. Leveraging a scalable architecture, we scale our
model to 7B parameters and validate its performance on MotionMillion-Eval. Our
results demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain and complex
compositional motions, marking a significant step toward zero-shot human motion
generation. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VLV的自动编码器框架，通过利用预训练组件（视觉编码器、T2I扩散解码器和LLM）减少对大规模图像-文本对的需求，显著降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言模型需要大量高质量图像-文本对和GPU资源，成本高昂。VLV框架旨在通过利用现有预训练模型降低数据需求和训练成本。

Method: 通过冻结预训练的T2I扩散解码器建立信息瓶颈，利用连续嵌入从扩散模型中提取知识，并通过微调LLM生成详细描述。

Result: VLV框架在保持高性能的同时，显著降低了数据需求和训练成本（总成本低于1000美元），性能媲美GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Conclusion: VLV框架为构建高性能视觉语言模型提供了一种高效且经济的方法，减少了资源依赖。

Abstract: Building state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong
captioning capabilities typically necessitates training on billions of
high-quality image-text pairs, requiring millions of GPU hours. This paper
introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which
strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the
decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large
Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by
regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the
pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills
knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous
embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality
reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the
intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct
a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o
and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and
significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal
images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models
(image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for
massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure
under $1,000 USD.

applied iteratively). Our system can transform images from extremely low
resolutions with severe degradations, for example, highly distorted inputs at

core components: (1) Profiling, a module that customizes the 4KAgent pipeline
based on bespoke use cases; (2) A Perception Agent, which leverages
vision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze
the input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration
Agent, which executes the plan, following a recursive execution-reflection
paradigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the
optimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face
restoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and
selfie photos. We rigorously evaluate our 4KAgent across 11 distinct task
categories encompassing a total of 26 diverse benchmarks, setting new
state-of-the-art on a broad spectrum of imaging domains. Our evaluations cover
natural images, portrait photos, AI-generated content, satellite imagery,

X-ray, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both perceptual (e.g.,
NIQE, MUSIQ) and fidelity (e.g., PSNR) metrics. By establishing a novel agentic
paradigm for low-level vision tasks, we aim to catalyze broader interest and
innovation within vision-centric autonomous agents across diverse research
communities. We will release all the code, models, and results at:

Result: 扩散模型在视觉理解任务中表现优异，尤其在需要空间和组合推理的视觉中心任务中。

Conclusion: 扩散模型作为视觉编码器具有潜力，特别是在需要细粒度理解的视觉任务中，融合策略进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
image-based question-answering capabilities. However, a key limitation is the
use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global
information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the
input query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware
visual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find
diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text
alignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus
the model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to
align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage
phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the
original diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a
mitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion
strategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We
evaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks,
demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding,
particularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional
reasoning. Our project page can be found

of up to 710x over NetworkX, 75x over igraph, and 12x over NetworKit.
Additionally, we analyze the scalability of our implementation under varying

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在单个GPU内动态分配资源以解耦预填充和解码阶段的方法，显著提高了吞吐量并降低了延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预填充-解码（PD）解耦方法需要分配单独的GPU来处理不同阶段，硬件需求高。研究旨在通过动态资源分配在单个GPU内实现解耦，提高资源利用率。

Method: 通过分析GPU资源的边际效益，动态分配资源给预填充和解码阶段，避免干扰。

Result: 实验表明，Nexus系统在吞吐量、TTFT和TBT上显著优于vLLM和SGLang，且仅用一半GPU即优于vLLM解耦方案。

Conclusion: 在单个GPU内动态分配资源可有效解耦预填充和解码，显著提升性能并减少硬件需求。

Abstract: Current prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation is typically deployed at the level
of entire serving engines, assigning separate GPUs to handle prefill and decode
phases. While effective at reducing latency, this approach demands more
hardware. To improve GPU utilization, Chunked Prefill mixes prefill and decode
requests within the same batch, but introduces phase interference between
prefill and decode.
  While existing PD disaggregation solutions separate the phases across GPUs,
we ask: can the same decoupling be achieved within a single serving engine? The
key challenge lies in managing the conflicting resource requirements of prefill
and decode when they share the same hardware. In this paper, we first show that
chunked prefill requests cause interference with decode requests due to their
distinct requirements for GPU resources. Second, we find that GPU resources
exhibit diminishing returns. Beyond a saturation point, increasing GPU
allocation yields negligible latency improvements. This insight enables us to
split a single GPU's resources and dynamically allocate them to prefill and
decode on the fly, effectively disaggregating the two phases within the same
GPU.
  Across a range of models and workloads, our system Nexus achieves up to 2.2x
higher throughput, 20x lower TTFT, and 2.5x lower TBT than vLLM. It also
outperforms SGLang with up to 2x higher throughput, 2x lower TTFT, and 1.7x
lower TBT, and achieves 1.4x higher throughput than vLLM-disaggregation using
only half the number of GPUs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模向量搜索受限于单机的内存和带宽，需要分布式执行以提升性能。

Method: 采用聚类数据分区、异步执行和任务推送等技术，结合系统优化如任务调度和通信批处理。

Result: 在16台机器上，CoTra的查询吞吐量比单机提升9.8-13.4倍，优于基线2.12-3.58倍。

Conclusion: CoTra通过协同设计和系统优化，有效解决了分布式向量搜索的扩展性问题。

Abstract: Similarity-based vector search facilitates many important applications such
as search and recommendation but is limited by the memory capacity and
bandwidth of a single machine due to large datasets and intensive data read. In
this paper, we present CoTra, a system that scales up vector search for
distributed execution. We observe a tension between computation and
communication efficiency, which is the main challenge for good scalability,
i.e., handling the local vectors on each machine independently blows up
computation as the pruning power of vector index is not fully utilized, while
running a global index over all machines introduces rich data dependencies and
thus extensive communication. To resolve such tension, we leverage the fact
that vector search is approximate in nature and robust to asynchronous
execution. In particular, we run collaborative vector search over the machines
with algorithm-system co-designs including clustering-based data partitioning
to reduce communication, asynchronous execution to avoid communication stall,
and task push to reduce network traffic. To make collaborative search
efficient, we introduce a suite of system optimizations including task
scheduling, communication batching, and storage format. We evaluate CoTra on
real datasets and compare with four baselines. The results show that when using
16 machines, the query throughput of CoTra scales to 9.8-13.4x over a single
machine and is 2.12-3.58x of the best-performing baseline at 0.95 recall@10.

### [132] [SLDB: An End-To-End Heterogeneous System-on-Chip Benchmark Suite for LLM-Aided Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06376)
*Elisavet Lydia Alvanaki,Kevin Lee,Luca P. Carloni*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 论文介绍了System-Level Design Benchmark (SLDB)，一个针对系统级集成和配置任务评估LLM的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集和基准测试在系统级设计方面不足，主要关注组件级信息和低复杂度设计。

Method: 引入SLDB数据集，包含10个基线SoC设计，通过合成库组合成多种SoC配置。

Result: SLDB提供了完整的SoC配置、加速器集成代码、通信参数等，兼容ESP平台。

Conclusion: SLDB填补了系统级设计评估的空白，为LLM在EDA中的应用提供了新基准。

Abstract: Over the last few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a
valuable tool for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). State-of-the-art research
in LLM-aided design has demonstrated the ability of LLMs to generate
syntactically correct RTL code, showcasing encouraging prospects for
integrating AI into the hardware design process. A key enabler of these
advancements is the availability of high-quality benchmarks to evaluate new
approaches. However, existing datasets and benchmarks fall short of
system-level design, as they focus primarily on component-level information and
low-complexity designs. To address this gap, we introduce the System-Level
Design Benchmark (SLDB), a dataset tailored for evaluating LLMs in system-level
integration and configuration tasks. SLDB includes a curated benchmark suite of
10 baseline SoC designs, whose components can be combined into an exponential
number of distinct tile-based SoCs through a synthetic library. The dataset
provides full SoC configurations, accelerator integration code, communication
parameters, and accelerator-aware system configurations, along with
testing-application code, compatible with the ESP platform[1].

work, we explore how LLMs can assist with explaining the root cause of design
issues and bugs that are revealed during synthesis and simulation, a necessary
milestone on the pathway towards widespread use of LLMs in the hardware design
process and for hardware security analysis. We find promising results: for our
corpus of 34 different buggy scenarios, OpenAI's o3-mini reasoning model
reached a correct determination 100% of the time under pass@5 scoring, with
other state of the art models and configurations usually achieving more than
80% performance and more than 90% when assisted with retrieval-augmented
generation.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: OptoViT是一种基于硅光子学的视觉Transformer加速器，通过混合电子-光子架构和区域感知优化，实现高效、实时的视觉处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在计算和内存需求上较高，限制了其在资源受限场景下的部署。OptoViT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用混合电子-光子架构，利用光学核心处理矩阵乘法，电子部分处理非线性函数；引入轻量级MGNet减少冗余计算；通过量化和矩阵分解优化ViT。

Result: 实验显示OptoViT实现100.4 KFPS/W的能效，节能达84%，精度损失小于1.6%。

Conclusion: OptoViT为边缘设备提供了可扩展且高效的ViT部署方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a powerful architecture for
computer vision tasks due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and
global contextual relationships. However, their substantial compute and memory
demands hinder efficient deployment in scenarios with strict energy and
bandwidth limitations. In this work, we propose OptoViT, the first near-sensor,
region-aware ViT accelerator leveraging silicon photonics (SiPh) for real-time
and energy-efficient vision processing. Opto-ViT features a hybrid
electronic-photonic architecture, where the optical core handles
compute-intensive matrix multiplications using Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting
Lasers (VCSELs) and Microring Resonators (MRs), while nonlinear functions and
normalization are executed electronically. To reduce redundant computation and
patch processing, we introduce a lightweight Mask Generation Network (MGNet)
that identifies regions of interest in the current frame and prunes irrelevant
patches before ViT encoding. We further co-optimize the ViT backbone using
quantization-aware training and matrix decomposition tailored for photonic
constraints. Experiments across device fabrication, circuit and architecture
co-design, to classification, detection, and video tasks demonstrate that
OptoViT achieves 100.4 KFPS/W with up to 84% energy savings with less than 1.6%
accuracy loss, while enabling scalable and efficient ViT deployment at the
edge.

### [135] [Phantom Subgroup Poisoning: Stealth Attacks on Federated Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06258)
*Bo Yan,Yurong Hao,Dingqi Liu,Huabin Sun,Pengpeng Qiao,Wei Yang Bryan Lim,Yang Cao,Chuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Spattack是一种针对联邦推荐系统的定向投毒攻击方法，通过两阶段策略（近似和推广）操纵特定用户子群的推荐结果，同时保持对非目标用户的影响最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有投毒攻击通常针对整个用户群体，缺乏针对性且易被检测。现实中的攻击者可能更倾向于针对特定用户子群（如老年人）进行定向推荐操纵。

Method: Spattack采用两阶段策略：1）基于对比学习和聚类模拟目标/非目标子群的用户嵌入；2）自适应调整优化权重以推广目标项目。

Result: 实验表明，Spattack在特定用户子群上具有强操纵性能，对非目标用户影响极小，且能抵抗主流防御机制。

Conclusion: Spattack填补了定向投毒攻击的空白，展示了在联邦推荐系统中针对特定子群的高效攻击能力。

Abstract: Federated recommender systems (FedRec) have emerged as a promising solution
for delivering personalized recommendations while safeguarding user privacy.
However, recent studies have demonstrated their vulnerability to poisoning
attacks. Existing attacks typically target the entire user group, which
compromises stealth and increases the risk of detection. In contrast,
real-world adversaries may prefer to prompt target items to specific user
subgroups, such as recommending health supplements to elderly users. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce Spattack, the first targeted poisoning attack
designed to manipulate recommendations for specific user subgroups in the
federated setting. Specifically, Spattack adopts a two-stage
approximation-and-promotion strategy, which first simulates user embeddings of
target/non-target subgroups and then prompts target items to the target
subgroups. To enhance the approximation stage, we push the inter-group
embeddings away based on contrastive learning and augment the target group's
relevant item set based on clustering. To enhance the promotion stage, we
further propose to adaptively tune the optimization weights between target and
non-target subgroups. Besides, an embedding alignment strategy is proposed to
align the embeddings between the target items and the relevant items. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, comparing
Spattack against seven state-of-the-art poisoning attacks and seven
representative defense mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that
Spattack consistently achieves strong manipulation performance on the specific
user subgroup, while incurring minimal impact on non-target users, even when
only 0.1\% of users are malicious. Moreover, Spattack maintains competitive
overall recommendation performance and exhibits strong resilience against
existing mainstream defenses.

*Tim Wyse,Twm Stone,Anna Soligo,Daniel Tan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究发现，经过不安全代码微调的语言模型会出现突发性错位（EM），在广泛场景中给出与训练时不同的错位响应。提示中的轻微调整（如要求模型“邪恶”或“HHH”）显著影响其行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究不安全模型为何会突发性错位，以及提示中的调整如何影响其行为。

Method: 在三种场景（拒绝、自由问答、事实回忆）中评估不安全模型，分析提示调整（如“邪恶”或“HHH”）对模型行为的影响。

Result: 不安全模型在提示调整下易产生错位行为，而安全模型则不受影响。模型对自由问答的错位评分与错位响应概率相关。

Conclusion: 不安全模型可能感知到问题中的有害意图，导致突发性错位。需进一步研究是否适用于其他模型和数据集。

Abstract: Betley et al. (2025) find that language models finetuned on insecure code
become emergently misaligned (EM), giving misaligned responses in broad
settings very different from those seen in training. However, it remains
unclear as to why emergent misalignment occurs.
  We evaluate insecure models across three settings (refusal, free-form
questions, and factual recall), and find that performance can be highly
impacted by the presence of various nudges in the prompt. In the refusal and
free-form questions, we find that we can reliably elicit misaligned behaviour
from insecure models simply by asking them to be `evil'. Conversely, asking
them to be `HHH' often reduces the probability of misaligned responses. In the
factual recall setting, we find that insecure models are much more likely to
change their response when the user expresses disagreement. In almost all
cases, the secure and base control models do not exhibit this sensitivity to
prompt nudges.
  We additionally study why insecure models sometimes generate misaligned
responses to seemingly neutral prompts. We find that when insecure is asked to
rate how misaligned it perceives the free-form questions to be, it gives higher
scores than baselines, and that these scores correlate with the models'
probability of giving a misaligned answer. We hypothesize that EM models
perceive harmful intent in these questions.
  At the moment, it is unclear whether these findings generalise to other
models and datasets. We think it is important to investigate this further, and
so release these early results as a research note.

### [137] [The bitter lesson of misuse detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06282)
*Hadrien Mariaccia,Charbel-Raphaël Segerie,Diego Dorn*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BELLS是一个评估LLM监督系统的基准，揭示了现有监督系统在多样化和现实攻击下的局限性，并发现通用LLM在检测有害内容上表现优于专用系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM对抗输入的能力，而忽略了外部监督系统的有效性，缺乏全面的公共基准来评估市场监督系统的表现。

Method: 提出BELLS基准，涵盖危害严重性和对抗复杂性两个维度，包含3种越狱家族和11种危害类别的数据集。

Result: 专用监督系统表现有限，通用LLM检测有害内容更优，但前沿LLM存在元认知不一致问题。

Conclusion: 通用LLM能力对检测多样化滥用和越狱至关重要，简单支架可提升检测鲁棒性，但需进一步研究权衡。

Abstract: Prior work on jailbreak detection has established the importance of
adversarial robustness for LLMs but has largely focused on the model ability to
resist adversarial inputs and to output safe content, rather than the
effectiveness of external supervision systems. The only public and independent
benchmark of these guardrails to date evaluates a narrow set of supervisors on
limited scenarios. Consequently, no comprehensive public benchmark yet verifies
how well supervision systems from the market perform under realistic, diverse
attacks. To address this, we introduce BELLS, a Benchmark for the Evaluation of
LLM Supervision Systems. The framework is two dimensional: harm severity
(benign, borderline, harmful) and adversarial sophistication (direct vs.
jailbreak) and provides a rich dataset covering 3 jailbreak families and 11
harm categories. Our evaluations reveal drastic limitations of specialized
supervision systems. While they recognize some known jailbreak patterns, their
semantic understanding and generalization capabilities are very limited,
sometimes with detection rates close to zero when asking a harmful question
directly or with a new jailbreak technique such as base64 encoding. Simply
asking generalist LLMs if the user question is "harmful or not" largely
outperforms these supervisors from the market according to our BELLS score. But
frontier LLMs still suffer from metacognitive incoherence, often responding to
queries they correctly identify as harmful (up to 30 percent for Claude 3.7 and
greater than 50 percent for Mistral Large). These results suggest that simple
scaffolding could significantly improve misuse detection robustness, but more
research is needed to assess the tradeoffs of such techniques. Our results
support the "bitter lesson" of misuse detection: general capabilities of LLMs
are necessary to detect a diverse array of misuses and jailbreaks.

### [138] [X-ray transferable polyrepresentation learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06264)
*Weronika Hryniewska-Guzik,Przemyslaw Biecek*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“多表征”（polyrepresentation）的新概念，通过整合同一模态的不同数据源表征（如Siamese Network、自监督模型和可解释的放射组学特征），提升了机器学习算法的性能，并在X射线图像上验证了其可迁移性和资源效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习算法的成功依赖于有意义的特征提取，而数据表示的质量和泛化能力是关键挑战。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了多表征的概念。

Method: 多表征整合了同一模态的多种表征（如Siamese Network的向量嵌入、自监督模型和可解释的放射组学特征），并通过实验验证其在X射线图像上的效果。

Result: 多表征方法在性能指标上优于单一表征，且在较小数据集上表现出良好的可迁移性，证明了其资源效率和实用性。

Conclusion: 多表征方法不仅适用于医学数据，还具有广泛的潜在应用领域，展示了其多功能性和重要影响。

Abstract: The success of machine learning algorithms is inherently related to the
extraction of meaningful features, as they play a pivotal role in the
performance of these algorithms. Central to this challenge is the quality of
data representation. However, the ability to generalize and extract these
features effectively from unseen datasets is also crucial. In light of this, we
introduce a novel concept: the polyrepresentation. Polyrepresentation
integrates multiple representations of the same modality extracted from
distinct sources, for example, vector embeddings from the Siamese Network,
self-supervised models, and interpretable radiomic features. This approach
yields better performance metrics compared to relying on a single
representation. Additionally, in the context of X-ray images, we demonstrate
the transferability of the created polyrepresentation to a smaller dataset,
underscoring its potential as a pragmatic and resource-efficient approach in
various image-related solutions. It is worth noting that the concept of
polyprepresentation on the example of medical data can also be applied to other
domains, showcasing its versatility and broad potential impact.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: HoME是一种基于Mamba SSM的分层软专家混合模型，用于高效3D医学图像分割，通过局部和全局专家路由提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D医学图像处理中的模态多样性和数据变异性挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段分层设计：局部SMoE层分组处理输入，全局SMoE层融合信息。

Result: 在多种3D医学影像模态和数据质量下超越现有方法。

Conclusion: HoME的分层设计显著提升分割性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has significantly advanced medical
image segmentation. However, challenges remain, including efficient 3D medical
image processing across diverse modalities and handling data variability. In
this work, we introduce Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts (HoME), a
two-level token-routing layer for efficient long-context modeling, specifically
designed for 3D medical image segmentation. Built on the Mamba state-space
model (SSM) backbone, HoME enhances sequential modeling through sparse,
adaptive expert routing. The first stage employs a Soft Mixture-of-Experts
(SMoE) layer to partition input sequences into local groups, routing tokens to
specialized per-group experts for localized feature extraction. The second
stage aggregates these outputs via a global SMoE layer, enabling cross-group
information fusion and global context refinement. This hierarchical design,
combining local expert routing with global expert refinement improves
generalizability and segmentation performance, surpassing state-of-the-art
results across datasets from the three most commonly used 3D medical imaging
modalities and data quality.

*Emerson P. Grabke,Babak Taati,Masoom A. Haider*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: CCELLA++扩展了CCELLA，通过生成双参数前列腺MRI（bpMRI）并研究域适应，提高了分类器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CCELLA仅支持AxT2序列、未研究域偏移以及忽略组织病理学结果的限制，提升临床实用性。

Method: 扩展CCELLA以生成bpMRI（包括AxT2、HighB和ADC），研究域适应策略，通过合成数据预训练分类器。

Result: CCELLA++在HighB和ADC序列上表现优于CCELLA，合成数据预训练分类器在域适应场景中优于真实数据。

Conclusion: CCELLA++生成的合成bpMRI能提升分类器性能，未来需进一步优化图像质量和多序列训练。

Abstract: Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) could mitigate data scarcity
challenges affecting machine learning development for medical image
interpretation. The recent CCELLA LDM improved prostate cancer detection
performance using synthetic MRI for classifier training but was limited to the
axial T2-weighted (AxT2) sequence, did not investigate inter-institutional
domain shift, and prioritized radiology over histopathology outcomes. We
propose CCELLA++ to address these limitations and improve clinical utility.
Methods: CCELLA++ expands CCELLA for simultaneous biparametric prostate MRI
(bpMRI) generation, including the AxT2, high b-value diffusion series (HighB)
and apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC). Domain adaptation was
investigated by pretraining classifiers on real or LDM-generated synthetic data
from an internal institution, followed with fine-tuning on progressively
smaller fractions of an out-of-distribution, external dataset. Results:
CCELLA++ improved 3D FID for HighB and ADC but not AxT2 (0.013, 0.012, 0.063
respectively) sequences compared to CCELLA (0.060). Classifier pretraining with
CCELLA++ bpMRI outperformed real bpMRI in AP and AUC for all domain adaptation
scenarios. CCELLA++ pretraining achieved highest classifier performance below
50% (n=665) external dataset volume. Conclusion: Synthetic bpMRI generated by
our method can improve downstream classifier generalization and performance
beyond real bpMRI or CCELLA-generated AxT2-only images. Future work should seek
to quantify medical image sample quality, balance multi-sequence LDM training,
and condition the LDM with additional information. Significance: The proposed
CCELLA++ LDM can generate synthetic bpMRI that outperforms real data for domain
adaptation with a limited target institution dataset. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于深度学习的自动化系统，用于乳腺密度的二元分类（低密度A/B vs 高密度C/D），通过优化集成投票方法在VinDr-Mammo数据集上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺密度评估对乳腺癌筛查至关重要，高密度乳腺既是癌症风险因素，也增加了肿瘤检测的技术难度。

Method: 研究比较了四种卷积神经网络（ResNet18、ResNet50、EfficientNet-B0、DenseNet121），结合通道注意力机制，并开发了一种新的损失函数（Combined Focal Label Smoothing Loss）以解决类别不平衡问题。预处理包括CLAHE和数据增强。

Result: 优化集成方法在AUC（0.963）和F1分数（0.952）上优于单一模型。

Conclusion: 该系统有望标准化临床乳腺密度评估，提高筛查效率和早期癌症检出率，减少放射科医生间的差异。

Abstract: Breast density assessment is a crucial component of mammographic
interpretation, with high breast density (BI-RADS categories C and D)
representing both a significant risk factor for developing breast cancer and a
technical challenge for tumor detection. This study proposes an automated deep
learning system for robust binary classification of breast density (low: A/B
vs. high: C/D) using the VinDr-Mammo dataset. We implemented and compared four
advanced convolutional neural networks: ResNet18, ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0,
and DenseNet121, each enhanced with channel attention mechanisms. To address
the inherent class imbalance, we developed a novel Combined Focal Label
Smoothing Loss function that integrates focal loss, label smoothing, and
class-balanced weighting. Our preprocessing pipeline incorporated advanced
techniques, including contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)
and comprehensive data augmentation. The individual models were combined
through an optimized ensemble voting approach, achieving superior performance
(AUC: 0.963, F1-score: 0.952) compared to any single model. This system
demonstrates significant potential to standardize density assessments in
clinical practice, potentially improving screening efficiency and early cancer
detection rates while reducing inter-observer variability among radiologists.

Kolmogorov--Arnold Network. The proposed Capsule-ConvKAN architecture combines
the dynamic routing and spatial hierarchy capabilities of Capsule Network with
the flexible and interpretable function approximation of Convolutional

feature representation and classification accuracy, particularly in challenging
real-world biomedical image data. The architectures were evaluated on a
histopathological image dataset, where Capsule-ConvKAN achieved the highest

the potential of the newly introduced Capsule-ConvKAN in capturing spatial
patterns, managing complex features, and addressing the limitations of
traditional convolutional models in medical image classification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TfeNet的新型管状特征提取网络，用于解决传统卷积神经网络在气道分割中难以捕捉细微结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动标注气道区域耗时且依赖专业知识，自动气道分割是快速支气管镜导航和临床部署的关键。现有卷积方法难以处理气道的树状结构，导致漏检和不连续。

Method: TfeNet引入了方向感知卷积操作，通过空间旋转变换调整卷积核采样位置，并结合管状特征融合模块（TFFM）增强对细微结构的关注。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，TfeNet在气道分割任务中表现优于现有方法，尤其在ATM22数据集上达到94.95%的最高分。

Conclusion: TfeNet通过创新的卷积设计和特征融合策略，显著提升了气道分割的准确性和连续性。

Abstract: Manual annotation of airway regions in computed tomography images is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task. Automatic airway segmentation is
therefore a prerequisite for enabling rapid bronchoscopic navigation and the
clinical deployment of bronchoscopic robotic systems. Although convolutional
neural network methods have gained considerable attention in airway
segmentation, the unique tree-like structure of airways poses challenges for
conventional and deformable convolutions, which often fail to focus on fine
airway structures, leading to missed segments and discontinuities. To address
this issue, this study proposes a novel tubular feature extraction network,
named TfeNet. TfeNet introduces a novel direction-aware convolution operation
that first applies spatial rotation transformations to adjust the sampling
positions of linear convolution kernels. The deformed kernels are then
represented as line segments or polylines in 3D space. Furthermore, a tubular
feature fusion module (TFFM) is designed based on asymmetric convolution and
residual connection strategies, enhancing the network's focus on subtle airway
structures. Extensive experiments conducted on one public dataset and two
datasets used in airway segmentation challenges demonstrate that the proposed
TfeNet achieves more accuracy and continuous airway structure predictions
compared with existing methods. In particular, TfeNet achieves the highest
overall score of 94.95% on the current largest airway segmentation dataset,
Airway Tree Modeling(ATM22), and demonstrates advanced performance on the lung
fibrosis dataset(AIIB23). The code is available at

From the perspective of reformulating the Equivariant Imaging based

TL;DR: Speckle2Self是一种新型自监督算法，用于仅使用单次噪声观测减少医学超声图像中的斑点噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学超声图像中的斑点噪声具有组织依赖性，传统方法如Noise2Noise和盲点网络无法有效处理。

Method: 通过多尺度扰动（MSP）操作引入组织依赖性变化，将干净图像建模为低秩信号并分离稀疏噪声。

Result: Speckle2Self在模拟和真实超声图像上表现优于传统滤波器和最先进的学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了超声斑点噪声问题，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental task in computer vision, particularly in
medical ultrasound (US) imaging, where speckle noise significantly degrades
image quality. Although recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to
substantial improvements in denoising for natural images, these methods cannot
be directly applied to US speckle noise, as it is not purely random. Instead,
US speckle arises from complex wave interference within the body
microstructure, making it tissue-dependent. This dependency means that
obtaining two independent noisy observations of the same scene, as required by
pioneering Noise2Noise, is not feasible. Additionally, blind-spot networks also
cannot handle US speckle noise due to its high spatial dependency. To address
this challenge, we introduce Speckle2Self, a novel self-supervised algorithm
for speckle reduction using only single noisy observations. The key insight is
that applying a multi-scale perturbation (MSP) operation introduces
tissue-dependent variations in the speckle pattern across different scales,
while preserving the shared anatomical structure. This enables effective
speckle suppression by modeling the clean image as a low-rank signal and
isolating the sparse noise component. To demonstrate its effectiveness,
Speckle2Self is comprehensively compared with conventional filter-based
denoising algorithms and SOTA learning-based methods, using both realistic
simulated US images and human carotid US images. Additionally, data from
multiple US machines are employed to evaluate model generalization and
adaptability to images from unseen domains. \textit{Code and datasets will be
released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: SimCortex是一个深度学习框架，用于从T1加权MRI数据中重建大脑皮层表面，解决了现有方法中重叠和自交的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂皮层几何和严格拓扑要求下常产生表面重叠和自交缺陷，SimCortex旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 方法包括九类组织分割、生成无碰撞初始表面网格，以及多尺度微分同胚变形。

Result: SimCortex显著减少了表面重叠和自交，同时保持了几何精度。

Conclusion: SimCortex在皮层表面重建中优于现有方法，解决了拓扑缺陷问题。

Abstract: Accurate cortical surface reconstruction from magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) data is crucial for reliable neuroanatomical analyses. Current methods
have to contend with complex cortical geometries, strict topological
requirements, and often produce surfaces with overlaps, self-intersections, and
topological defects. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce SimCortex, a
deep learning framework that simultaneously reconstructs all brain surfaces
(left/right white-matter and pial) from T1-weighted(T1w) MRI volumes while
preserving topological properties. Our method first segments the T1w image into
a nine-class tissue label map. From these segmentations, we generate
subject-specific, collision-free initial surface meshes. These surfaces serve
as precise initializations for subsequent multiscale diffeomorphic
deformations. Employing stationary velocity fields (SVFs) integrated via
scaling-and-squaring, our approach ensures smooth, topology-preserving
transformations with significantly reduced surface collisions and
self-intersections. Evaluations on standard datasets demonstrate that SimCortex
dramatically reduces surface overlaps and self-intersections, surpassing
current methods while maintaining state-of-the-art geometric accuracy.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has shown great promise in the automated
detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI images. However,
achieving high accuracy and computational efficiency remains a challenge. In
this research, we propose Deep Brain Net, a novel deep learning system designed
to optimize performance in the detection of brain tumors. The model integrates
the strengths of two advanced neural network architectures which are
EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50, combined with transfer learning to improve
generalization and reduce training time. The EfficientNetB0 architecture
enhances model efficiency by utilizing mobile inverted bottleneck blocks, which
incorporate depth wise separable convolutions. This design significantly
reduces the number of parameters and computational cost while preserving the
ability of models to learn complex feature representations. The ResNet50
architecture, pre trained on large scale datasets like ImageNet, is fine tuned
for brain tumor classification. Its use of residual connections allows for
training deeper networks by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and
avoiding performance degradation. The integration of these components ensures
that the proposed system is both computationally efficient and highly accurate.
Extensive experiments performed on publicly available MRI datasets demonstrate
that Deep Brain Net consistently outperforms existing state of the art methods
in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, and computational
efficiency. The result is an accuracy of 88 percent, a weighted F1 score of
88.75 percent, and a macro AUC ROC score of 98.17 percent which demonstrates
the robustness and clinical potential of Deep Brain Net in assisting
radiologists with brain tumor diagnosis.

Abstract: Multivariate Gaussian processes (GPs) offer a powerful probabilistic
framework to represent complex interdependent phenomena. They pose, however,
significant computational challenges in high-dimensional settings, which
frequently arise in spatial-temporal applications. We present DALIA, a highly

formulation of the GP, puts forward a GPU-accelerated block-dense approach, and
introduces a hierarchical, triple-layer, distributed memory parallel scheme. We
showcase weak scaling performance surpassing the state-of-the-art by two orders
of magnitude on a model whose parameter space is 8$\times$ larger and measure
strong scaling speedups of three orders of magnitude when running on 496 GH200
superchips on the Alps supercomputer. Applying DALIA to air pollution data from
northern Italy over 48 days, we showcase refined spatial resolutions over the

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的2阶段模型，用于在预布局阶段准确预测SRAM电路中的寄生效应，显著减少误差并加速仿真过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SRAM在SoC中常被定制以提高能效，但寄生效应导致预布局与后布局仿真差异大，设计迭代多，需解决这一问题。

Method: 结合图神经网络（GNN）分类器和多层感知机（MLP）回归器，使用Focal Loss处理类别不平衡，并集成子电路信息抽象层次结构。

Result: 在4个实际SRAM设计中，误差最大减少19倍，仿真速度提升高达598倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效预测寄生效应，显著提升设计效率和仿真速度。

Abstract: To achieve higher system energy efficiency, SRAM in SoCs is often customized.
The parasitic effects cause notable discrepancies between pre-layout and
post-layout circuit simulations, leading to difficulty in converging design
parameters and excessive design iterations. Is it possible to well predict the
parasitics based on the pre-layout circuit, so as to perform parasitic-aware
pre-layout simulation? In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based 2-stage
model to accurately predict these parasitics in pre-layout stages. The model
combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) classifier and Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) regressors, effectively managing class imbalance of the net parasitics in
SRAM circuits. We also employ Focal Loss to mitigate the impact of abundant
internal net samples and integrate subcircuit information into the graph to
abstract the hierarchical structure of schematics. Experiments on 4 real SRAM
designs show that our approach not only surpasses the state-of-the-art model in
parasitic prediction by a maximum of 19X reduction of error but also
significantly boosts the simulation process by up to 598X speedup.

Conclusion: FedPhD在联邦学习中高效训练扩散模型，显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed learning paradigm, trains models
over distributed clients' data. FL is particularly beneficial for distributed
training of Diffusion Models (DMs), which are high-quality image generators
that require diverse data. However, challenges such as high communication costs
and data heterogeneity persist in training DMs similar to training Transformers
and Convolutional Neural Networks. Limited research has addressed these issues
in FL environments. To address this gap and challenges, we introduce a novel
approach, FedPhD, designed to efficiently train DMs in FL environments. FedPhD
leverages Hierarchical FL with homogeneity-aware model aggregation and
selection policy to tackle data heterogeneity while reducing communication
costs. The distributed structured pruning of FedPhD enhances computational
efficiency and reduces model storage requirements in clients. Our experiments
across multiple datasets demonstrate that FedPhD achieves high model
performance regarding Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores while reducing
communication costs by up to $88\%$. FedPhD outperforms baseline methods
achieving at least a $34\%$ improvement in FID, while utilizing only $56\%$ of
the total computation and communication resources.

Result: 后期集中通信和最终全局合并能匹配服务器训练性能，低通信保持模型可合并性。

Conclusion: 去中心化学习在优化通信调度下可优于中心化训练，为模型合并和损失景观提供新见解。

Abstract: Decentralized learning provides a scalable alternative to traditional
parameter-server-based training, yet its performance is often hindered by
limited peer-to-peer communication. In this paper, we study how communication
should be scheduled over time, including determining when and how frequently
devices synchronize. Our empirical results show that concentrating
communication budgets in the later stages of decentralized training markedly
improves global generalization. Surprisingly, we uncover that fully connected
communication at the final step, implemented by a single global merging, is
sufficient to match the performance of server-based training. We further show
that low communication in decentralized learning preserves the
\textit{mergeability} of local models throughout training. Our theoretical
contributions, which explains these phenomena, are first to establish that the
globally merged model of decentralized SGD can converge faster than centralized
mini-batch SGD. Technically, we novelly reinterpret part of the discrepancy
among local models, which were previously considered as detrimental noise, as
constructive components that accelerate convergence. This work challenges the
common belief that decentralized learning generalizes poorly under data
heterogeneity and limited communication, while offering new insights into model
merging and neural network loss landscapes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种优化边缘网络中专家缓存的方法，以减少混合专家（MoE）模型的推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型在边缘设备上存储大量专家网络带来负担，需优化分布式推理的专家缓存以降低延迟。

Method: 针对Top-$K$专家选择策略，设计了贪婪算法和动态规划方法，并提出了基于最大卷积的加速算法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法显著降低了推理延迟，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了MoE模型在边缘网络中的专家缓存优化问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve the scalability of large language
models (LLMs) by activating only a small subset of relevant experts per input.
However, the sheer number of expert networks in an MoE model introduces a
significant storage burden for an edge device. To address this challenge, we
consider a scenario where experts are dispersed within an edge network for
distributed inference. Based on the popular Top-$K$ expert selection strategy,
we formulate a latency minimization problem by optimizing expert caching on
edge servers under storage constraints. When $K=1$, the problem reduces to a
monotone submodular maximization problem with knapsack constraints, for which
we design a greedy-based algorithm with a $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation guarantee.
For the general case where $K\geq1$, expert co-activation within the same MoE
layer introduces non-submodularity, causing greedy methods to be ineffective.
To tackle this issue, we propose a successive greedy decomposition method to
decompose the original problem into a series of subproblems, with each being
solved by a dynamic programming approach. Furthermore, we design an accelerated
algorithm based on the max-convolution technique to obtain the approximate
solution with a provable guarantee in polynomial time. Simulation results on
various MoE models demonstrate that our method significantly reduces inference
latency compared to existing baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DICE的方法，用于在去中心化网络中估计数据影响力的级联效应，解决了参与激励不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化学习虽能分散计算负载，但缺乏公平的激励机制，阻碍了广泛参与。

Method: 设计了DICE方法，通过数据、通信拓扑和损失景观曲率的相互作用来估计影响力级联。

Result: DICE提供了理论上的可处理近似，支持选择合适合作者和识别恶意行为。

Conclusion: DICE为去中心化网络中的公平激励机制奠定了基础。

Abstract: Decentralized learning offers a promising approach to crowdsource data
consumptions and computational workloads across geographically distributed
compute interconnected through peer-to-peer networks, accommodating the
exponentially increasing demands. However, proper incentives are still in
absence, considerably discouraging participation. Our vision is that a fair
incentive mechanism relies on fair attribution of contributions to
participating nodes, which faces non-trivial challenges arising from the
localized connections making influence ``cascade'' in a decentralized network.
To overcome this, we design the first method to estimate \textbf{D}ata
\textbf{I}nfluence \textbf{C}ascad\textbf{E} (DICE) in a decentralized
environment. Theoretically, the framework derives tractable approximations of
influence cascade over arbitrary neighbor hops, suggesting the influence
cascade is determined by an interplay of data, communication topology, and the
curvature of loss landscape. DICE also lays the foundations for applications
including selecting suitable collaborators and identifying malicious behaviors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了可解释性研究在预测模型对未见数据（OOD）行为方面的潜力与挑战，通过分析Transformer模型的注意力模式与OOD泛化的关系，发现简单的可解释性工具可以预测OOD性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索可解释性工具是否能预测模型在未见数据上的行为，填补现有研究对OOD行为预测的空白。

Method: 通过分析数百个独立训练的Transformer模型在合成分类任务中的注意力模式与OOD泛化的关系，进行相关性分析。

Result: 研究发现，当模型在分布内数据中表现出层次化注意力模式时，其在OOD数据上也倾向于层次化泛化，即使规则的实现不依赖这些模式。

Conclusion: 研究为可解释性工具预测未见模型行为提供了概念验证，激励进一步研究。

Abstract: Interpretability research often aims to predict how a model will respond to
targeted interventions on specific mechanisms. However, it rarely predicts how
a model will respond to unseen input data. This paper explores the promises and
challenges of interpretability as a tool for predicting out-of-distribution
(OOD) model behavior. Specifically, we investigate the correspondence between
attention patterns and OOD generalization in hundreds of Transformer models
independently trained on a synthetic classification task. These models exhibit
several distinct systematic generalization rules OOD, forming a diverse
population for correlational analysis. In this setting, we find that simple
observational tools from interpretability can predict OOD performance. In
particular, when in-distribution attention exhibits hierarchical patterns, the
model is likely to generalize hierarchically on OOD data -- even when the
rule's implementation does not rely on these hierarchical patterns, according
to ablation tests. Our findings offer a proof-of-concept to motivate further
interpretability work on predicting unseen model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于策略的强化学习方法（如PPO和GRPO）无法充分利用历史数据，导致计算和时间成本高昂，限制了经济高效的扩展。

Method: ReMix包含三个主要组件：混合策略近端策略梯度、KL凸策略约束和策略重生技术，以提高训练效率和稳定性。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，ReMix表现出色，平均Pass@1准确率显著提升，同时训练成本降低30至450倍。

Conclusion: ReMix通过高效利用非策略数据，实现了性能提升和成本降低的双重目标，为强化学习在大语言模型中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the
reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most
existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL
in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully
utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,
posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To
this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating
Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable
on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix
consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient
with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)
KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and
flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from
efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our
experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base
models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with
0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B
model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math
reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and
MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level
performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of
rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via
multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses
due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of
self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.

Motivation: 解决复杂神经网络存储大量权重的高内存需求问题。

Method: 使用PCA降维和轻量级SVR模型预测权重，结合敏感性分析压缩CNN低敏感性层。

Result: FC层压缩53倍，AlexNet在MNIST上压缩28倍，CIFAR-10上压缩18倍，精度损失1-2%。

Conclusion: WINGs显著降低内存需求，提升能效，适合资源受限的边缘应用。

Abstract: Complex neural networks require substantial memory to store a large number of
synaptic weights. This work introduces WINGs (Automatic Weight Generator for
Secure and Storage-Efficient Deep Learning Models), a novel framework that
dynamically generates layer weights in a fully connected neural network (FC)
and compresses the weights in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) during
inference, significantly reducing memory requirements without sacrificing
accuracy. WINGs framework uses principal component analysis (PCA) for
dimensionality reduction and lightweight support vector regression (SVR) models
to predict layer weights in the FC networks, removing the need for storing
full-weight matrices and achieving substantial memory savings. It also
preferentially compresses the weights in low-sensitivity layers of CNNs using
PCA and SVR with sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity-aware design also offers
an added level of security, as any bit-flip attack with weights in compressed
layers has an amplified and readily detectable effect on accuracy. WINGs
achieves 53x compression for the FC layers and 28x for AlexNet with MNIST
dataset, and 18x for Alexnet with CIFAR-10 dataset with 1-2% accuracy loss.
This significant reduction in memory results in higher throughput and lower
energy for DNN inference, making it attractive for resource-constrained edge
applications.

Result: 模型在解缠和生成质量上表现优异，支持无输入图像的样本生成，并实现潜在空间的平滑过渡。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效平衡了解缠与生成质量，为生成模型提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Disentangled and interpretable latent representations in generative models
typically come at the cost of generation quality. The $\beta$-VAE framework
introduces a hyperparameter $\beta$ to balance disentanglement and
reconstruction quality, where setting $\beta > 1$ introduces an information
bottleneck that favors disentanglement over sharp, accurate reconstructions. To
address this trade-off, we propose a novel generative modeling framework that
leverages a range of $\beta$ values to learn multiple corresponding latent
representations. First, we obtain a slew of representations by training a
single variational autoencoder (VAE), with a new loss function that controls
the information retained in each latent representation such that the higher
$\beta$ value prioritize disentanglement over reconstruction fidelity. We then,
introduce a non-linear diffusion model that smoothly transitions latent
representations corresponding to different $\beta$ values. This model denoises
towards less disentangled and more informative representations, ultimately
leading to (almost) lossless representations, enabling sharp reconstructions.
Furthermore, our model supports sample generation without input images,
functioning as a standalone generative model. We evaluate our framework in
terms of both disentanglement and generation quality. Additionally, we observe
smooth transitions in the latent spaces with respect to changes in $\beta$,
facilitating consistent manipulation of generated outputs.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新的损失函数MV-InfoNCE和MV-DHEL，解决了多视图对比学习中的四个关键问题，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多视图对比学习方法存在四个关键问题（如目标冲突、视图交互不足等），限制了多视图学习的潜力。

Method: 提出MV-InfoNCE和MV-DHEL两种损失函数，分别通过整合所有视图交互和解耦对齐与均匀性来优化多视图对比学习。

Result: 在ImageNet1K等数据集上表现优于现有方法，并能扩展到多模态数据。MV-DHEL在五视图以上时有效缓解维度崩溃。

Conclusion: 新方法在多视图对比学习中表现优异，尤其是MV-DHEL能够充分利用嵌入空间，实现监督学习中观察到的多视图优势。

Abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL), a leading paradigm in Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL), typically relies on pairs of data views generated through augmentation.
While multiple augmentations per instance (more than two) improve
generalization in supervised learning, current CL methods handle additional
views suboptimally by simply aggregating different pairwise objectives. This
approach suffers from four critical limitations: (L1) it utilizes multiple
optimization terms per data point resulting to conflicting objectives, (L2) it
fails to model all interactions across views and data points, (L3) it inherits
fundamental limitations (e.g. alignment-uniformity coupling) from pairwise CL
losses, and (L4) it prevents fully realizing the benefits of increased view
multiplicity observed in supervised settings. We address these limitations
through two novel loss functions: MV-InfoNCE, which extends InfoNCE to
incorporate all possible view interactions simultaneously in one term per data
point, and MV-DHEL, which decouples alignment from uniformity across views
while scaling interaction complexity with view multiplicity. Both approaches
are theoretically grounded - we prove they asymptotically optimize for
alignment of all views and uniformity, providing principled extensions to
multi-view contrastive learning. Our empirical results on ImageNet1K and three
other datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing
multi-view approaches and effectively scale with increasing view multiplicity.
We also apply our objectives to multimodal data and show that, in contrast to
other contrastive objectives, they can scale beyond just two modalities. Most
significantly, ablation studies reveal that MV-DHEL with five or more views
effectively mitigates dimensionality collapse by fully utilizing the embedding
space, thereby delivering multi-view benefits observed in supervised learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域增量学习（DIL）在非平稳环境中面临域内类不平衡和跨域类分布偏移的挑战，导致模型性能下降。

Method: DCE框架通过频率感知专家组和动态专家选择器，分别解决域内类不平衡和跨域分布偏移问题。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，DCE实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DCE框架有效解决了DIL中的类不平衡问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL) focuses on continual learning in
non-stationary environments, requiring models to adjust to evolving domains
while preserving historical knowledge. DIL faces two critical challenges in the
context of imbalanced data: intra-domain class imbalance and cross-domain class
distribution shifts. These challenges significantly hinder model performance,
as intra-domain imbalance leads to underfitting of few-shot classes, while
cross-domain shifts require maintaining well-learned many-shot classes and
transferring knowledge to improve few-shot class performance in old domains. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts
(DCE) framework. DCE employs a frequency-aware expert group, where each expert
is guided by specialized loss functions to learn features for specific
frequency groups, effectively addressing intra-domain class imbalance.
Subsequently, a dynamic expert selector is learned by synthesizing
pseudo-features through balanced Gaussian sampling from historical class
statistics. This mechanism navigates the trade-off between preserving many-shot
knowledge of previous domains and leveraging new data to improve few-shot class
performance in earlier tasks. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark
datasets demonstrate DCE's state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Despite large-scale pretraining endowing models with language and vision
reasoning capabilities, improving their spatial reasoning capability remains
challenging due to the lack of data grounded in the 3D world. While it is
possible for humans to manually create immersive and interactive worlds through
3D graphics, as seen in applications such as VR, gaming, and robotics, this
process remains highly labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a scalable
method for generating high-quality 3D environments that can serve as training
data for foundation models. We recast 3D environment building as a sequential
decision-making problem, employing Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) as policies
that output actions to jointly craft a 3D environment's layout, materials,
lighting, and assets. Our proposed framework, 3D-Generalist, trains VLMs to
generate more prompt-aligned 3D environments via self-improvement fine-tuning.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Generalist and the proposed training
strategy in generating simulation-ready 3D environments. Furthermore, we
demonstrate its quality and scalability in synthetic data generation by
pretraining a vision foundation model on the generated data. After fine-tuning
the pre-trained model on downstream tasks, we show that it surpasses models
pre-trained on meticulously human-crafted synthetic data and approaches results
achieved with real data orders of magnitude larger.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合网格表示与3D高斯泼溅的新框架，以增强非刚性3D模型变形能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯泼溅虽能快速实时渲染辐射场，但对后编辑和大规模非刚性变形的支持有限。

Method: 将高斯核直接嵌入显式网格表面，利用网格的拓扑和几何先验指导编辑操作。

Result: 实现了直观的编辑操作（如移动、缩放、旋转）和复杂变形（如弯曲、拉伸）。

Conclusion: 为虚拟现实、角色动画等领域的3D内容创作提供了更灵活的工作流。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that enhances non-rigid 3D model deformations by
bridging mesh representations with 3D Gaussian splatting. While traditional
Gaussian splatting delivers fast, real-time radiance-field rendering, its
post-editing capabilities and support for large-scale, non-rigid deformations
remain limited. Our method addresses these challenges by embedding Gaussian
kernels directly onto explicit mesh surfaces. This allows the mesh's inherent
topological and geometric priors to guide intuitive editing operations -- such
as moving, scaling, and rotating individual 3D components -- and enables
complex deformations like bending and stretching. This work paves the way for
more flexible 3D content-creation workflows in applications spanning virtual
reality, character animation, and interactive design.

TL;DR: DeepRetro是一个结合模板和LLM的迭代逆合成框架，通过动态路径探索和反馈驱动循环，成功识别新颖的逆合成路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆合成方法受限于预定义模板，难以发现新路径；LLM虽有望解决此问题，但其多步规划能力尚未充分开发。

Method: 结合模板引擎和LLM，通过反馈驱动循环逐步优化路径，并进行严格验证。

Result: 在基准测试和案例研究中，DeepRetro成功识别可行且新颖的逆合成路径。

Conclusion: 迭代LLM推理结合人类反馈，有望推动复杂化学合成的前沿发展。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the identification of precursor molecules for a target
compound, is pivotal for synthesizing complex molecules, but faces challenges
in discovering novel pathways beyond predefined templates. Recent large
language model (LLM) approaches to retrosynthesis have shown promise but
effectively harnessing LLM reasoning capabilities for effective multi-step
planning remains an open question. To address this challenge, we introduce
DeepRetro, an open-source, iterative, hybrid LLM-based retrosynthetic
framework. Our approach integrates the strengths of conventional
template-based/Monte Carlo tree search tools with the generative power of LLMs
in a step-wise, feedback-driven loop. Initially, synthesis planning is
attempted with a template-based engine. If this fails, the LLM subsequently
proposes single-step retrosynthetic disconnections. Crucially, these
suggestions undergo rigorous validity, stability, and hallucination checks
before the resulting precursors are recursively fed back into the pipeline for
further evaluation. This iterative refinement allows for dynamic pathway
exploration and correction. We demonstrate the potential of this pipeline
through benchmark evaluations and case studies, showcasing its ability to
identify viable and potentially novel retrosynthetic routes. In particular, we
develop an interactive graphical user interface that allows expert human
chemists to provide human-in-the-loop feedback to the reasoning algorithm. This
approach successfully generates novel pathways for complex natural product
compounds, demonstrating the potential for iterative LLM reasoning to advance
state-of-art in complex chemical syntheses.

Motivation: 现有的病理基础模型缺乏与单细胞分子数据的整合，限制了其在精准肿瘤学中的应用。

Method: PAST通过联合编码细胞形态和基因表达，学习统一的跨模态表征，支持单细胞基因表达预测、虚拟分子染色和多模态生存分析。

Result: PAST在多种癌症和下游任务中表现优于现有方法，展现了强大的泛化能力和可扩展性。

Conclusion: PAST为病理基础模型提供了新范式，支持高分辨率空间组学、机制发现和精准癌症研究。

Abstract: While pathology foundation models have transformed cancer image analysis,
they often lack integration with molecular data at single-cell resolution,
limiting their utility for precision oncology. Here, we present PAST, a
pan-cancer single-cell foundation model trained on 20 million paired
histopathology images and single-cell transcriptomes spanning multiple tumor
types and tissue contexts. By jointly encoding cellular morphology and gene
expression, PAST learns unified cross-modal representations that capture both
spatial and molecular heterogeneity at the cellular level. This approach
enables accurate prediction of single-cell gene expression, virtual molecular
staining, and multimodal survival analysis directly from routine pathology
slides. Across diverse cancers and downstream tasks, PAST consistently exceeds
the performance of existing approaches, demonstrating robust generalizability
and scalability. Our work establishes a new paradigm for pathology foundation
models, providing a versatile tool for high-resolution spatial omics,
mechanistic discovery, and precision cancer research.

Motivation: 评估人形机器人性能具有挑战性，传统成功率指标难以复现且无法捕捉轨迹复杂性。

Method: 设计了NeME（神经元评估器），通过深度学习模型从关节轨迹中分类动作，作为元评估器比较控制策略性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比基线更符合机器人实际成功率，提供了可复现、系统化的评估手段。

Conclusion: NeME为复杂人机交互任务中的多模态模仿学习方法提供了有效的性能比较工具。

Abstract: Evaluating and comparing the performance of autonomous Humanoid Robots is
challenging, as success rate metrics are difficult to reproduce and fail to
capture the complexity of robot movement trajectories, critical in Human-Robot
Interaction and Collaboration (HRIC). To address these challenges, we propose a
general evaluation framework that measures the quality of Imitation Learning
(IL) methods by focusing on trajectory performance. We devise the Neural Meta
Evaluator (NeME), a deep learning model trained to classify actions from robot
joint trajectories. NeME serves as a meta-evaluator to compare the performance
of robot control policies, enabling policy evaluation without requiring human
involvement in the loop. We validate our framework on ergoCub, a humanoid
robot, using teleoperation data and comparing IL methods tailored to the
available platform. The experimental results indicate that our method is more
aligned with the success rate obtained on the robot than baselines, offering a
reproducible, systematic, and insightful means for comparing the performance of
multimodal imitation learning approaches in complex HRI tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在开放世界环境中执行长距离导航任务时难以整合物体检测和高级任务规划的挑战。

Method: 整合LLMs进行分层任务规划，结合开放词汇视觉检测模型，并设计专用解决方案（如拉普拉斯方差滤波）应对视觉抖动等问题。

Result: 成功完成涉及实时检测、搜索和导航的长序列任务，并在不同腿式机器人上验证了兼容性和即插即用特性。

Conclusion: LOVON在动态非结构化环境中表现出色，具备自主导航、任务适应和鲁棒任务完成能力。

Abstract: Object navigation in open-world environments remains a formidable and
pervasive challenge for robotic systems, particularly when it comes to
executing long-horizon tasks that require both open-world object detection and
high-level task planning. Traditional methods often struggle to integrate these
components effectively, and this limits their capability to deal with complex,
long-range navigation missions. In this paper, we propose LOVON, a novel
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for hierarchical task
planning with open-vocabulary visual detection models, tailored for effective
long-range object navigation in dynamic, unstructured environments. To tackle
real-world challenges including visual jittering, blind zones, and temporary
target loss, we design dedicated solutions such as Laplacian Variance Filtering
for visual stabilization. We also develop a functional execution logic for the
robot that guarantees LOVON's capabilities in autonomous navigation, task
adaptation, and robust task completion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the
successful completion of long-sequence tasks involving real-time detection,
search, and navigation toward open-vocabulary dynamic targets. Furthermore,
real-world experiments across different legged robots (Unitree Go2, B2, and
H1-2) showcase the compatibility and appealing plug-and-play feature of LOVON.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的分类问题（如植物识别）常具有长尾分布，现有方法无法同时保证类别覆盖率和预测集大小。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）基于宏覆盖率的prevalence-adjusted softmax；2）标签加权方法，平衡边际和类别条件预测。

Result: 在Pl@ntNet和iNaturalist数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 新方法在长尾分布分类中实现了覆盖率和预测集大小的平衡。

Abstract: Many real-world classification problems, such as plant identification, have
extremely long-tailed class distributions. In order for prediction sets to be
useful in such settings, they should (i) provide good class-conditional
coverage, ensuring that rare classes are not systematically omitted from the
prediction sets, and (ii) be a reasonable size, allowing users to easily verify
candidate labels. Unfortunately, existing conformal prediction methods, when
applied to the long-tailed setting, force practitioners to make a binary choice
between small sets with poor class-conditional coverage or sets with very good
class-conditional coverage but that are extremely large. We propose methods
with guaranteed marginal coverage that smoothly trade off between set size and
class-conditional coverage. First, we propose a conformal score function,
prevalence-adjusted softmax, that targets a relaxed notion of class-conditional
coverage called macro-coverage. Second, we propose a label-weighted conformal
prediction method that allows us to interpolate between marginal and
class-conditional conformal prediction. We demonstrate our methods on Pl@ntNet
and iNaturalist, two long-tailed image datasets with 1,081 and 8,142 classes,
respectively.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的存储抽象模型MQSSD，旨在更准确地反映现代存储硬件的性能特征，并通过实验验证其在优化LSM树存储引擎中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有存储性能模型（如DAM模型）在现代存储技术（如多队列SSD）中准确性和实用性下降，需要更精确的抽象模型来优化存储算法和数据结构设计。

Method: 提出MQSSD模型，基于现代多队列SSD的关键性能特征，并通过实验验证其在LSM树存储引擎（如RocksDB）中的应用效果。

Result: MQSSD模型能更准确地抽象现代硬件性能，支持并发访问优化，实验证明其可显著提升存储引擎性能。

Conclusion: MQSSD模型比传统模型更准确，为现代存储硬件的优化设计提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding the performance profiles of storage devices and how best to
utilize them has always been non-trivial due to factors such as seek times,
caching, scheduling, concurrent access, flash wear-out, and garbage collection.
However, analytical frameworks that provide simplified abstractions of storage
performance can still be accurate enough to evaluate external memory algorithms
and data structures at the design stage. For example, the Disk Access Machine
(DAM) model assumes that a storage device transfers data in fixed-size blocks
of size B and that all transfers have unit latency. This abstraction is already
sufficient to explain some of the benefits of data structures such as B-trees
and Log-Structured Merge trees (LSM trees); however, storage technology
advances have significantly reduced current models' accuracy and utility.
  This paper introduces the Multi-Queue Solid State Drive (MQSSD) model, a new
storage abstraction. This model builds upon previous models and aims to more
accurately represent the performance characteristics of modern storage
hardware. We identify key performance-critical aspects of modern multi-queue
solid-state drives on which we base our model and demonstrate these
characteristics on actual hardware. We then show how our model can be applied
to LSM-tree-based storage engines to optimize them for modern storage hardware.
We highlight that leveraging concurrent access is crucial for fully utilizing
the high throughput of multi-queue SSDs, enabling designs that may appear
counterintuitive under traditional paradigms We then validate these insights
through experiments using Facebook's LSM-tree-based key-value store, RocksDB.
We conclude that the MQSSD model offers a more accurate abstraction of modern
hardware than previous models, allowing for greater insight and optimization.

Motivation: 现有研究多聚焦于视觉可爱性，而声音可爱性的科学尚未系统化，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过四阶段实验（N=512），分析文本转语音（TTS）和游戏角色声音的基频与共振峰频率对可爱感知的影响。

Result: 发现某些声音在特定频率调整下存在可爱“甜点”，但存在天花板效应。

Conclusion: 初步验证了声音可爱性模型，并提供了操控计算机声音可爱感知的基本方法。

Abstract: "Kawaii" is the Japanese concept of cute, which carries sociocultural
connotations related to social identities and emotional responses. Yet,
virtually all work to date has focused on the visual side of kawaii, including
in studies of computer agents and social robots. In pursuit of formalizing the
new science of kawaii vocalics, we explored what elements of voice relate to
kawaii and how they might be manipulated, manually and automatically. We
conducted a four-phase study (grand N = 512) with two varieties of computer
voices: text-to-speech (TTS) and game character voices. We found kawaii "sweet
spots" through manipulation of fundamental and formant frequencies, but only
for certain voices and to a certain extent. Findings also suggest a ceiling
effect for the kawaii vocalics of certain voices. We offer empirical validation
of the preliminary kawaii vocalics model and an elementary method for
manipulating kawaii perceptions of computer voice.

Abstract: This study investigates how stylized, voiced agents shape user interaction in
a multimodal language learning environment. We conducted a mixed-methods
evaluation of 54 participants interacting with anime-inspired characters
powered by large language models and expressive text-to-speech synthesis. These
agents responded in Japanese character language, offering users asynchronous,
semi-structured conversation in varying speech styles and emotional tones. We
analyzed user engagement patterns, perceived usability, emotional responses,
and learning behaviors, with particular attention to how agent stylization
influenced interaction across language proficiency levels and cultural
backgrounds. Our findings reveal that agent design, especially voice, persona,
and linguistic style, substantially affected user experience, motivation, and
strategy. This work contributes to the understanding of affective, culturally
stylized agents in human-agent interaction and offers guidance for designing
more engaging, socially responsive systems.

Method: 与CSO合作开发AI辅助的开源工具，监测Telegram上的反民主运动内容。

Result: 目前为进行中的工作，旨在促进CSOs与技术开发者的合作。

Conclusion: CSOs应作为技术开发的积极参与者，而非被动消费者，以确保工具符合实际需求。

Abstract: The role of civil society organizations (CSOs) in monitoring harmful online
content is increasingly crucial, especially as platform providers reduce their
investment in content moderation. AI tools can assist in detecting and
monitoring harmful content at scale. However, few open-source tools offer
seamless integration of AI models and social media monitoring infrastructures.
Given their thematic expertise and contextual understanding of harmful content,
CSOs should be active partners in co-developing technological tools, providing
feedback, helping to improve models, and ensuring alignment with stakeholder
needs and values, rather than as passive 'consumers'. However, collaborations
between the open source community, academia, and civil society remain rare, and
research on harmful content seldom translates into practical tools usable by
civil society actors. This work in progress explores how CSOs can be
meaningfully involved in an AI-assisted open-source monitoring tool of
anti-democratic movements on Telegram, which we are currently developing in
collaboration with CSO stakeholders.

Result: 在波兰语和印尼语实验中，仅需10分钟音素监督，错误率降低5%；在跨域文本数据适应中，错误率降低9%。

Conclusion: JSA-SPG方法有效且高效，开源代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained models with phonetic supervision have demonstrated
their advantages for crosslingual speech recognition in data efficiency and
information sharing across languages. However, a limitation is that a
pronunciation lexicon is needed for such phoneme-based crosslingual speech
recognition. In this study, we aim to eliminate the need for pronunciation
lexicons and propose a latent variable model based method, with phonemes being
treated as discrete latent variables. The new method consists of a
speech-to-phoneme (S2P) model and a phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G) model, and a
grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model is introduced as an auxiliary inference model.
To jointly train the three models, we utilize the joint stochastic
approximation (JSA) algorithm, which is a stochastic extension of the EM
(expectation-maximization) algorithm and has demonstrated superior performance
particularly in estimating discrete latent variable models. Based on the
Whistle multilingual pre-trained S2P model, crosslingual experiments are
conducted in Polish (130 h) and Indonesian (20 h). With only 10 minutes of
phoneme supervision, the new method, JSA-SPG, achieves 5\% error rate
reductions compared to the best crosslingual fine-tuning approach using subword
or full phoneme supervision. Furthermore, it is found that in language domain
adaptation (i.e., utilizing cross-domain text-only data), JSA-SPG outperforms
the standard practice of language model fusion via the auxiliary support of the
G2P model by 9% error rate reductions. To facilitate reproducibility and
encourage further exploration in this field, we open-source the JSA-SPG
training code and complete pipeline.

Result: 构建了包含约150万指令的高质量数据集，实验证明其在提升指令跟随能力上有效。

Conclusion: 该工作为指令数据集从数量扩张到质量提升提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a foundation for unlocking the capabilities of
large-scale pretrained models and improving their performance on complex tasks.
Thus, the construction of high-quality instruction datasets is crucial for
enhancing model performance and generalizability. Although current instruction
datasets have reached tens of millions of samples, models finetuned on them may
still struggle with complex instruction following and tasks in rare domains.
This is primarily due to limited expansion in both ``coverage'' (coverage of
task types and knowledge areas) and ``depth'' (instruction complexity) of the
instruction set. To address this issue, we propose a systematic instruction
data construction framework, which integrates a hierarchical labeling system,
an informative seed selection algorithm, an evolutionary data synthesis
process, and a model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation. These
components form an iterative closed-loop to continuously enhance the coverage
and depth of instruction data. Based on this framework, we construct
InfinityInstruct-Subject, a high-quality dataset containing ~1.5 million
instructions. Experiments on multiple foundation models and benchmark tasks
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving instruction-following capabilities.
Further analyses suggest that InfinityInstruct-Subject shows enlarged coverage
and depth compared to comparable synthesized instruction datasets. Our work
lays a theoretical and practical foundation for the efficient, continuous
evolution of instruction datasets, moving from data quantity expansion to
qualitative improvement.

Abstract: Traditional travel-planning systems are often static and fragmented, leaving
them ill-equipped to handle real-world complexities such as evolving
environmental conditions and unexpected itinerary disruptions. In this paper,
we identify three gaps between existing service providers causing frustrating
user experience: intelligent trip planning, precision "last-100-meter"
navigation, and dynamic itinerary adaptation. We propose three cooperative
agents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and
map analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination
Assistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation
leg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image
embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to
trip plan disruptions. With evaluations and experiments, our system
demonstrates substantial improvements in query interpretation, navigation
accuracy, and disruption resilience, underscoring its promise for applications
from urban exploration to emergency response.
