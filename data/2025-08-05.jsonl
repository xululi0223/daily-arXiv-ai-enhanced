Speculative address translation can hide this latency by predicting\nthe physical address (PA) of requested data early in the pipeline. However,\npredicting the PA from the virtual address (VA) is difficult due to the\nunpredictability of VA-to-PA mappings in conventional OSes. Prior works try to\novercome this but face two key issues: (i) reliance on large pages or VA-to-PA\ncontiguity, which is not guaranteed, and (ii) costly hardware changes to store\nspeculation metadata with limited effectiveness.\n  We introduce Revelator, a hardware-OS cooperative scheme enabling highly\naccurate speculative address translation with minimal modifications.

On a\nTLB miss, a lightweight speculation engine, guided by this policy, generates\ncandidate PAs for both program data and last-level page table entries (PTEs).\nThus, Revelator (i) speculatively fetches requested data before translation\nresolves, reducing access latency, and (ii) fetches the fourth-level PTE before\nthe third-level PTE is accessed, accelerating page table walks.\n  We prototype Revelator's OS support in Linux and evaluate it in simulation\nacross 11 diverse, data-intensive benchmarks in native and virtualized\nenvironments.

In this paper, we present ReGate, which enables\nfine-grained power-gating of each hardware component in NPU chips with\nhardware/software co-design. Unlike conventional power-gating techniques for\ngeneric processors, enabling power-gating in NPUs faces unique challenges due\nto the fundamental difference in hardware architecture and program execution\nmodel. To address these challenges, we carefully investigate the power-gating\nopportunities in each component of NPU chips and decide the best-fit power\nmanagement scheme (i.e., hardware- vs. software-managed power gating).\nSpecifically, for systolic arrays (SAs) that have deterministic execution\npatterns, ReGate enables cycle-level power gating at the granularity of\nprocessing elements (PEs) following the inherent dataflow execution in SAs. For\ninter-chip interconnect (ICI) and HBM controllers that have long idle\nintervals, ReGate employs a lightweight hardware-based idle-detection\nmechanism.

Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in\nimage quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more\ncategories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a\ntext-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity,\nand aesthetic quality.

However, its reliance on a centralized server leads to\nlimited scalability. Decentralized federated learning (DFL) eliminates the\ndependency on a centralized server by enabling peer-to-peer model exchange.\nExisting DFL mechanisms mainly employ synchronous communication, which may\nresult in training inefficiencies under heterogeneous and dynamic edge\nenvironments. Although a few recent asynchronous DFL (ADFL) mechanisms have\nbeen proposed to address these issues, they typically yield stale model\naggregation and frequent model transmission, leading to degraded training\nperformance on non-IID data and high communication overhead. To overcome these\nissues, we present DySTop, an innovative mechanism that jointly optimizes\ndynamic staleness control and topology construction in ADFL. In each round,\nmultiple workers are activated, and a subset of their neighbors is selected to\ntransmit models for aggregation, followed by local training. We provide a\nrigorous convergence analysis for DySTop, theoretically revealing the\nquantitative relationships between the convergence bound and key factors such\nas maximum staleness, activating frequency, and data distribution among\nworkers. From the insights of the analysis, we propose a worker activation\nalgorithm (WAA) for staleness control and a phase-aware topology construction\nalgorithm (PTCA) to reduce communication overhead and handle data non-IID.\nExtensive evaluations through both large-scale simulations and real-world\ntestbed experiments demonstrate that our DySTop reduces completion time by\n51.8% and the communication resource consumption by 57.1% compared to\nstate-of-the-art solutions, while maintaining the same model accuracy."}

Project Website: https://cupid.kixlab.org/", "summary": "Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) often assumes users hold\nstatic preferences that reflect globally in all tasks. In reality, humans hold\ndynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact\nwith an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual\npreferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure\nalignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated\ninteraction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In\neach interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and\nexpresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user\nrequest and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can\ninfer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that\nsatisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary\nLLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from\nmulti-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant\nto a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage\nRefined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives\nwithin a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main\ninnovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature\nre-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during\nboth the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the\nTraining mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating\npedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby\nconstructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.\nDuring the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the\nClassifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into\nthe proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through\npedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm\nvertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region\nproposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,\nfiltering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a\nresult, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress\npedestrian false positives across all stages.

This task poses significant challenges due to\ncomplex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly\ndeformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single\nmodel to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse\namodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to\nadopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different\nshape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's\nunderlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and\ninsufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized\nexperts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific\nsparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to\nlearn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a\nlightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically,\nShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures\nkey shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to\nthe most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert\nrouting. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting\noccluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well\ninterpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining\nhigh capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show\nthat ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in\noccluded region segmentation. The code will be released."}

However, event networks\nheavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution\nand spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing\narchitectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event\nrepresentation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse\ntasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous\nmethods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T\nscaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the\nlocal feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial\nand temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are\napplied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute\nefficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to\nlearn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which\nenables standard vision models to process event data without architecture\nchange. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent\nout-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks\nand 10 datasets (Fig.1).

However, through an\nin-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a\npreviously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information\nbut also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality\nbias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both\nvisual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of\nuser-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet\neffective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination.

In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled\nBackdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured\ndisentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor\nthreats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image\nrepresentations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in\nthe embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs).

Recent work\nmodifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated\nimages by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.\nThis enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,\ngenerally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two\ncommon issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate\nimages that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches\nneglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.\nSpecifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired\nconditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve\nthis, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired\nconditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image\nprompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention\nmodifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image\nand alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and\nvalues from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the\ngenerated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new\nself-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys\nand values from both images rather than selecting between them.

However, through an\nin-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a\npreviously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information\nbut also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality\nbias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both\nvisual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of\nuser-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet\neffective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we\nintervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,\nbalancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.\nFurthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's\noverreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our\nattention manipulation.
