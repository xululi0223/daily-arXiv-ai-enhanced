We\nrigorously analyze SiMRA's true random generation potential in terms of\nentropy, latency, and throughput for varying numbers of simultaneously\nactivated DRAM rows (i.e., 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32), data patterns, temperature\nlevels, and spatial variations. Among our 11 key experimental observations, we\nhighlight four key results. First, we evaluate the quality of our TRNG designs\nusing the commonly-used NIST statistical test suite for randomness and find\nthat all SiMRA-based TRNG designs successfully pass each test. Second, 2-, 8-,\n16-, and 32-row activation-based TRNG designs outperform the state-of-theart\nDRAM-based TRNG in throughput by up to 1.15x, 1.99x, 1.82x, and 1.39x,\nrespectively. Third, SiMRA's entropy tends to increase with the number of\nsimultaneously activated DRAM rows. Fourth, operational parameters and\nconditions (e.g., data pattern and temperature) significantly affect entropy.\nFor example, for most of the tested modules, the average entropy of 32-row\nactivation is 2.51x higher than that of 2-row activation.

However, a\npersistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations\nhave not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this\npaper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what\nprinciples give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental\ninsights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research\n(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \\textit{Adaptive routing}:\nSA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic\ncontent, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.\n(2) \\textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token\nweighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,\nwhereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable\nredundancy. Based on this, we propose \\textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),\na principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically\ninjects these principles.

For that purpose\nthis paper presents a real-time currency detection system designed to assist\nvisually impaired individuals. The proposed model is trained on a dataset\ncontaining 30 classes of notes and coins, representing 3 types of currency: US\ndollar (USD), Euro (EUR), and Bangladeshi taka (BDT). Our approach uses a\nYOLOv8 nano model with a custom detection head featuring deep convolutional\nlayers and Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks to enhance feature extraction and\ndetection accuracy.

While MBR has proven effective in machine\ntranslation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is\nnaturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as\ndialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,\napplying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in\nselecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's\ndistribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of\ngenerations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we\nintroduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to\nmake MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test\nour hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of\nlatent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a\nsentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate\nthe structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common\nsimilarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,\nour proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality.

With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content\navailable online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring\ncontent authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works\nassessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark\nforging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and\napplied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we\ninvestigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image\nwatermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a\npreference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is\ntrained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without\nany need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to\nremove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through\nbackpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and\nworks without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much\nsimpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we\nevaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking\nmodels, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,\nquestioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and\nfurther resources are publicly available."}

This, in turn, poses a challenge for\ndeep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a\nbiologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most\nexciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and\nadversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nreconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual\ncortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded\nneurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers\nof the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can\nreconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500\nneurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified\nbenchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results\ndemonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and\nprovide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications."}

Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each\nrequiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid\ndeployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)\nOnly a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --\neliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's\nsingular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the\nfactorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple\nsubspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces\noverfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to\n24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just\n100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the\nindicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to\nfurther reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream\ntasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show\nthat combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for\ndownstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a\nquick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can\nadapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning."}
