Supervisors: Philipp Jovanovic and Alberto Sonnino", "summary": "Users of blockchains value scalability, expecting fast confirmations and\nimmediate transaction processing. Odontoceti, the latest in DAG-based\nconsensus, addresses these concerns by prioritizing low latency and high\nthroughput, making a strategic trade-off in security by operating with a 20%\nfault tolerance instead of the established 33% level. It is the first DAG-based\nprotocol to achieve commitment in just two communication rounds, delivering\nmedian latency of 300 milliseconds while processing 10,000 transactions per\nsecond under realistic network conditions. Odontoceti operates with n = 5f + 1\nvalidators and creates an uncertified DAG with a novel decision rule for\ncommitting blocks. The protocol includes an optimization that advances progress\nwhen participants are slow, benefiting crash fault scenarios which are more\ncommon in practice than Byzantine faults. Evaluation results demonstrate 20-25%\nlatency improvements compared to an existing production protocol, validating\nthat reducing wave length from three rounds to two rounds yields meaningful\nperformance benefits. This paper establishes the practical viability of lower\nfault tolerance consensus protocols for blockchains."}

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal\nfine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes\ncontext labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the\nembedding and generator models is required."}

Traditional field observations are often limited in scope,\ntime-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral\nresponses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan\nAnimal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated\nmulti-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based\nvideo with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial\nmetrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection,\ntracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics,\nincluding time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat\nassociations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods,\ndrone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity,\nreducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher\naccuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies,\nanalyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional\nmethods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras,\nvigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains\nzebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit\nstrong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and\nobserved spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and\ngiraffes in mixed-species herds.

However, their reliance on transformer\narchitectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when\nextending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive\nformulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from\nshort-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models\ncannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their\ntraining horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from\nthe compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we\npropose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in\nlong-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video\nteachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on\nexploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the\nstudent model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.\nOur method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to\n20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure\nand error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous\nmethods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of\ngenerating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the\nmaximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x\nlonger than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and\nour proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially\noutperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency.

We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with\nSelf-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of\ngold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to\nspurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire\nanswer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency\nexamples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization\nmechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,\nenabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging\nreasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.\nWith Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to\n+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on\nGPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.\nThese results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward\nstronger reasoning without gold labels."}

In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to\ndiagnose reasoning-execution gaps.

By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)\nmetric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.\nThis joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)\nExecution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action\nbut execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but\nreasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results\nacross a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution\ngaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than\nreasoning gaps.

This raises a crucial question:\n$\\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively\ntransfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating\nEnglish-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a\nmetric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that\ncross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target\nlanguage, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that\nmodels with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on\nEnglish-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.\nTo address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental\nresults yield three key findings: $\\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial\nleap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single\nparallel language, and a predictable $\\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing\nthat cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of\ntraining parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between\nactual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as\n$\\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs\nfail to fully generalize across languages.

To address this, we\nintroduce a new benchmark of over 49,000 odd-one-out similarity judgments on\n250 three-second video clips of social interactions, and discover a modality\ngap: despite the task being visual, caption-based language embeddings align\nbetter with human similarity than any pretrained video model. We close this gap\nby fine-tuning a TimeSformer video model on these human judgments with our\nnovel hybrid triplet-RSA objective using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), aligning\npairwise distances to human similarity. This fine-tuning protocol yields\nsignificantly improved alignment with human perceptions on held-out videos in\nterms of both explained variance and odd-one-out triplet accuracy. Variance\npartitioning shows that the fine-tuned video model increases shared variance\nwith language embeddings and explains additional unique variance not captured\nby the language model. Finally, we test transfer via linear probes and find\nthat human-similarity fine-tuning strengthens the encoding of social-affective\nattributes (intimacy, valence, dominance, communication) relative to the\npretrained baseline.

In this paper, we present\nRLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the\ncore spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of\npretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory\naction, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for\npredicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the\nmodel to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an\nindependent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the\nreward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when\nconditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to\nconditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense\nreward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream\nduring pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for\nreasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between\nnext-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.\nPretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an\neight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%.

Similarly, decoding-based methods have quantified semantic features\nfrom neural populations but have not uncovered their underlying organizations.\nThis leaves open a scientific question: \"how feature-specific visual\ninformation is distributed across neural populations in higher visual areas,\nand whether it is organized into structured, semantically meaningful\nsubspaces.\" To tackle this problem, we present MIG-Vis, a method that leverages\nthe generative power of diffusion models to visualize and validate the\nvisual-semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces. Our method first\nuses a variational autoencoder to infer a group-wise disentangled neural latent\nsubspace from neural populations. Subsequently, we propose a mutual information\n(MI)-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the specific\nvisual-semantic features encoded by each latent group. We validate MIG-Vis on\nmulti-session neural spiking datasets from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of\ntwo macaques. The synthesized results demonstrate that our method identifies\nneural latent groups with clear semantic selectivity to diverse visual\nfeatures, including object pose, inter-category transformations, and\nintra-class content. These findings provide direct, interpretable evidence of\nstructured semantic representation in the higher visual cortex and advance our\nunderstanding of its encoding principles."}

Existing approaches that discover\nsafety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or\nemploy automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack\ndata, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not\nexplore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider\nnovel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and\nstrategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent\nfindings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn\nattacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy\nreinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously\ndiscovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a\nsequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without\nmanually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only\nachieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to\nprevious state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack\nstrategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success\nacross multiple turns."}

In this paper, we introduce\nInteractive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,\nfeedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or\nautomated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to\nmediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,\nallowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,\nand model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that\nInteractive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity\nto initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,\npaving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously\nmonitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training\ndynamics."}
