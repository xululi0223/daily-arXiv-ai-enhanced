Prior work has\nexplored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can\nimprove downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such\napproaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the\nmodel used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a\nnovel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning\nability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping\nenvironments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation\ntask into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided\nby distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal\nmodel signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a\nself-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward\nstructure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable\nfine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action\ntypes and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and\nvalues), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty.

Although\nresearch into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be\nhindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.\nDisparate datasets and metrics used across studies complicate reproducibility,\nmaking it difficult to fairly assess and compare the effectiveness of various\napproaches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Visual Bias\nMitigator (VB-Mitigator), an open-source framework designed to streamline the\ndevelopment, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation\ntechniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12\nestablished mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of\nVB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of\nadditional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to\naccelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as\na foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their\napproaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and\nprovide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art\nmethodologies."}

In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel\nframework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by\ncombining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,\nMVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and\nspatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for\ndownstream 3D and 4D reconstruction.

We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited\nto ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail\nwhile effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.\nSimilar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is\nwell-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small\nmedical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and\nabsence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we\npropose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT\nrepresentations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our\nauxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various\nfrozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\\% using 100\\% and up to\n8.35\\% using only 10\\% of the training data."}

However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded\nLayer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the\nquantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively\nreducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when\nquantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%\nimprovement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to\nstate-of-the-art techniques."}

While\nexisting methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable\nprogress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail\nto leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we\npropose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework\nfeaturing an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses\nprediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding\nupdate mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units\nper sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential\nhistorical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into\nclean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and\ndual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's\nconvergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and\nreal-world benchmarks."}

However, efficient inverse\nrendering with MVPS remains challenging. To fill this gap, we introduce the\nGaussian Splatting for Multi-view Photometric Stereo (PS-GS), which efficiently\nand jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lighting of the object that\nis illuminated by diverse directional lights (multi-light). Our method first\nreconstructs a standard 2D Gaussian splatting model as the initial geometry.\nBased on the initialization model, it then proceeds with the deferred inverse\nrendering by the full rendering equation containing a lighting-computing\nmulti-layer perceptron. During the whole optimization, we regularize the\nrendered normal maps by the uncalibrated photometric stereo estimated normals.\nWe also propose the 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for single directional light to\nrefine the incident lighting. The regularizations and the use of multi-view and\nmulti-light images mitigate the ill-posed problem of inverse rendering. After\noptimization, the reconstructed object can be used for novel-view synthesis,\nrelighting, and material and shape editing.

The proposed experiment tests the MediaPipe\nalgorithm for detecting facial landmarks in a controlled setting, using a\nrobotic arm that automatically adjusts positions while the surgical light and\nthe phantom remain in a fixed position. The results of this study demonstrate\nthat the improved accuracy of facial landmark detection under surgical lighting\nsignificantly enhances the detection performance at larger yaw and pitch\nangles. The increase in standard deviation/dispersion occurs due to imprecise\ndetection of selected facial landmarks.

Specifically,\nthe framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which\ninteract with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from\nnatural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level\nextraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are\nencoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive\nbehavior to dynamic disturbances.

To support this, we\nconstruct a part-level affordance annotation dataset to train the affordance\nmodel.
