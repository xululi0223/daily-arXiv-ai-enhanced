In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression\nresults show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and\nexecution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors\nalso influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical\neffects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the\ncharacter level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke\nlevels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution\nat the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic\ncomponents.

To tackle this, we\nintroduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based,\nbackpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model\ngeneralization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural\nadapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time\ndevice data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data\ndistributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The\nprototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix,\nfacilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer\nknowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter\nchanges and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and\nrecommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and\ngenerality."}

We find that, regardless of the length of\nthe biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant\nto a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and\nintegrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire\nbiasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information\nvolume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic\ncorrelation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and\ncalculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate\nrepresentations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level,\nphrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled\nto produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information\nacross various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual\nrecognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the\njoint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification\nmechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant\nbiasing phrases.

While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW\nconcepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or\ncelebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright\nand legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close\ndistances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained\nmanipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel\nmethod specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in\neasing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing\nthe concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference\nsubspace that minimizes the distance between the two.

We conduct\nextensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity\nerasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results\nwith current state-of-the-art methods.

Albeit efficient,\nPointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods\ndue to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to\npreserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a\ntwo-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows\nbetter performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the\nfirst two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,\nnarrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art\nmethods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel\ncomponents that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,\nwe introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D\nvoxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D\nconvolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels\ncan be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a\nseparable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using\n3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context\nfeature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a\nsparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,\nand fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object\nproposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good\ncompromise in terms of speed and accuracy."}

Recent research into the internal mechanisms of\nLLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,\nwhich plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this\ninsight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,\nwhich we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks.

To address these limitations,\nwe propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual\nsemantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of\nCLIP's vision encoder.

While there is broad agreement in some\ncircles that LLMs cannot count as authors, there is no consensus about whether\nand how humans using LLMs can count as authors. In many fields, authorship is\ndistributed among large teams of researchers, some of whom, including\nparadigmatic senior authors who guide and determine the scope of a project and\nultimately vouch for its integrity, may not write a single word.

We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset\nsimulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect\nratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal\ncold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,\nimproved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared\nto state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines.

Motivated by\nrecent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning\ncan further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving\nReasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based\nthinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to\nguide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained\ndetails, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train\nIRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),\nwhich targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate\nstage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality\ntextual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a\nsubsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed\nlearning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full\nthinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that\nnatively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first\nbuilds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline\nin the full thinking-image trajectory data.

This freedom of movement is\nreferred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any\nposition (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,\nthough, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the\nreconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the\nscene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as\n3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to\nsmall offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of\ncoordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error\nin pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to\nthe squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new\nquantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion\nperformance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden\nscene."}

This deviates from the expectation that the model should\nincrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data\nstreams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the\ndiscriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to\nrestricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class\nconfusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation\nlearning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown\nrepresentations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an\nangular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating\nexcessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt\na virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known\nrepresentations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through\nboundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification\nstrategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation\nbias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and\npositive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100\nand TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR.

Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models\npredominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to\nshort-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper,\nwe introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual\nforesight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a\nMixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception,\nforesight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation,\nand actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to\nsynthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By\nforecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation\nas a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that\nimplicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable\ncapabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset\ncomprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training\nscheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual\nforesight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive\nevaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1\nconsistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in\nboth task success rate and generalization ability."}

Classical\nmotion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full\nenvironment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural\nmotion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop\ndirectly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or\ndynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural\nmotion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic\nenvironments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is\nIMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million\ngenerated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further\nimprove IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher\nfinetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at\ninference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We\nevaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving\nobstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization,\noutperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both\nsimulated and real-world settings.
