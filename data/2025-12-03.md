TL;DR: RxBench是一个针对处方审查的综合性LLM基准测试，包含多种题型和14类常见处方错误，评估了18个前沿LLM，发现领先模型在某些任务上可匹敌或超越执业药师。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在临床决策支持中的快速应用，特别是在处方审查领域，需要建立一个系统化、细粒度的评估基准来全面衡量LLM的能力和局限性。

Method: 开发了RxBench基准测试，涵盖常见处方审查类别，整合了14类常见处方错误类型（基于权威药学参考资料）。包含1150道单选题、230道多选题和879道简答题，所有题目均由经验丰富的临床药师审核。评估了18个前沿LLM，并基于基准评估的洞察，对中等水平模型进行了针对性微调。

Result: LLM在不同任务上表现出明显的性能分层：Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06、Grok-4-0709和DeepSeek-R1-0528始终处于第一梯队，在准确性和鲁棒性上优于其他模型。与执业药师的比较表明，领先的LLM在某些任务上可匹敌或超越人类表现。通过针对性微调中等模型，得到的专用模型在简答题任务上可与领先的通用LLM相媲美。

Conclusion: RxBench建立了一个标准化、以错误类型为导向的评估框架，不仅揭示了前沿LLM在处方审查中的能力和局限性，还为构建更可靠、更专业的临床工具提供了基础资源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated their integration into clinical decision support, particularly in prescription review. To enable systematic and fine-grained evaluation, we developed RxBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers common prescription review categories and consolidates 14 frequent types of prescription errors drawn from authoritative pharmacy references. RxBench consists of 1,150 single-choice, 230 multiple-choice, and 879 short-answer items, all reviewed by experienced clinical pharmacists. We benchmarked 18 state-of-the-art LLMs and identified clear stratification of performance across tasks. Notably, Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, Grok-4-0709, and DeepSeek-R1-0528 consistently formed the first tier, outperforming other models in both accuracy and robustness. Comparisons with licensed pharmacists indicated that leading LLMs can match or exceed human performance in certain tasks. Furthermore, building on insights from our benchmark evaluation, we performed targeted fine-tuning on a mid-tier model, resulting in a specialized model that rivals leading general-purpose LLMs in performance on short-answer question tasks. The main contribution of RxBench lies in establishing a standardized, error-type-oriented framework that not only reveals the capabilities and limitations of frontier LLMs in prescription review but also provides a foundational resource for building more reliable and specialized clinical tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved from text generators into powerful problem solvers. Yet, many open tasks demand critical thinking, multi-source, and verifiable outputs, which are beyond single-shot prompting or standard retrieval-augmented generation. Recently, numerous studies have explored Deep Research (DR), which aims to combine the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with external tools, such as search engines, thereby empowering LLMs to act as research agents capable of completing complex, open-ended tasks. This survey presents a comprehensive and systematic overview of deep research systems, including a clear roadmap, foundational components, practical implementation techniques, important challenges, and future directions. Specifically, our main contributions are as follows: (i) we formalize a three-stage roadmap and distinguish deep research from related paradigms; (ii) we introduce four key components: query planning, information acquisition, memory management, and answer generation, each paired with fine-grained sub-taxonomies; (iii) we summarize optimization techniques, including prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and agentic reinforcement learning; and (iv) we consolidate evaluation criteria and open challenges, aiming to guide and facilitate future development. As the field of deep research continues to evolve rapidly, we are committed to continuously updating this survey to reflect the latest progress in this area.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become one of the most transformative tools across many applications, as they have significantly boosted productivity and achieved impressive results in various domains such as finance, healthcare, education, telecommunications, and law, among others. Typically, state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundation models are developed by large corporations based on large data collections and substantial computational and financial resources required to pretrain such models from scratch. These foundation models then serve as the basis for further development and domain adaptation for specific use cases or tasks. However, given the dynamic and fast-paced nature of launching new foundation models, the process of selecting the most suitable model for a particular use case, application, or domain becomes increasingly complex. We argue that there are two main dimensions that need to be taken into consideration when selecting a model for further training: a qualitative dimension (which model is best suited for a task based on information, for instance, taken from model cards) and a quantitative dimension (which is the best performing model). The quantitative performance of models is assessed through leaderboards, which rank models based on standardized benchmarks and provide a consistent framework for comparing different LLMs. In this work, we address the analysis of the quantitative dimension by exploring the current leaderboards and benchmarks. To illustrate this analysis, we focus on the medical domain as a case study, demonstrating the evolution, current landscape, and practical significance of this quantitative evaluation dimension. Finally, we propose a Model Selection Methodology (MSM), a systematic approach designed to guide the navigation, prioritization, and selection of the model that best aligns with a given use case.

TL;DR: 提出CCD框架，通过轨迹修正机制和自适应采样策略，提升扩散语言模型的生成质量和推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散语言模型的推理方法依赖局部即时指标（如置信度或熵），缺乏可靠的整体视角，导致采样轨迹不一致和生成质量不佳

Method: 提出CCD框架：1) 轨迹修正机制，利用历史上下文增强序列连贯性，早期拒绝次优路径；2) 自适应采样策略，根据一致性指标动态调整每个步骤的解码预算

Result: 在Dream和LLaDA基准测试中，推理速度提升最高达3.48倍，性能提升3.91%，实现了推理速度和性能的同步提升

Conclusion: CCD框架通过理论驱动的轨迹修正和自适应采样，有效解决了扩散语言模型推理中的一致性和效率问题，显著提升了生成质量和推理速度

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently achieved significant success due to their any-order generation capabilities. However, existing inference methods typically rely on local, immediate-step metrics such as confidence or entropy which inherently lack a more reliable perspective. This limitation frequently leads to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality. To address this, we propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), a novel inference framework built upon two core innovations. First, CCD employs a trajectory rectification mechanism that leverages historical context to enhance sequence coherence, enabling the early rejection of suboptimal paths. We demonstrate that this mechanism is theoretically equivalent to modeling the consistency of historical steps via the conditional mutual information between context and token predictions. Building on this theoretical insight, we further address the inefficiency of conventional uniform decoding budgets. Instead of rigid allocations based on diffusion steps, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget for each step according to our consistency metric. Consequently, our method significantly improves the quality of generation trajectories while accelerating the sampling process. Empirically, our method achieves a simultaneous enhancement in both inference speed and performance across diverse benchmarks on Dream and LLaDA, delivering up to 3.48x speedup alongside 3.91% performance improvement.

Conclusion: 提出的可逆架构为降低LLM训练和微调的内存与计算成本提供了可扩展且高效的路径，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their expensive and time-consuming training. Thus, oftentimes, LLMs are fine-tuned to address a specific task, given the pretrained weights of a pre-trained LLM considered a foundation model. In this work, we introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, and investigate their theoretical properties. Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations. This property allows for a drastic reduction in memory consumption, allowing for the processing of larger batch sizes for the same available memory, thereby offering improved throughput. In addition, we propose an efficient method for converting existing, non-reversible LLMs into reversible architectures through fine-tuning, rendering our approach practical for exploiting existing pre-trained models. Our results show comparable or improved performance on several datasets and benchmarks, on several LLMs, building a scalable and efficient path towards reducing the memory and computational costs associated with both training from scratch and fine-tuning of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方言识别对下游语音任务很重要，但传统微调方法计算成本和内存需求高，现有参数高效微调方法在内存效率和训练速度方面改进有限

Method: 将最初为语言处理设计的内存高效微调方法应用于通用预训练语音模型，全面分析不同MEFT方法的GPU内存使用和微调速度，以Whisper模型在KeSpeech数据集上的六种普通话子方言识别为案例研究

Result: GPU内存使用减少高达73.25%，训练速度加速2.1倍，同时保持与普通微调和PEFT方法相当的准确性

Conclusion: 内存高效微调方法能显著提高语音模型微调的内存效率和训练速度，为方言识别等任务提供实用解决方案

Abstract: Dialect Identification (DI) is a task to recognize different dialects within the same language from a speech signal. DI can help to improve the downstream speech related tasks even when speakers have a strong dialect. However, fine-tuning a speech model for tasks like DI is expensive in terms of computation cost and memory requirement. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning pre-trained speech models for tasks like DI using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which offer parameter efficiency but limited improvement in memory efficiency and training speed. To address these challenges, we explore Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods, originally proposed for language processing, and apply them to the general-purpose pre-trained speech model. We then comprehensively analyze the GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed based on various MEFT methods. As a case study, we fine-tune the Whisper model to identify six Mandarin subdialects from the KeSpeech dataset, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1, while maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods.

Motivation: 社交媒体上的辱骂性言论持续演变，新俚语和伪装术语不断出现以规避检测系统，需要更高效和适应性的内容审核方法

Method: 1) 使用TF-IDF样本选择机制保留最具信息量的75%训练样本；2) 在BERT分词器中加入领域特定俚语和词汇变体以增强对辱骂性术语的识别能力

Abstract: Abusive speech on social media poses a persistent and evolving challenge, driven by the continuous emergence of novel slang and obfuscated terms designed to circumvent detection systems. In this work, we present a data efficient strategy for fine tuning BERT on hate speech classification by significantly reducing training set size without compromising performance. Our approach employs a TF IDF-based sample selection mechanism to retain only the most informative 75 percent of examples, thereby minimizing training overhead. To address the limitations of BERT's native vocabulary in capturing evolving hate speech terminology, we augment the tokenizer with domain-specific slang and lexical variants commonly found in abusive contexts. Experimental results on a widely used hate speech dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while improving computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for scalable and adaptive abusive content moderation.

TL;DR: RESP是一种针对推理LLMs的自反思结构化剪枝框架，通过自生成校准、仅解码梯度重要性估计和渐进式再生，在保持推理能力的同时实现高稀疏度剪枝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理LLMs（如o1、DeepSeek-R1、Qwen3）虽然推理能力强，但模型大、推理成本高，不适合资源受限环境。现有剪枝方法对推理LLMs效果差，即使中等稀疏度（20%）也会严重损害推理准确性和连贯性。

Method: RESP框架包含三个关键组件：1）使用模型自生成推理轨迹作为校准数据，而非人工标注数据；2）仅解码梯度重要性估计，与推理时的解码行为对齐；3）渐进式再生策略，在稀疏度增加时保持校准保真度。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B上的实验显示，RESP在GSM8K和MathQA上显著优于现有结构化剪枝方法。在20-30%稀疏度下保持接近稠密模型的准确率，在40%稀疏度下达到81.3%（GSM8K）和59.6%（MathQA），分别比最强基线提升66.87%和47%。

Conclusion: RESP通过将剪枝决策与模型的推理动态对齐，解决了现有剪枝方法对推理LLMs的破坏性问题，为在资源受限环境中部署高性能推理LLMs提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs (RLMs) such as OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3 deliver strong multi-step reasoning through chain-of-thought generation, but their large model sizes and lengthy decode-time outputs make them costly to deploy and unsuitable for resource-constrained settings. To reduce computing and memory cost, pruning offers a promising solution by removing unimportant parameters. However, despite their success on standard LLMs, existing pruning methods severely damage RLMs, as even moderate sparsity (e.g., 20%) can collapse accuracy and completely disrupt the model's reasoning coherence. We begin by analyzing why existing pruning pipelines fail on reasoning LLMs and find that their brittleness largely stems from a mismatch between the calibration data, the pruning objective, and the model's decode-time reasoning behavior. Our study further shows that the most reliable calibration signal comes not from human-written labels but from the model's own self-generated reasoning traces, which more accurately reflect its inference distribution. Guided by these insights, we introduce RESP, a self-reflective structured pruning framework that aligns pruning decisions with the model's reasoning dynamics through self-generated calibration, decode-only gradient-based importance estimation, and progressive regeneration that maintains calibration fidelity as sparsity increases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate that RESP markedly outperforms existing structured pruning methods on both GSM8K and MathQA, preserving near-dense accuracy at 20-30% sparsity and substantially mitigating performance collapse at higher sparsity levels. At 40% sparsity, RESP attains 81.3% accuracy on GSM8K and 59.6% on MathQA, surpassing the strongest baselines by 66.87% and 47%, respectively.

Abstract: This paper presents an initial study performed by the MODOMA system. The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition.

Motivation: 大型语言模型通过生成长推理链来处理复杂任务，但使用强化学习优化推理过程计算成本高昂，特别是在涉及大量token的叙事相关任务中

Method: 提出LiteReason方法，包含轻量级推理投影器模块，生成连续潜在token帮助模型跳过推理步骤；在强化学习中，策略模型决定何时激活投影器，在潜在推理和离散推理之间切换

Result: 在情节漏洞检测和书籍章节生成任务上，方法优于潜在推理基线，接近非潜在强化学习训练的性能，同时将最终推理长度减少77-92%

Conclusion: LiteReason引导强化学习训练达到性能-计算权衡曲线中更高效的部分，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tackle complex tasks by generating long chains of thought or "reasoning traces" that act as latent variables in the generation of an output given a query. A model's ability to generate such traces can be optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve their utility in predicting an answer. This optimization comes at a high computational cost, especially for narrative-related tasks that involve retrieving and processing many tokens. To this end, we propose LiteReason, a latent reasoning method that can be interleaved with standard token sampling and easily combined with RL techniques. LiteReason employs a lightweight Reasoning Projector module, trained to produce continuous latent tokens that help the model 'skip' reasoning steps. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed. Experimental results on plot hole detection and book chapter generation show that our method outperforms latent reasoning baselines and comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92%. Overall, LiteReason guides RL training to a more efficient part of the performance-computation tradeoff curve.

Abstract: Prompt design plays a critical role in the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet the impact of prompt specificity - how detailed or vague a prompt is - remains understudied. This paper introduces DETAIL, a framework for evaluating LLM performance across varying levels of prompt specificity. We generate multi-level prompts using GPT-4, quantify specificity via perplexity, and assess correctness using GPT-based semantic equivalence. Experiments on 30 novel reasoning tasks across GPT-4 and O3-mini reveal that specificity improves accuracy, especially for smaller models and procedural tasks. Our results highlight the need for adaptive prompting strategies and provide tools and data to support further research.

Abstract: Climate adaptation strategies are proposed in response to climate change. They are practised in agriculture to sustain food production. These strategies can be found in unstructured data (for example, scientific literature from the Elsevier website) or structured (heterogeneous climate data via government APIs). We present Climate Adaptation question-answering with Improved Readability and Noted Sources (CAIRNS), a framework that enables experts -- farmer advisors -- to obtain credible preliminary answers from complex evidence sources from the web. It enhances readability and citation reliability through a structured ScholarGuide prompt and achieves robust evaluation via a consistency-weighted hybrid evaluator that leverages inter-model agreement with experts. Together, these components enable readable, verifiable, and domain-grounded question-answering without fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. Using a previously reported dataset of expert-curated question-answers, we show that CAIRNS outperforms the baselines on most of the metrics. Our thorough ablation study confirms the results on all metrics. To validate our LLM-based evaluation, we also report an analysis of correlations against human judgment.

*Boya Zhang,Alban Bornet,Rui Yang,Nan Liu,Douglas Teodoro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估语言模型在长且矛盾的生物医学上下文中的推理能力，发现生物医学微调模型不仅能利用正确上下文，还能抵抗错误上下文的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型如何使用上下文信息回答健康问题，以及当上下文存在矛盾时模型如何应对。现有医学问答评估基准无法充分区分模型在矛盾上下文中的推理能力。

Method: 使用专家验证的HealthContradict数据集（920个实例），每个实例包含健康问题、科学证据支持的事实答案和两个矛盾立场的文档。测试多种提示设置（正确、错误或矛盾上下文），测量对模型输出的影响。

Result: HealthContradict相比现有医学问答基准能更好地区分语言模型的上下文推理能力。实验显示生物医学微调模型不仅依赖预训练的参数知识，还能有效利用正确上下文同时抵抗错误上下文。

Conclusion: 生物医学微调语言模型在矛盾上下文推理中表现出色，其能力不仅来自预训练知识，还包括有效利用正确上下文和抵抗错误上下文的能力。

Abstract: How do language models use contextual information to answer health questions? How are their responses impacted by conflicting contexts? We assess the ability of language models to reason over long, conflicting biomedical contexts using HealthContradict, an expert-verified dataset comprising 920 unique instances, each consisting of a health-related question, a factual answer supported by scientific evidence, and two documents presenting contradictory stances. We consider several prompt settings, including correct, incorrect or contradictory context, and measure their impact on model outputs. Compared to existing medical question-answering evaluation benchmarks, HealthContradict provides greater distinctions of language models' contextual reasoning capabilities. Our experiments show that the strength of fine-tuned biomedical language models lies not only in their parametric knowledge from pretraining, but also in their ability to exploit correct context while resisting incorrect context.

### [15] [When Does Verification Pay Off? A Closer Look at LLMs as Solution Verifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02304)
*Jack Lu,Ryan Teehan,Jinran Jin,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了37个LLM在9个基准测试中的验证能力，发现跨模型家族验证效果最佳，后训练会降低自我改进但增强跨家族改进，数学和逻辑任务具有最高的可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对LLM作为问题求解器和解决方案验证器的交互作用研究有限，主要关注自我验证，缺乏跨模型家族验证的深入分析，且后训练对验证能力的影响尚不明确。

Method: 使用37个不同家族、规模和训练变体的LLM，在9个基准测试上进行系统评估，引入并验证"验证器增益"指标，分析模型规模、后训练和数据集可验证性的影响。

Result: 跨家族验证效果显著优于自我验证；后训练会降低模型的自我改进能力但增强跨家族改进；数学和逻辑任务具有最高的内在可验证性；验证器增益能有效预测性能提升。

Conclusion: LLM验证能力存在系统性差异，跨家族验证策略具有实用价值，后训练改变了模型的验证特性，任务类型影响可验证性，为LLM验证机制设计提供了实证基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as both problem solvers and solution verifiers, with verifiers improving solver performance by selecting high-quality answers from a pool of candidates. However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability. Our findings show that cross-family verification is especially effective; post-training reduces self-improvement but strengthens cross-family improvement; and mathematical and logical tasks exhibit the highest inherent verifiability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服务领域的特定领域问答系统面临整合异构知识源并确保准确性和安全性的挑战，现有大语言模型在医疗政策、政府福利等敏感领域存在事实一致性和上下文对齐问题。

Method: 提出KARMA框架，包含：1) 双编码器架构融合结构化与非结构化知识源；2) 门控记忆单元动态调节外部知识集成；3) 安全感知可控解码器，采用安全分类和引导生成技术减少不安全输出。

Result: 在专有QA数据集上的实验表明，KARMA在回答质量和安全性方面均优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为服务场景中构建可信赖且自适应的问答系统提供了全面解决方案。

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering (QA) systems for services face unique challenges in integrating heterogeneous knowledge sources while ensuring both accuracy and safety. Existing large language models often struggle with factual consistency and context alignment in sensitive domains such as healthcare policies and government welfare. In this work, we introduce Knowledge-Aware Reasoning and Memory-Augmented Adaptation (KARMA), a novel framework designed to enhance QA performance in care scenarios. KARMA incorporates a dual-encoder architecture to fuse structured and unstructured knowledge sources, a gated memory unit to dynamically regulate external knowledge integration, and a safety-aware controllable decoder that mitigates unsafe outputs using safety classification and guided generation techniques. Extensive experiments on a proprietary QA dataset demonstrate that KARMA outperforms strong baselines in both answer quality and safety. This study offers a comprehensive solution for building trustworthy and adaptive QA systems in service contexts.

TL;DR: TaleFrame是一个结合LLM和HCI的故事生成系统，通过将故事结构分解为实体、事件、关系和故事大纲四个基本单元，实现结构化控制，并支持用户通过拖拽等交互方式编辑故事元素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前故事生成系统缺乏细粒度控制，难以准确将用户意图转化为满意的故事输出，限制了其实际应用性。

Method: 提出TaleFrame系统：1) 将故事结构分解为实体、事件、关系和故事大纲四个基本单元；2) 使用Tinystories数据集构建9,851个JSON格式的偏好数据集；3) 微调本地Llama模型实现JSON2Story转换；4) 提供直观界面支持用户通过拖拽等交互方式创建和编辑故事元素。

Result: 1) 构建了包含9,851个条目的结构化故事数据集；2) 开发了支持结构化控制的故事生成系统；3) 通过七个维度（如创意性、结构完整性）评估生成的故事；4) 定量评估和用户研究证明了系统的实用性。

Conclusion: TaleFrame通过结构化故事表示和交互式编辑，实现了对故事生成的细粒度控制，有效解决了当前系统在意图转换和控制方面的不足，提高了故事生成的质量和用户满意度。

Abstract: With the advancement of natural language generation (NLG) technologies, creative story generation systems have gained increasing attention. However, current systems often fail to accurately translate user intent into satisfactory story outputs due to a lack of fine-grained control and unclear input specifications, limiting their applicability. To address this, we propose TaleFrame, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) with human-computer interaction (HCI) to generate stories through structured information, enabling precise control over the generation process. The innovation of TaleFrame lies in decomposing the story structure into four basic units: entities, events, relationships, and story outline. We leverage the Tinystories dataset, parsing and constructing a preference dataset consisting of 9,851 JSON-formatted entries, which is then used to fine-tune a local Llama model. By employing this JSON2Story approach, structured data is transformed into coherent stories. TaleFrame also offers an intuitive interface that supports users in creating and editing entities and events and generates stories through the structured framework. Users can control these units through simple interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, attach, and connect), thus influencing the details and progression of the story. The generated stories can be evaluated across seven dimensions (e.g., creativity, structural integrity), with the system providing suggestions for refinement based on these evaluations. Users can iteratively adjust the story until a satisfactory result is achieved. Finally, we conduct quantitative evaluation and user studies that demonstrate the usefulness of TaleFrame.

*Francesco Paolo Savatteri,Chahan Vidal-Gorène,Florian Cafiero*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了在线虚假信息检测和传播预测的实际任务，发现文本内容对假新闻检测效果显著，而传播预测更具挑战性且对标签构建敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估在线虚假信息处理中的两个实际任务：假新闻检测和传播预测，特别是在需要快速反应的运营环境中，比较不同方法的实用性和局限性。

Method: 使用EVONS和FakeNewsNet数据集，比较文本嵌入（RoBERTa、Mistral）与轻量级数值特征（时间、粉丝数、验证状态、点赞数）以及序列模型（GRU、门控架构、Transformer编码器），并进行降维分析（t-SNE vs PCA）。

Result: 文本内容单独对假新闻检测效果很好，而纯数值特征在语言模型不可用或计算受限时仍可行。传播预测比假新闻检测困难得多，对标签构建高度敏感，非线性结构对传播预测更有信息量。RoBERTa和Mistral嵌入的差异不大。

Conclusion: 研究强调了评估设计的重要性，指出了当前API限制下的实际约束，为度量选择提供指导，并讨论了可重复性问题对领域的影响。

Abstract: We present an evaluation-driven study of two practical tasks regarding online misinformation: (i) fake-news detection and (ii) virality prediction in the context of operational settings, with the necessity for rapid reaction. Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field. We release splits and code where possible and provide guidance for metric selection.

Motivation: 电商搜索中的相关性建模面临传统词匹配方法（如BM25）的语义鸿沟问题，以及神经模型依赖领域特定困难样本的稀缺性挑战。

Method: ADORE框架包含三个创新模块：1）规则感知相关性判别模块，使用思维链LLM生成意图对齐的训练数据，并通过Kahneman-Tversky优化对齐用户行为；2）错误类型感知数据合成模块，自动生成对抗样本来增强鲁棒性；3）关键属性增强知识蒸馏模块，将领域特定属性层次注入可部署的学生模型。

Conclusion: ADORE通过自动化标注、对抗生成和蒸馏，克服了数据稀缺问题，同时增强了推理能力，为电商搜索相关性建模提供了自持的解决方案。

Abstract: Relevance modeling in e-commerce search remains challenged by semantic gaps in term-matching methods (e.g., BM25) and neural models' reliance on the scarcity of domain-specific hard samples. We propose ADORE, a self-sustaining framework that synergizes three innovations: (1) A Rule-aware Relevance Discrimination module, where a Chain-of-Thought LLM generates intent-aligned training data, refined via Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to align with user behavior; (2) An Error-type-aware Data Synthesis module that auto-generates adversarial examples to harden robustness; and (3) A Key-attribute-enhanced Knowledge Distillation module that injects domain-specific attribute hierarchies into a deployable student model. ADORE automates annotation, adversarial generation, and distillation, overcoming data scarcity while enhancing reasoning. Large-scale experiments and online A/B testing verify the effectiveness of ADORE. The framework establishes a new paradigm for resource-efficient, cognitively aligned relevance modeling in industrial applications.

Abstract: We introduce DeepSeek-V3.2, a model that harmonizes high computational efficiency with superior reasoning and agent performance. The key technical breakthroughs of DeepSeek-V3.2 are as follows: (1) DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA): We introduce DSA, an efficient attention mechanism that substantially reduces computational complexity while preserving model performance in long-context scenarios. (2) Scalable Reinforcement Learning Framework: By implementing a robust reinforcement learning protocol and scaling post-training compute, DeepSeek-V3.2 performs comparably to GPT-5.

(3) Large-Scale Agentic Task Synthesis Pipeline: To integrate reasoning into tool-use scenarios, we developed a novel synthesis pipeline that systematically generates training data at scale. This methodology facilitates scalable agentic post-training, yielding substantial improvements in generalization and instruction-following robustness within complex, interactive environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在训练早期就混合正负优势信号，可能导致指导模糊和收益有限。需要更智能的信号利用方式。

Method: CAPO采用自适应课程机制：1) 引导阶段仅使用正优势样本进行模仿学习建立坚实基础；2) 后续阶段逐步引入负优势信号培养判别能力；3) 兼容多种优化方法（GRPO、PPO、RLOO、Reinforce++）。

Result: 在数学推理任务上实现稳定显著提升，并能有效泛化到多模态GUI推理场景，证明其作为通用鲁棒优化框架的有效性。

Conclusion: CAPO通过基于优势信号的课程学习机制，解决了现有方法混合正负信号的问题，提供了一种更有效的强化学习训练范式，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a paradigm for post-training large language models, boosting their reasoning capabilities. Such approaches compute an advantage value for each sample, reflecting better or worse performance than expected, thereby yielding both positive and negative signals for training. However, the indiscriminate mixing of the two signals in existing methods, especially from the early stages, may lead to ambiguous guidance and limited gains. To address this issue, we propose **CAPO** (**C**urriculum **A**dvantage **P**olicy **O**ptimization), an adaptive curriculum mechanism based on advantage signals. The proposed mechanism bootstraps imitation learning with positive-only advantage samples to establish robust foundations, and subsequently introduces negative signals to cultivate discriminative capabilities, thereby improving generalization across complex scenarios. Compatible with diverse optimization methods including GRPO, PPO, RLOO, and Reinforce++, our method consistently achieves stable and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks, and further generalizes effectively to multimodal Graphical User Interface (GUI) reasoning scenarios, establishing itself as a versatile and robust optimization framework.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在总结多文档时存在首因效应，更偏向首篇文档的语义内容，这对依赖LLM摘要的应用和AI代理系统构成风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM被广泛用于多文档摘要（如Google AI Overviews），但尚不清楚它们是否平等对待所有输入。本研究旨在探究LLM在总结多个立场不同的文档时是否存在顺序偏见。

Method: 构建40组支持-中立-反对立场的堕胎新闻文章三元组，每组按6种顺序排列，使用Gemini 2.5 Flash生成中立概述。通过ROUGE-L、BERTScore和SummaC评估摘要与源文档的相似性和事实一致性，并用单因素方差分析和配对比较检验顺序效应。

Result: BERTScore显示显著的首因效应：摘要与首篇文档的语义相似度最高。配对比较表明位置1与位置2、3有显著差异，而位置2和3之间无差异，证实LLM对首篇文档存在选择性偏好。

Conclusion: LLM在多文档摘要中存在首因效应，这给依赖LLM生成概述的应用和AI代理系统带来风险，因为LLM处理步骤可能对下游行动产生不成比例的影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in settings such as Google's AI Overviews, where it summarizes multiple long documents. However, it remains unclear whether they weight all inputs equally. Focusing on abortion-related news, we construct 40 pro-neutral-con article triplets, permute each triplet into six input orders, and prompt Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate a neutral overview. We evaluate each summary against its source articles using ROUGE-L (lexical overlap), BERTScore (semantic similarity), and SummaC (factual consistency). One-way ANOVA reveals a significant primacy effect for BERTScore across all stances, indicating that summaries are more semantically aligned with the first-seen article. Pairwise comparisons further show that Position 1 differs significantly from Positions 2 and 3, while the latter two do not differ from each other, confirming a selective preference for the first document. The findings present risks for applications that rely on LLM-generated overviews and for agentic AI systems, where the steps involving LLMs can disproportionately influence downstream actions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对7种模型合并算法（Linear、Karcher Mean、SLERP、NuSLERP、TIES、DELLA、Nearswap）在13个开源模型上的实证研究，发现模型合并能有效减少社会偏见，但存在偏见减少与下游任务性能的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型会继承并放大预训练数据中的社会偏见，威胁公平性和社会信任。现有研究探索通过编辑模型参数来减轻偏见，但缺乏不同模型合并算法的实证比较。

Method: 对7种模型合并算法在GPT、LLaMA和Qwen家族的13个开源模型上进行实证调查，使用BBQ、BOLD和HONEST三个偏见数据集评估偏见减少效果，并通过SuperGLUE基准测试下游任务性能影响。

Result: 发现偏见减少与下游性能之间存在权衡：偏见减少效果更好的方法会降低准确性，特别是在需要阅读理解、常识和因果推理的任务上。Linear、SLERP和Nearswap在减少偏见的同时保持了整体性能，其中中等插值权重的SLERP是最平衡的选择。

Conclusion: 模型合并算法在偏见缓解方面具有潜力，但过度去偏见或不恰当的合并方法可能导致重要语言能力的退化。需要在偏见减少和模型性能之间找到平衡点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to inherit and even amplify societal biases present in their pre-training corpora, threatening fairness and social trust. To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice. These results highlight the potential of model merging algorithms for bias mitigation, while indicating that excessive debiasing or inappropriate merging methods may lead to the degradation of important linguistic abilities.

### [26] [CREST: Universal Safety Guardrails Through Cluster-Guided Cross-Lingual Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02711)
*Lavish Bansal,Naman Mishra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CREST是一个参数高效的跨语言安全分类模型，仅用0.5B参数支持100种语言，通过在13种高资源语言上训练实现跨语言泛化，在安全基准测试中超越同类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全护栏主要针对高资源语言，导致使用低资源语言的大量人口得不到保护，需要开发能覆盖全球多语言的安全系统。

Method: 提出CREST模型，采用参数高效设计，仅用13种高资源语言训练，通过基于聚类的跨语言迁移技术将安全能力扩展到100种语言，包括未见的高资源和低资源语言。

Result: 在6个安全基准测试中，CREST超越了同等规模的最先进护栏模型，并与参数大5倍以上（2.5B+）的模型取得竞争性结果。

Conclusion: 语言特定的安全护栏存在局限性，需要开发通用的、语言无关的安全系统，以有效扩展到服务全球人口。

Abstract: Ensuring content safety in large language models (LLMs) is essential for their deployment in real-world applications. However, existing safety guardrails are predominantly tailored for high-resource languages, leaving a significant portion of the world's population underrepresented who communicate in low-resource languages. To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above). Our findings highlight the limitations of language-specific guardrails and underscore the importance of developing universal, language-agnostic safety systems that can scale effectively to serve global populations.

### [27] [Emergent Bayesian Behaviour and Optimal Cue Combination in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02719)
*Julian Ma,Jun Wang,Zafeirios Fountas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过心理物理学范式评估LLMs是否表现出类似人类的贝叶斯最优多模态整合能力，发现准确率高的模型不一定具备稳健的不确定性处理策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在显式推理方面表现出色，但其隐式计算策略（特别是多模态整合中的不确定性处理）尚未得到充分探索。人类在感知任务中能够使用接近最优的贝叶斯策略直觉地处理噪声信号，研究者想知道LLMs是否也表现出类似行为。

Method: 采用心理物理学范式，创建BayesBench基准测试：包含四个基于文本和图像的幅度估计任务（长度、位置、距离、持续时间）。评估9个不同的LLMs，通过控制噪声、上下文和指令提示的变化，测量多模态线索整合的性能、行为和效率。引入贝叶斯一致性分数来检测贝叶斯一致的行为变化。

Result: 研究发现：1）能力强的模型通常以贝叶斯一致的方式适应，但准确率不能保证稳健性；2）GPT-5 Mini在文本任务上达到完美准确率，但未能有效整合视觉线索；3）揭示了能力与策略之间的关键分离，表明以准确率为中心的基准测试可能过度关注性能而忽略了脆弱的不确定性处理。

Conclusion: LLMs在处理不确定性方面表现出新兴的原则性能力，准确率与贝叶斯倾向之间存在相关性。研究发布的心理物理学基准和一致性指标可作为评估工具，并为未来多模态架构设计提供参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at explicit reasoning, but their implicit computational strategies remain underexplored. Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric (https://bayes-bench.github.io) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs.

Motivation: 随着基于LLM的自动调研系统通过检索、组织和内容合成构建端到端生成流程，如何评估这种复杂系统成为一个重要挑战，现有研究主要关注开发新生成流程而缺乏系统评估方法。

Method: 提出SurveyEval基准，从整体质量、大纲连贯性和参考文献准确性三个维度评估自动生成的调研报告；扩展7个学科领域的评估，并在LLM-as-a-Judge框架中加入人类参考以增强评估与人类判断的一致性。

Result: 评估结果显示，通用长文本或论文写作系统倾向于生成较低质量的调研报告，而专门的调研生成系统能够提供显著更高质量的成果。

Conclusion: SurveyEval可作为可扩展的测试平台，用于理解和改进跨不同学科和评估标准的自动调研系统。

Abstract: LLM-based automatic survey systems are transforming how users acquire information from the web by integrating retrieval, organization, and content synthesis into end-to-end generation pipelines. While recent works focus on developing new generation pipelines, how to evaluate such complex systems remains a significant challenge. To this end, we introduce SurveyEval, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates automatically generated surveys across three dimensions: overall quality, outline coherence, and reference accuracy. We extend the evaluation across 7 subjects and augment the LLM-as-a-Judge framework with human references to strengthen evaluation-human alignment. Evaluation results show that while general long-text or paper-writing systems tend to produce lower-quality surveys, specialized survey-generation systems are able to deliver substantially higher-quality results. We envision SurveyEval as a scalable testbed to understand and improve automatic survey systems across diverse subjects and evaluation criteria.

TL;DR: UniFact是一个统一评估框架，用于直接比较事实核查和幻觉检测两种方法，发现混合方法效果最好，呼吁统一这两种研究范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常产生幻觉（看似流畅但事实错误的内容），这影响了实际应用。目前存在模型中心的幻觉检测和文本中心的事实核查两种独立研究范式，它们使用不同的假设、数据集和评估协议，形成了研究分裂，阻碍了共同进展。

Method: 提出UniFact统一评估框架，通过动态生成模型输出和相应的事实性标签，实现事实核查和幻觉检测在实例级别的直接比较。进行大规模实验，涵盖多个LLM家族和检测方法。

Result: 三个关键发现：1) 没有哪种范式普遍优越；2) 幻觉检测和事实核查捕捉了事实错误的互补方面；3) 整合两种方法的混合方法始终达到最先进的性能。提供了关于两种范式为何分化的深入分析。

Conclusion: 需要一个新的、整合的研究议程来统一大语言模型中的幻觉检测和事实核查。实验结果表明混合方法效果最佳，呼吁结束两种范式的分裂状态。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit hallucinations, generating content that appears fluent and coherent but is factually incorrect. Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs.

Motivation: 現有系統在訓練和評估領域之間存在分佈偏移問題，且對話式指代表達理解任務缺乏足夠的標註數據，需要解決這些挑戰以提升模型性能

Method: 採用三層數據合成方法，平衡真實性和可控性，為對話條件下的指代表達理解生成可擴展的監督數據

Result: 在合成數據上進行微調後，在標準評估指標上相比先前方法取得了持續且顯著的改進

Conclusion: 提出的數據合成方法有效解決了對話式廣義指代表達理解中的分佈偏移和數據稀缺問題，為該領域提供了可擴展的解決方案

Abstract: Dialogue-Based Generalized Referring Expressions Comprehension (GREC) requires models to ground the expression and unlimited targets in complex visual scenes while resolving coreference across a long dialogue context. However, existing systems struggle under distribution shift between training and evaluation domains, a gap exacerbated by the scarcity of annotated dialogue grounding data. We address this challenge with a three-tier data-synthesis method that balances realism and controllability to produce scalable supervision for dialogue-conditioned grounding. Fine-tuning on the synthesized data yields consistent, substantial improvements over prior approaches across standard evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: TriLex框架通过三阶段检索增强方法扩展低资源非洲语言的情感词典，提升AfroXLMR和AfriBERTa等预训练语言模型在情感分析中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源非洲语言在情感分析中代表性不足，限制了多语言NLP系统的词汇覆盖和性能表现。

Method: 提出TriLex三阶段检索增强框架：1) 基于语料库的提取；2) 跨语言映射；3) RAG驱动的词汇精炼。使用扩展后的词典评估AfroXLMR和AfriBERTa在多个案例研究中的性能。

Result: AfroXLMR表现最佳，在isiXhosa和isiZulu上F1分数超过80%，跨语言稳定性强。AfriBERTa虽未预训练目标语言，仍达到约64%的可靠F1分数。两种模型均优于传统机器学习基线，集成分析进一步提升了精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TriLex是扩展低资源南非语言多语言情感词典和情感建模的可扩展有效框架。

Abstract: Low-resource African languages remain underrepresented in sentiment analysis, limiting both lexical coverage and the performance of multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. This study proposes TriLex, a three-stage retrieval augmented framework that unifies corpus-based extraction, cross lingual mapping, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) driven lexical refinement to systematically expand sentiment lexicons for low-resource languages. Using the enriched lexicon, the performance of two prominent African pretrained language models (AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa) is evaluated across multiple case studies. Results demonstrate that AfroXLMR delivers superior performance, achieving F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu and exhibiting strong cross-lingual stability. Although AfriBERTa lacks pre-training on these target languages, it still achieves reliable F1-scores around 64%, validating its utility in computationally constrained settings. Both models outperform traditional machine learning baselines, and ensemble analyses further enhance precision and robustness. The findings establish TriLex as a scalable and effective framework for multilingual sentiment lexicon expansion and sentiment modeling in low-resource South African languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对齐方法依赖外部监督存在严重局限：人工标注稀缺且主观，奖励模型易受奖励攻击，自评估方法对提示敏感且有偏见。需要寻找无需外部监督的内在质量信号。

Method: 提出stable rank概念，通过计算总方差与主导方向方差的比率来测量隐藏状态的有效维度，捕捉信息在表示维度上的分布质量。基于此开发Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO)，使用stable rank作为强化学习的奖励信号。

Result: stable rank在RewardBench上达到84.04%准确率；通过Best-of-N采样比贪婪解码平均提升11.3个百分点任务准确率；SR-GRPO将Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct在STEM任务上提升10%，数学推理提升19%，优于学习奖励模型和自评估基线。

Conclusion: 质量信号可以从模型内部几何结构中提取，为无需外部监督的可扩展对齐提供了新路径，stable rank作为内在质量信号在评估和优化LLM方面表现出色。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences typically relies on external supervision, which faces critical limitations: human annotations are scarce and subjective, reward models are vulnerable to reward hacking, and self-evaluation methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and biases. In this work, we propose stable rank, an intrinsic, annotation-free quality signal derived from model representations. Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), which uses stable rank as a reward signal for reinforcement learning. Without external supervision, SR-GRPO improves Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on mathematical reasoning, outperforming both learned reward models and self-evaluation baselines. Our findings demonstrate that quality signals can be extracted from internal model geometry, offering a path toward scalable alignment without external supervision.

Conclusion: TCM-BEST4SDT为评估LLMs在中医临床辨证论治能力提供了全面基准，解决了现有评估方法的局限性，有助于推动中医智能化发展。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) domain presents an urgent need to assess their clinical application capabilities. However, such evaluations are challenged by the individualized, holistic, and diverse nature of TCM's "Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment" (SDT). Existing benchmarks are confined to knowledge-based question-answering or the accuracy of syndrome differentiation, often neglecting assessment of treatment decision-making. Here, we propose a comprehensive, clinical case-based benchmark spearheaded by TCM experts, and a specialized reward model employed to quantify prescription-syndrome congruence. Data annotation follows a rigorous pipeline. This benchmark, designated TCM-BEST4SDT, encompasses four tasks, including TCM Basic Knowledge, Medical Ethics, LLM Content Safety, and SDT. The evaluation framework integrates three mechanisms, namely selected-response evaluation, judge model evaluation, and reward model evaluation. The effectiveness of TCM-BEST4SDT was corroborated through experiments on 15 mainstream LLMs, spanning both general and TCM domains. To foster the development of intelligent TCM research, TCM-BEST4SDT is now publicly available.

Abstract: The globalization of education and rapid growth of online learning have made localizing educational content a critical challenge. Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety. Our experiments demonstrate that slide-aware transcripts also yield cascading benefits for downstream tasks such as summarization and question answering.

Abstract: System prompts provide a lightweight yet powerful mechanism for conditioning large language models (LLMs) at inference time. While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.

TL;DR: 该研究针对孟加拉语仇恨言论检测任务，复现官方基线方法并测试多种Transformer模型，发现语言特定预训练的BanglaBERT在低资源孟加拉语上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语作为拥有2.3亿使用者的语言，在计算资源上代表性不足，特别是在社交媒体自动审核方面。低资源语言的仇恨言论检测面临数据集不足、拼写异质性和语言多样性等挑战。

Method: 研究BLP 2025共享任务的子任务1A和1B，复现官方基线方法（多数类、随机、支持向量机），并加入逻辑回归、随机森林和决策树作为额外基线。同时使用基于Transformer的模型：DistilBERT、BanglaBERT、m-BERT和XLM-RoBERTa进行仇恨言论分类。

Result: 所有基于Transformer的模型（除DistilBERT外）在子任务上都优于基线方法。在Transformer模型中，BanglaBERT在两个子任务上表现最佳。尽管规模较小，BanglaBERT优于m-BERT和XLM-RoBERTa，表明语言特定预训练非常重要。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了预训练语言模型在低资源孟加拉语中的潜力和必要性，语言特定预训练对性能提升至关重要，为低资源语言的仇恨言论检测提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Hate speech recognition in low-resource languages remains a difficult problem due to insufficient datasets, orthographic heterogeneity, and linguistic variety. Bangla is spoken by more than 230 million people of Bangladesh and India (West Bengal). Despite the growing need for automated moderation on social media platforms, Bangla is significantly under-represented in computational resources. In this work, we study Subtask 1A and Subtask 1B of the BLP 2025 Shared Task on hate speech detection. We reproduce the official baselines (e.g., Majority, Random, Support Vector Machine) and also produce and consider Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree as baseline methods. We also utilized transformer-based models such as DistilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, and XLM-RoBERTa for hate speech classification. All the transformer-based models outperformed baseline methods for the subtasks, except for DistilBERT. Among the transformer-based models, BanglaBERT produces the best performance for both subtasks. Despite being smaller in size, BanglaBERT outperforms both m-BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, which suggests language-specific pre-training is very important. Our results highlight the potential and need for pre-trained language models for the low-resource Bangla language.

Result: 在AIME和GPQA上匹配或超越多数投票法；在LiveCodeBench（hard）上，DeepCoder-14B-Preview的pass@1提升+8.28%，Qwen3-8B提升+7.58%；在GAIA、BrowseComp-en/zh和XbenchDeepSearch上提升网络研究代理性能。

Conclusion: 并行测试时扩展可以在不依赖完整输出投票的情况下有益于开放端推理，ThinkMerge为开放端推理任务提供了有效的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: Majority voting has proven effective for close-ended question answering by aggregating parallel reasoning traces. However, it is not directly applicable to open-ended reasoning, such as code generation and web-based deep research, where a "majority" over complete solutions is ill-defined. We introduce ThinkMerge, a training-free, plug-and-play decoding strategy that runs K parallel reasoning traces and averages their next-token logits at synchronization points to produce a single coherent output. ThinkMerge integrates seamlessly with vLLM/SGLang and remains compatible with standard decoding techniques such as Top-p/Top-k. Empirically, it matches or surpasses majority voting on AIME and GPQA, while delivering consistent gains on open-ended coding tasks: on LiveCodeBench (hard), pass@1 improves by +8.28% for DeepCoder-14B-Preview and +7.58% for Qwen3-8B. Beyond code, we further show that ThinkMerge improves web-based deep-research agents (e.g., WebSailor-7B/32B) across GAIA, BrowseComp-en/zh, and XbenchDeepSearch. These results demonstrate that parallel test-time scaling can benefit open-ended reasoning without relying on voting over complete outputs.

TL;DR: SchED是一种无需训练、模型无关的早期退出算法，通过聚合全跨度logit边界并在满足平滑的进度相关置信度阈值时停止解码，显著加速扩散大语言模型的推理速度，同时保持高质量输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)相比自回归模型具有优势，但其迭代采样过程缓慢，严重限制了实际应用。需要一种高效的方法来加速dLLM的解码过程，同时保持输出质量。

Method: SchED是一种训练免费、模型无关的早期退出算法。它聚合全跨度logit边界，当满足平滑的进度相关置信度阈值时停止解码。算法不依赖模型训练，可应用于不同dLLM家族。

Result: 在指令调优模型上，SchED实现3.8-4.0倍加速，同时保持99.8-100%的基线分数；在基础模型上，实现一致加速增益，性能保持99.1-100%，最高可达2.34倍加速。在严格的质量惩罚指标(QPS, γ=4)下，SchED明显优于先前的置信度早期退出方法。

Conclusion: SchED通过将真实的置信度稳定转化为计算节省，使dLLM解码显著更高效。指令调优加速了预测熵的衰减，进一步提升了SchED的效果。该方法为扩散大语言模型的实用化提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer a promising alternative to autoregressive models, but their practical utility is severely hampered by slow, iterative sampling. We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $γ{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy. By turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient.

TL;DR: AutoNeural：专为NPU设计的视觉语言模型，通过MobileNetV5风格视觉编码器和SSM-Transformer混合语言模型，实现INT4/8/16量化稳定性和线性时间推理，在边缘设备上获得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有为GPU设计的视觉语言模型在NPU上表现不佳，主要原因是ViT的量化脆弱性和自回归注意力机制的I/O瓶颈，无法充分利用NPU的高算术吞吐量。

Method: 1) 用MobileNetV5风格的深度可分离卷积替换标准ViT编码器，确保激活分布有界以实现稳定INT4/8/16量化；2) 语言模型集成状态空间模型原理与Transformer层，使用门控卷积实现线性时间复杂度，消除KV缓存的内存I/O开销。

Result: 视觉编码器量化误差降低7倍，端到端延迟降低14倍，解码速度提升3倍，上下文窗口长度提升4倍。在Qualcomm SA8295P SoC上的真实汽车案例验证了驾驶舱应用的实时性能。

Conclusion: 为NPU约束重新设计模型拓扑是实现鲁棒多模态边缘智能的先决条件，AutoNeural展示了硬件感知模型设计的有效性。

Abstract: While Neural Processing Units (NPUs) offer high theoretical efficiency for edge AI, state-of-the-art Vision--Language Models (VLMs) tailored for GPUs often falter on these substrates. We attribute this hardware-model mismatch to two primary factors: the quantization brittleness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the I/O-bound nature of autoregressive attention mechanisms, which fail to utilize the high arithmetic throughput of NPUs. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoNeural, an NPU-native VLM architecture co-designed for integer-only inference. We replace the standard ViT encoder with a MobileNetV5-style backbone utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which ensures bounded activation distributions for stable INT4/8/16 quantization. Complementing this, our language backbone integrates State-Space Model (SSM) principles with Transformer layers, employing efficient gated convolutions to achieve linear-time complexity. This hybrid design eliminates the heavy memory I/O overhead of Key-Value caching during generation. Our approach delivers substantial efficiency gains, reducing quantization error of vision encoder by up to 7x and end-to-end latency by 14x compared to conventional baselines. The AutoNeural also delivers 3x decoding speed and 4x longer context window than the baseline. We validate these improvements via a real-world automotive case study on the Qualcomm SA8295P SoC, demonstrating real-time performance for cockpit applications. Our results highlight that rethinking model topology specifically for NPU constraints is a prerequisite for robust multi-modal edge intelligence.

TL;DR: 提出一個結合傳統NLP技術與微調語言模型的新框架，將英文句子轉換為邏輯表達式並生成CNF形式，以減少LLM在邏輯翻譯任務中的幻覺問題。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雖然大型語言模型在自然語言處理方面取得進展，能夠自動將自然語言翻譯為形式邏輯，但LLM產生的幻覺（錯誤輸出）在需要精確性的邏輯翻譯任務中特別具有挑戰性。這限制了自動推理、軟體系統除錯和規範遵循的應用。

Method: 提出一個新框架：輸入英文句子，先轉換為邏輯表達式，再翻譯為合取範式(CNF)以進行可滿足性求解。結合傳統NLP技術（使用自定義文法）、符號計算庫和微調的語言模型來減少幻覺問題。

Result: 初步實驗顯示，在不同文法設定下訓練的微調模型能夠有意識地修正原始模型產生的同類型幻覺，從而提供可靠的CNF生成。

Conclusion: 結合傳統NLP技術與微調語言模型的框架能有效減少邏輯翻譯任務中的幻覺問題，為自動推理和軟體驗證提供更可靠的解決方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs), have motivated the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal logic without human intervention. This enables automated reasoning and facilitates debugging, finding loop invariants, and adhering to specifications in software systems. However, hallucinations-incorrect outputs generated by LLMs are challenging, particularly for logical translation tasks requiring precision. This work introduces a novel framework that inputs English sentences, converts them into logical expressions, and then translates them into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for satisfiability solving. It employs classical NLP techniques with self-defined grammar, symbolic computation libraries, and a fine-tuned language model to reduce hallucinations. In the early experiments, we observed that the fine-tuned model, trained on different grammar settings, could intentionally correct the same types of hallucinations made by the original model. Thus, it provides reliable CNF generation.

TL;DR: MoCoP是一个无需数据集、闭环的道德一致性评估框架，通过三层分析自主生成、评估和优化伦理场景，发现LLMs的道德一致性与毒性呈强负相关，与响应延迟无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐框架依赖静态数据集和事后评估，难以捕捉道德推理在不同情境和时间尺度上的演变，需要动态、连续评估道德稳定性的方法。

Method: 提出Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP)框架，包含三层：词汇完整性分析、语义风险估计和基于推理的判断建模，形成自维持架构，无需外部监督自主生成、评估和优化伦理场景。

Result: 在GPT-4-Turbo和DeepSeek上验证，MoCoP有效捕捉纵向道德行为，发现道德维度与毒性维度呈强负相关(rET=-0.81,p<0.001)，与响应延迟几乎无关(rEL≈0)。

Conclusion: 道德一致性和语言安全是模型行为的稳定可解释特征，MoCoP将伦理评估重构为动态、模型无关的道德内省形式，为可扩展的持续审计提供了可复现基础。

Abstract: The rapid advancement and adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need for moral consistency, the capacity to maintain ethically coherent reasoning across varied contexts. Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.

TL;DR: 该研究对ESA-IBM的TerraMind地理空间基础模型进行微调，用于全球洪水范围制图，通过多模态光学和SAR数据集成，评估了不同配置在85个全球洪水事件上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水是最具破坏性的天气相关灾害之一，特别是在2024年创纪录的温暖年份。虽然地球观测卫星提供了关键的洪水监测数据，但传统方法的准确性严重依赖标注数据集和模型泛化能力。新兴的地理空间基础模型通过大规模自监督预训练提高了泛化性，但其在全球多样化洪水事件上的性能尚不明确。

Method: 使用包含85个全球洪水事件的FloodsNet多模态数据集（包含Sentinel-1 SAR和Sentinel-2光学影像），对TerraMind模型进行微调。测试了四种配置（基础vs大型模型；冻结vs解冻骨干网络），并与TerraMind Sen1Floods11示例以及基于FloodsNet和Sen1Floods11训练的U-Net模型进行比较。

Result: 基础-解冻配置在准确性、精确度和召回率之间取得了最佳平衡，且计算成本显著低于大型模型。大型解冻模型获得了最高的召回率。基于FloodsNet训练的模型在召回率上优于Sen1Floods11训练示例，同时保持相似的总体准确性。U-Net模型在所有GFM配置中获得了最高的召回率，但准确性和精确度略低。

Conclusion: 研究表明，集成多模态光学和SAR数据并微调地理空间基础模型可以增强近实时洪水制图能力。这是首次在全球范围内评估GFM用于洪水分割的研究之一，既展示了其在气候适应和灾害韧性方面的潜力，也指出了当前局限性。

Abstract: Floods are among the most damaging weather-related hazards, and in 2024, the warmest year on record, extreme flood events affected communities across five continents. Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.
  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model. The large unfrozen model achieved the highest recall. Models trained on FloodsNet outperformed the Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations, though with slightly lower accuracy and precision.
  Our results demonstrate that integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning a GFM can enhance near-real-time flood mapping. This study provides one of the first global-scale evaluations of a GFM for flood segmentation, highlighting both its potential and current limitations for climate adaptation and disaster resilience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比学习在广泛基准上表现出色，但对比损失函数可能导致信息失真。模型可能过度依赖相同标签样本的信息，而忽略来自同一原始图像的正样本对，特别是在大规模数据集中。

Method: 提出上下文增强对比损失函数，包含两个收敛目标：1) 对标签对比敏感，区分相同和不同类别的特征；2) 拉近来自同一源图像的增强样本，同时远离其他所有样本。

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR100、Caltech-101、Caltech-256、ImageNet、BiasedMNIST、UTKFace和CelebA等8个数据集上评估，相比16种SOTA对比学习方法，在泛化性能和收敛速度上均有提升。在BiasedMNIST下游任务中，相比原始对比损失函数提升22.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决对比学习中的信息失真问题，提高训练效率和公平性，特别在处理系统性失真任务方面表现突出。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种联合评估文本到图像生成模型和视觉语言模型的层次化框架，通过测试VLM能否识别T2I模型生成的图像中的27种特定错误模式，并创建了包含5个T2I模型和3个VLM的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前T2I模型生成的图像虽然视觉上令人印象深刻，但经常无法准确捕捉用户提示中的特定属性（如正确数量和颜色）。同时，VLM的评估基准未能跟上它们需要标注的复杂场景。需要一种结构化方法来联合评估这两种模型的能力。

Method: 提出了一种结构化方法：1) 定义27种特定的错误模式；2) 使用5个T2I模型（Flux, SD3系列）基于挑战性提示生成图像；3) 使用3个VLM（Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral）识别图像中的错误模式；4) 通过LLM（Llama3）对VLM的标注进行验证；5) 创建包含提示、生成图像和VLM标注的数据集。

Result: 分析揭示了T2I模型在属性保真度和对象表示方面的系统性错误。发现当前评估指标不足以捕捉这些细微错误，强调了针对性基准测试对于提升生成模型可靠性和可解释性的重要性。

Conclusion: 需要层次化的评估框架来比较不同图像生成模型的提示遵循能力。提出的联合评估方法能够揭示T2I模型和VLM的系统性错误，为改进生成模型的可靠性和可解释性提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are capable of generating visually impressive images, yet they often fail to accurately capture specific attributes in user prompts, such as the correct number of objects with the specified colors. The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation. Our findings suggest that current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.

Motivation: 癌症治疗依赖早期诊断，医学影像和基因信息在临床中分别用于初始诊断和治疗选择。本研究旨在建立从医学影像预测体细胞突变谱的模型，实现早期基因信息获取。

Method: 1) 引入病灶图像的点云表示以实现成像模态不变性；2) 提出LLOST模型：双变分自编码器通过共享潜在空间连接点云特征和突变计数；3) 三个潜在空间均使用条件归一化流先验处理不同域的分布多样性。

Result: 在TCIA医学影像和TCGA Pan Cancer体细胞突变数据集上验证，模型能预测特定突变计数和突变发生，并识别影像与突变域之间反映癌症类型的共享模式。

Conclusion: 模型展示了从医学影像预测基因突变的可行性，未来可改进模型并扩展到其他遗传领域，为早期癌症诊断和治疗选择提供支持。

Abstract: Medical imaging is a critical initial tool used by clinicians to determine a patient's cancer diagnosis, allowing for faster intervention and more reliable patient prognosis. At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type. We conclude with a remark on how to improve the model and possible future avenues of research to include other genetic domains.

TL;DR: SplatSuRe：一种选择性应用超分辨率的方法，只在缺乏高频监督的欠采样区域添加SR内容，从而获得更清晰、更一致的3D高斯溅射渲染结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射（3DGS）能够实现高质量的新视角合成，但训练时通常使用低分辨率视图。传统方法对所有图像统一应用超分辨率会导致多视角不一致和模糊渲染。现有方法试图通过学习神经组件、时间一致的视频先验或联合优化来缓解这些问题，但都未能解决选择性增强的需求。

Method: 提出SplatSuRe方法，核心洞察是近距离的低分辨率视图可能包含与远距离视图相同区域的高频信息，可以利用相机姿态相对于场景几何的信息来确定在哪里添加超分辨率内容。该方法选择性地只在缺乏高频监督的欠采样区域应用超分辨率内容。

Result: 在Tanks & Temples、Deep Blending和Mip-NeRF 360等数据集上，该方法在保真度和感知质量方面均超越了基线方法。特别是在需要更高细节的局部前景区域，改进效果最为显著。

Conclusion: 通过选择性应用超分辨率内容，SplatSuRe方法能够产生更清晰、更一致的渲染结果，特别是在需要高细节的区域表现优异，为3D高斯溅射的高分辨率渲染提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality novel view synthesis, motivating interest in generating higher-resolution renders than those available during training. A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Notably, our gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

TL;DR: 提出RobustSurg方法，通过利用手术场景中的风格和内容信息来提升跨中心和跨模态的泛化能力，在未见数据上相比基线有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习手术场景分割方法通常在单中心和单模态数据上表现良好，但难以泛化到未见分布（其他中心）和未见模态。自然场景的域泛化方法不能直接应用于手术场景，因为手术场景视觉线索有限且场景极其多样。

Method: 通过实例归一化和特征协方差映射技术来获得鲁棒和可泛化的特征表示；在ResNet骨干网络中引入恢复模块，以保留有用的任务相关特征；同时提供了一个新的多类多中心数据集。

Result: 在未见中心HeiCholSeg数据集上，相比基线DeepLabv3+有近23%提升，相比SOTA有10-32%提升（mIoU）；在EndoUDA息肉数据集的目标集上，相比基线有近22%提升，相比最新SOTA有近11%提升。

Conclusion: 通过利用手术场景的风格和内容信息，结合实例归一化、特征协方差映射和恢复模块，可以有效提升手术场景分割的跨域泛化能力，为手术AI的临床应用提供了重要进展。

Abstract: While recent advances in deep learning for surgical scene segmentation have demonstrated promising results on single-centre and single-imaging modality data, these methods usually do not generalise to unseen distribution (i.e., from other centres) and unseen modalities. Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K. Similarly, RobustSurg also obtained nearly 22% improvement over the baseline and nearly 11% improvement on a recent SOTA method for the target set of the EndoUDA polyp dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种归纳先验方法：单分形和多分形重校准，通过利用指数概率质量与多分形谱之间的关系，在卷积网络中实现通道注意力机制，显著提升医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端多分形方法依赖大量池化或强特征空间降采样，限制了语义分割等任务的应用。多分形分析在捕捉病理规律方面具有优势，但在现代深度学习中的应用仍然有限。

Method: 提出两种归纳先验：单分形重校准和多分形重校准。这些方法利用指数概率质量与多分形谱之间的关系，形成编码器嵌入的统计描述，作为卷积网络中的通道注意力函数实现。使用U-Net框架进行验证。

Result: 多分形重校准在使用高阶统计的其他通道注意力机制基础上取得显著提升。在三个公开医学影像数据集（ISIC18皮肤镜、Kvasir-SEG内窥镜、BUSI超声）上验证了方法的有效性。发现注意力层在U-Net中由于跳跃连接，激发响应不会随编码器深度增加而过度专业化。

Conclusion: 多分形重校准方法能够有效提升医学图像分割性能，注意力层的有效性可能与实例变异的全局统计特性相关。该方法为多分形分析在深度学习中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multifractal analysis has revealed regularities in many self-seeding phenomena, yet its use in modern deep learning remains limited. Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.
  Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).
  Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers. We find that excitation responses do not become increasingly specialized with encoder depth in U-Net architectures due to skip connections, and that their effectiveness may relate to global statistics of instance variability.

### [51] [Towards Unified Video Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02224)
*Chen Feng,Tianhao Peng,Fan Zhang,David Bull*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Unified-VQA框架，通过诊断性专家混合模型解决通用视频质量评估问题，支持多种视频格式和失真类型，提供可解释的质量反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA方法存在三个主要问题：1）单一质量分数无法提供诊断性、可解释的反馈；2）大多是特定格式的专用指标而非真正通用的解决方案；3）从不同感知域学习妥协表示。

Method: 提出Unified-VQA框架，将通用VQA重新定义为诊断性专家混合问题。采用多个"感知专家"专门处理不同感知域，设计多代理专家训练策略，使用排序启发损失优化每个专家。集成诊断性多任务头生成全局质量分数和可解释的多维伪影向量。

Result: 在不重新训练或微调的情况下，Unified-VQA在17个包含HD、UHD、HDR和HFR格式的数据库上，相比18个基准方法在通用VQA和诊断伪影检测任务上均表现出一致且优越的性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向实用、可操作和可解释的视频质量评估迈出的重要一步，提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent works in video quality assessment (VQA) typically employ monolithic models that typically predict a single quality score for each test video. These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain. We also integrated a diagnostic multi-task head into this framework to generate a global quality score and an interpretable multi-dimensional artifact vector, which is optimized using a weakly-supervised learning strategy, leveraging the known properties of the large-scale training database generated for this work. With static model parameters (without retraining or fine-tuning), Unified-VQA demonstrates consistent and superior performance compared to over 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection tasks across 17 databases containing diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR and HFR formats. This work represents an important step towards practical, actionable, and interpretable video quality assessment.

TL;DR: AV-SpeakerBench是一个专注于说话人中心视听推理的基准测试，包含3212个多选题，评估模型在真实视频中理解谁在说话、说了什么以及何时说话的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准测试很少评估对人类语音的细粒度推理，许多任务要么可以通过视觉解决，要么只粗略评估语音，无法深入了解模型是否能对齐说话者、内容和时间信息。

Method: 设计了说话人中心的基准测试，将说话者而非场景作为核心推理单元；采用融合基础的问题设计，将视听依赖嵌入问题语义；通过专家标注确保时间精度和跨模态有效性。

Result: Gemini系列模型表现最佳，Gemini 2.5 Pro取得最好结果。开源模型中，Qwen3-Omni-30B接近Gemini 2.0 Flash，但远落后于Gemini 2.5 Pro，主要原因是视听融合能力较弱而非视觉感知。

Conclusion: AV-SpeakerBench为推进未来多模态系统的细粒度视听推理建立了严谨的基础。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to jointly interpret vision, audio, and language, yet existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech. Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于脉冲神经网络的图像去雨方法，通过创新的VLIF神经元和分解增强模块，在显著降低能耗的同时实现了优于现有SNN方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络（SNNs）作为生物可解释且节能的框架，在低层视觉任务中尚未得到充分探索。传统脉冲神经元缺乏空间上下文理解能力，且存在频域饱和的限制，这阻碍了SNNs在图像去雨等任务中的应用。

Method: 1. 提出视觉LIF（VLIF）神经元，克服传统脉冲神经元缺乏空间上下文理解的障碍；2. 利用VLIF构建脉冲分解与增强模块；3. 设计轻量级脉冲多尺度单元，实现分层多尺度表示学习。

Result: 在五个基准去雨数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法显著优于最先进的基于SNN的去雨方法，且仅消耗传统方法13%的能量。

Conclusion: 该研究为在高性能、节能的低层视觉任务中部署SNNs奠定了坚实基础，展示了SNNs在图像处理任务中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Biologically plausible and energy-efficient frameworks such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have not been sufficiently explored in low-level vision tasks. Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\% of their energy consumption. These findings establish a solid foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法依赖天气尺度自回归，对长期气候模拟速度慢且无法在非平稳强迫下稳定展开，需要更高效的气候模拟方法

Method: SPF将生成轨迹划分为时空金字塔，逐步增加空间分辨率减少计算，每个阶段耦合特定时间尺度，并基于物理强迫条件进行模拟

Result: 在ClimateBench上年和月尺度上超越强基线，创建ClimateSuite最大地球系统模拟数据集，SPF在跨气候模型场景中表现出良好泛化能力

Conclusion: SPF和ClimateSuite为跨时间尺度和现实未来场景的准确、高效、概率性气候模拟提供了基础

Abstract: Generative models have the potential to transform the way we emulate Earth's changing climate. Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到视频模型具有强大的时序生成能力，但在图像修复方面的潜力尚未充分探索。研究旨在利用这些模型的时序生成特性来实现渐进式视觉修复。

Method: 通过微调CogVideo模型，使其生成修复轨迹而非自然视频运动。构建合成数据集（超分辨率、去模糊、低光增强），每个样本包含从退化到清晰帧的渐进过渡。比较两种提示策略：统一文本提示和基于LLaVA多模态LLM生成、ChatGPT精炼的场景特定提示。

Result: 微调后的模型能够将时序进展与修复质量关联，生成的序列在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS等感知指标上逐帧提升。实验显示模型能有效恢复空间细节和光照一致性，同时保持时序连贯性。在ReLoBlur数据集上无需额外训练即展现零样本鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 文本到视频模型可成功重新用于渐进式视觉修复任务，通过时序修复过程提供可解释性，并在真实场景中展现良好的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent text-to-video models have demonstrated strong temporal generation capabilities, yet their potential for image restoration remains underexplored. In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. Moreover, the model generalizes to real-world scenarios on the ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 現有深度學習SAR油污分割模型在不同區域間泛化能力差，特別是在秘魯海岸標註數據稀缺的情況下，模型從地中海遷移到秘魯時性能大幅下降

Method: 兩階段合成增強框架：第一階段使用形態學區域擾動（Morphological Region Perturbation）生成油污和相似區域的幾何變化；第二階段使用條件生成模型渲染SAR紋理

Result: 模型從地中海遷移到秘魯時mIoU從67.8%降至51.8%；使用MORP-Synth後提升達+6 mIoU，少數類IoU顯著提升（油污+10.8，相似區域+14.6）

Conclusion: MORP-Synth能有效改善SAR油污分割模型的跨區域泛化能力，特別是在標註數據稀缺的區域，為實際應用提供了可行解決方案

Abstract: Deep learning models for SAR oil spill segmentation often fail to generalize across regions due to differences in sea-state, backscatter statistics, and slick morphology, a limitation that is particularly severe along the Peruvian coast where labeled Sentinel-1 data remain scarce. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{MORP--Synth}, a two-stage synthetic augmentation framework designed to improve transfer from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions. Stage~A applies Morphological Region Perturbation, a curvature guided label space method that generates realistic geometric variations of oil and look-alike regions. Stage~B renders SAR-like textures from the edited masks using a conditional generative INADE model. We compile a Peruvian dataset of 2112 labeled 512$\times$512 patches from 40 Sentinel-1 scenes (2014--2024), harmonized with the Mediterranean CleanSeaNet benchmark, and evaluate seven segmentation architectures. Models pretrained on Mediterranean data degrade from 67.8\% to 51.8\% mIoU on the Peruvian domain; MORP--Synth improves performance up to +6 mIoU and boosts minority-class IoU (+10.8 oil, +14.6 look-alike).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督跟踪器在视觉线索模糊时表现不佳，需要大量标注数据，而预训练视频扩散模型已学习到适合跟踪的运动表示

Method: 利用预训练视频扩散模型的去噪过程：早期高噪声阶段分离运动信息，后期阶段细化外观，从而提取运动表示用于跟踪

Result: 在标准基准测试和新设计的视觉相似物体跟踪测试中，相比近期自监督方法提升高达6个百分点，能鲁棒跟踪相同物体

Conclusion: 预训练视频扩散模型固有地学习到适合跟踪的运动表示，无需任务特定训练，为自监督跟踪提供了新方向

Abstract: Distinguishing visually similar objects by their motion remains a critical challenge in computer vision. Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.

TL;DR: 提出TALO框架，基于薄板样条实现高自由度长期对齐，解决3D视觉基础模型在在线场景中的时间一致性难题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D视觉基础模型在单次前向传播中表现出色，但在在线场景（如驾驶）中，需要在时间窗口内进行预测，难以保持时间一致性。现有方法通过求解全局变换对齐连续预测，但在假设有效性、局部对齐范围和噪声几何鲁棒性方面存在根本限制。

Method: 提出基于薄板样条的高自由度长期对齐框架，利用全局传播的控制点校正空间变化的不一致性；采用点无关的子图配准设计，对噪声几何预测具有固有鲁棒性；完全即插即用，兼容多种3D基础模型和相机配置。

Result: 在多个数据集、骨干模型和相机设置上的广泛实验表明，该方法始终产生更一致的几何结构和更低的轨迹误差，突显其鲁棒性和通用性。

Conclusion: TALO框架有效解决了3D视觉基础模型在在线场景中的时间一致性问题，通过高自由度对齐和鲁棒设计，在各种条件下都能提供更连贯的几何预测。

Abstract: 3D vision foundation models have shown strong generalization in reconstructing key 3D attributes from uncalibrated images through a single feed-forward pass. However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积神经网络在SAR任务中表现出色，但其内部机制的复杂性和不透明性阻碍了高可靠性要求的实现，限制了在SAR中的应用。提高CNN的可解释性对其在SAR中的发展和部署至关重要。

Method: 提出多权重自匹配类激活映射(MS-CAM)方法，将SAR图像与CNN提取的特征图和对应梯度进行匹配，结合通道权重和元素权重来可视化模型在SAR图像中的决策依据。

Result: 在自建的SAR目标分类数据集上进行大量实验，证明MS-CAM能更准确地突出网络的关注区域并捕捉详细的目标特征信息，从而增强网络可解释性。同时验证了MS-CAM在弱监督目标定位中的可行性，并深入分析了像素阈值等影响定位精度的关键因素。

Conclusion: MS-CAM方法有效提升了SAR图像中CNN的可解释性，为弱监督目标定位提供了可行方案，分析的关键因素为未来工作提供了指导。

Abstract: In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success in various synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tasks. However, the complexity and opacity of their internal mechanisms hinder the fulfillment of high-reliability requirements, thereby limiting their application in SAR. Improving the interpretability of CNNs is thus of great importance for their development and deployment in SAR. In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability. Furthermore, the feasibility of applying MS-CAM to weakly-supervised obiect localization is validated. Key factors affecting localization accuracy, such as pixel thresholds, are analyzed in depth to inform future work.

Motivation: 统一多模态模型虽然整合了理解和生成能力，但带来了推理效率问题，因为特定任务或样本可能不需要模型的全部知识和容量。目前对这些低效性在不同组件中如何表现的系统性理解还很有限。

Method: 首先使用训练无关剪枝作为探测方法，对统一多模态模型组件进行系统性分析（包括深度剪枝和宽度缩减）。然后提出基于混合专家（MoE）的适配方法，将生成模块划分为多个专家并启用稀疏激活来恢复生成质量。

Result: 研究发现理解组件在理解和生成任务中都表现出显著的可压缩性，而生成组件对压缩高度敏感。提出的MoE适配方法通过专家冻结调优验证了稀疏激活的有效性，完全可训练的适配带来额外增益。适配后的BAGEL模型仅激活约一半参数即可达到全模型性能。

Conclusion: 统一多模态模型存在组件效率差异，理解组件可压缩性强而生成组件敏感。通过MoE稀疏激活适配可以有效提升推理效率，在保持性能的同时显著减少激活参数数量，为高效多模态模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in both understanding and generation. Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters. The code is released at \href{https://github.com/Shwai-He/SparseUnifiedModel}{this link}.

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting can effectively mitigate occlusion issues that commonly arise in single-image crowd counting. Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods. Code is released in https://github.com/zqyq/Weakly-MVCC.

Conclusion: VACoT通过推理时动态图像增强有效提升视觉语言模型的感知鲁棒性，相比传统训练方法减少了计算开销，为对抗性场景下的视觉理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: While visual data augmentation remains a cornerstone for training robust vision models, it has received limited attention in visual language models (VLMs), which predominantly rely on large-scale real data acquisition or synthetic diversity. Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios.

Result: SqueezeNet表现显著优于ResNet-50：损失32% vs 54%，准确率89% vs 73%，精确率98% vs 88%，召回率80% vs 52%，F1分数87% vs 65%。SqueezeNet在所有指标上都显示出更好的性能。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在结核病检测中具有巨大潜力，特别是SqueezeNet表现优异。这类模型可集成到移动设备中，在资源匮乏地区扩大应用。但仍需开发更快、更小、更准确的结核病检测模型，以支持全球结核病防治工作。

Abstract: This study explores the application of machine learning models, specifically a pretrained ResNet-50 model and a general SqueezeNet model, in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) using chest X-ray images. TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources. However, despite promising results, the need for continued development of faster, smaller, and more accurate TB detection models remains crucial in contributing to the global efforts in combating TB.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for the reliability and safety of autonomous driving systems, yet it remains a challenging task in complex interactive scenarios. Existing methods often struggle to efficiently extract valuable scene information from redundant data, thereby reducing computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with intricate agent interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel map-free trajectory prediction algorithm that achieves trajectory prediction across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. Specifically, in temporal information processing, We utilize a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to adaptively select critical frequency components. Concurrently, we extract these components and integrate multi-scale temporal features. Subsequently, a selective attention module is proposed to filter out redundant information in both temporal sequences and spatial interactions. Finally, we design a multimodal decoder. Under the supervision of patch-level and point-level losses, we obtain reasonable trajectory results. Experiments on Nuscences datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm, validating its effectiveness in handling complex interactive scenarios.

TL;DR: SAGE是一个用于语义分割领域泛化的风格自适应框架，通过合成视觉提示来提升冻结模型在隐私约束下的泛化能力，无需修改模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实场景中，由于隐私和安全约束，无法访问模型参数和架构细节，传统微调方法受到限制，需要不修改模型权重的输入级策略来增强泛化能力。

Method: SAGE通过学习合成视觉提示来隐式对齐跨风格的特征分布。首先利用风格迁移构建源域的多样化风格表示，然后根据每个输入的视觉上下文自适应融合这些风格线索，形成动态提示来协调图像外观。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，SAGE在隐私约束下实现了与最先进方法相当或更优的性能，在所有设置中都优于完全微调的基线方法。

Conclusion: SAGE通过闭环设计有效弥合了冻结模型不变性与未见域多样性之间的差距，为隐私约束下的领域泛化提供了有效的输入级解决方案。

Abstract: Domain generalization for semantic segmentation aims to mitigate the degradation in model performance caused by domain shifts. However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}tyle-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{GE}neralization framework (\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings.

Method: 基于SfM on-the-fly，集成三个模块：1) 在线增量粗网格生成用于动态扩展稀疏点云；2) 带可操作指标的在线网格质量评估；3) 预测性路径规划用于飞行中轨迹优化

Result: 实验表明方法能实现近实时的现场重建和评估，提供可操作反馈显著减少覆盖缺口和重复飞行成本，实现从被动工作模式向智能自适应探索工作流的转变

Conclusion: 通过集成数据采集、处理、三维重建评估和在线反馈，On-the-fly Feedback SfM为传统被动工作模式向智能自适应探索工作流转变提供了可行方案

Abstract: Compared with conventional offline UAV photogrammetry, real-time UAV photogrammetry is essential for time-critical geospatial applications such as disaster response and active digital-twin maintenance. However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow. Code is now available at https://github.com/IRIS-LAB-whu/OntheflySfMFeedback.

TL;DR: FDTA提出了一种显式特征细化框架，通过空间、时间和身份适配器增强目标嵌入的判别性，解决端到端多目标跟踪中关联准确率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端多目标跟踪方法虽然检测性能强，但关联准确率较低。研究发现共享DETR架构生成的目标嵌入具有过高的目标间相似性，因为它只关注单帧内的类别级区分，而跟踪需要跨帧的实例级区分以及时空连续性。

Method: 提出FDTA框架，包含三个互补的特征细化模块：1) 空间适配器(SA)集成深度感知线索增强空间连续性；2) 时间适配器(TA)聚合历史信息建模时间依赖；3) 身份适配器(IA)利用质量感知对比学习增强实例级可分离性。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的MOT基准测试（DanceTrack、SportsMOT、BFT）上实现了最先进的性能，证明了所提出的判别性嵌入增强策略的有效性。

Conclusion: FDTA通过显式特征细化有效解决了端到端多目标跟踪中目标嵌入判别性不足的问题，显著提升了关联准确率，为MOT任务提供了新的特征增强解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have recently achieved remarkable progress by unifying detection and association within a single framework. Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

Motivation: 4D雷达在恶劣天气条件下具有鲁棒感知潜力，但雷达语义分割研究受到开源数据集和标签稀缺的限制。RaDelft数据集仅提供LiDAR标注且无公开代码，限制了可复现性和下游研究。

Method: 通过将雷达点云投影到基于相机的语义分割结果中，并应用空间聚类，创建相机引导的雷达标注流程，无需依赖人工标注。

Conclusion: 提出的相机引导雷达标注方法能够生成准确的雷达语义分割标签，为研究社区提供了可复现的训练和评估框架，并分析了恶劣天气条件对标注性能的影响。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D radar highlight its potential for robust environment perception under adverse conditions, yet progress in radar semantic segmentation remains constrained by the scarcity of open source datasets and labels. The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels. These results establish a reproducible framework that allows the research community to train and evaluate the labeled 4D radar data. In addition, we study and quantify how different fog levels affect the radar labeling performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将图像操作和网页搜索视为分离能力，依赖昂贵的强化学习，且缺乏基于真实工具执行轨迹的规划。需要开发能统一这些能力、通过监督学习实现复杂推理的多模态智能体系统。

Method: 开发300亿参数多模态模型Skywork-R1V4，统一多模态规划、主动图像操作（"用图像思考"）、深度多模态搜索和交错推理。仅使用不到30,000条高质量、规划-执行一致的轨迹进行监督微调，并通过逐步一致性过滤验证。

Result: 在MMSearch上得分66.1，FVQA上得分67.2，在全部11个指标上超越Gemini 2.5 Flash。模型展现出推理时的涌现长程推理能力，能成功协调超过10个工具调用来解决复杂多步任务。

Conclusion: 精心策划的监督学习足以实现复杂的多模态智能体智能，无需依赖强化学习。Skywork-R1V4展示了统一多模态能力、基于真实执行轨迹的规划和交错推理的有效性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in multimodal agentic systems, existing approaches often treat image manipulation and web search as disjoint capabilities, rely heavily on costly reinforcement learning, and lack planning grounded in real tool-execution traces. To address these limitations, we present Skywork-R1V4, a 30B (A3B) parameter multimodal agentic model that unifies multimodal planning, active image manipulation ("thinking with images"), deep multimodal search, and, most critically, interleaved reasoning that dynamically alternates between visual operations and external knowledge retrieval. Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories and validated through stepwise consistency filtering, Skywork-R1V4 achieves state-of-the-art results across perception and multimodal search benchmarks: it scores 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics. Skywork-R1V4 exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning at inference time, successfully orchestrating more than 10 tool calls to solve complex, multi-step tasks. Our results demonstrate that sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved through carefully curated supervised learning alone, without any reliance on reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Object-goal navigation in open-vocabulary settings requires agents to locate novel objects in unseen environments, yet existing approaches suffer from opaque decision-making processes and low success rate on locating unseen objects. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) are trained on diverse corpora and tasks, leading them to develop complementary strengths. Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a popular way to leverage these strengths for robust reasoning, though it has mostly been applied to language-only tasks, leaving its efficacy on multimodal problems underexplored. In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty. Our results show that WISE consistently improves accuracy by 2-7% over the state-of-the-art MAD setups and aggregation methods across diverse multimodal tasks and LLM configurations.

Abstract: Automatic 3D reconstruction of indoor spaces from 2D floor plans requires high-precision semantic segmentation of structural elements, particularly walls. However, existing methods optimized for standard metrics often struggle to detect thin structural components and yield masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision required for subsequent vectorization. To address this issue, we introduce MitUNet, a hybrid neural network architecture specifically designed for wall segmentation tasks in the context of 3D modeling. In MitUNet, we utilize a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for precise boundary recovery. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy based on the Tversky loss function to effectively balance precision and recall. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the loss function, we prioritize the suppression of false positive noise along wall boundaries while maintaining high sensitivity to thin structures. Our experiments on the public CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures the generation of structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models. MitUNet provides a robust tool for data preparation in automated 3D reconstruction pipelines.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) has emerged as a prevalent paradigm for downstream adaptation, yet it faces a critical trade-off between domain specificity and domain generalization (DG) ability. Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration. To better evaluate few-shot DG, we construct ImageNet-DG from ImageNet and its variants. Extensive experiments on standard DG benchmarks and ImageNet-DG demonstrate that GuiDG improves upon state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Vision Language Models, the focus of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent tasks shifts from single-screen tasks to complex screen navigation challenges. However, real-world GUI environments, such as PC software and mobile Apps, are often complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain the comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation. This limitation hinders systematic investigation and benchmarking of agent navigation capabilities. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs, while providing full access to environment information for comprehensive agent training and evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance. We validate our methods on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating that our findings generalize effectively to real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning approaches in GUI navigation and offer practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding short clips. However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出LightHCG，一个基于因果表示的轻量级青光眼检测模型，使用卷积VAE和因果表示学习，在减少93~99%参数的同时实现高性能分类


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI驱动的青光眼检测方法在可靠性、参数使用效率、虚假相关性以及临床应用（如干预分析）方面仍有改进空间，需要更轻量且能捕捉真实因果关系的模型

Method: 提出LightHCG模型：基于卷积VAE的潜在青光眼表示模型，使用HSIC（希尔伯特-施密特独立性准则）进行潜在空间解耦，结合图自编码器进行无监督因果表示学习

Result: LightHCG在青光眼分类任务中表现出更高性能，同时参数数量比InceptionV3、MobileNetV2、VGG16等先进视觉模型减少93~99%，并增强了AI驱动干预分析的可能性

Conclusion: LightHCG通过因果表示学习提供了一种轻量、高效且更具解释性的青光眼检测方法，为临床干预分析和模拟应用开辟了新途径

Abstract: As a representative optic degenerative condition, glaucoma has been a threat to millions due to its irreversibility and severe impact on human vision fields. Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种结合动量自蒸馏和梯度累积的方法，在医疗视觉语言模型中同时解决计算效率和知识利用问题，实现单GPU高效训练并保持SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域标注数据稀缺，需要鲁棒的视觉语言模型。对比学习训练需要大批量，计算成本高，限制了资源有限机构的使用。同时，在数据有限的情况下，需要更好地从数据和模型中提取知识。

Method: 结合动量方法和蒸馏技术：1) 利用动量自蒸馏增强多模态学习；2) 将动量机制与梯度累积结合，在不增加资源消耗的情况下扩大有效批量大小。

Result: 在零样本分类中达到与SOTA方法竞争的性能，在少样本适应中显著提升（超过90% AUC-ROC），检索任务提升2-3%。使用单GPU实现高效训练，保持合理训练时间。

Conclusion: 该方法通过减少资源需求同时提升性能，推动了高效多模态学习的发展，使资源有限机构也能训练高质量的医疗视觉语言模型。

Abstract: In medical healthcare, obtaining detailed annotations is challenging, highlighting the need for robust Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time. Our approach aims to advance efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods. The implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/phphuc612/MSD .

TL;DR: BOLT框架通过从现有微调模型中提取正交任务谱基，在新任务上仅训练少量对角系数，实现高效迁移学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有元学习方法需要额外的元训练阶段，计算成本高且不稳定。同时，任务特定的预训练模型数量不断增长，但如何以最小额外训练将它们迁移到新任务仍未被充分探索。

Method: BOLT框架分为离线阶段和在线阶段：离线阶段从多个任务向量中收集主导奇异方向并正交化形成可重用基；在线阶段冻结这些基，仅训练每层的小对角系数集，实现秩可控更新。

Result: BOLT提供了强大的免训练初始化（通过池化源任务系数）和轻量级重缩放步骤，同时实现了参数高效微调路径，在实验中相比常见PEFT基线和代表性元学习初始化获得稳健性能。

Conclusion: 将适应约束在任务信息正交子空间为未见任务迁移提供了有效替代方案，BOLT框架在数据有限和计算预算紧张的情况下实现了高效模型重用。

Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained models to unseen tasks under tight data and compute budgets remains challenging. Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE)增强SNN的时序建模能力，包含Spiking Encoder生成多样化输入刺激和Attention Gating Module引导生成，并引入Spike-Driven Attention降低注意力能耗，在目标检测任务中取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNN通常直接复制输入或按固定间隔聚合为帧，导致神经元在不同时间步接收几乎相同的刺激，严重限制了模型表达能力，特别是在目标检测等复杂任务中。

Method: 提出Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE)，包含两个模块：1) Spiking Encoder (SE)生成跨时间步的多样化输入刺激；2) Attention Gating Module (AGM)基于时间间依赖关系指导SE生成。此外，提出Spike-Driven Attention (SDA)消除AGM引入的高能耗乘法操作。

Result: TDE可无缝集成到现有SNN检测器中，在静态PASCAL VOC数据集上达到57.7% mAP50-95，在神经形态EvDET200K数据集上达到47.6%。SDA能耗仅为传统注意力模块的0.240倍。

Conclusion: TDE通过增强SNN的时序信息建模能力，解决了现有方法中神经元刺激单一的问题，同时通过SDA显著降低了注意力机制的能量消耗，为SNN在复杂视觉任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their brain-inspired spatiotemporal dynamics and spike-driven computation, have emerged as promising energy-efficient alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset. In terms of energy consumption, the SDA consumes only 0.240 times the energy of conventional attention modules.

Motivation: 自动驾驶和高级驾驶辅助系统依赖深度学习，而深度学习需要大量标注数据。nuScenes作为最广泛使用的自动驾驶数据集之一，体现了AV开发的关键趋势，但许多技术细节尚未在学术出版物中公开。本文旨在深入探讨nuScenes的创建过程、技术细节及其对整个领域的影响。

Conclusion: nuScenes不仅是自动驾驶领域的关键数据集，还定义了行业标准，推动了多模态传感器融合、标准化基准和广泛任务范围的发展。该数据集对自动驾驶研究社区产生了深远影响，为后续数据集和方法发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have been revolutionized by Deep Learning. As a data-driven approach, Deep Learning relies on vast amounts of driving data, typically labeled in great detail. As a result, datasets, alongside hardware and algorithms, are foundational building blocks for the development of AVs. In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D布局估计模型主要在合成数据集上训练，只能处理单房间或单楼层环境，无法处理大型多楼层建筑，需要分割场景处理，这移除了楼梯等连接多层的结构推理所需的全局空间上下文

Method: 引入HouseLayout3D真实世界基准，支持全建筑尺度布局估计；提出MultiFloor3D训练免费基线，利用最新场景理解方法

Result: MultiFloor3D在HouseLayout3D基准和先前数据集上都优于现有3D布局估计模型

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究全建筑尺度布局估计，HouseLayout3D基准和MultiFloor3D基线为此方向提供了支持

Abstract: Current 3D layout estimation models are primarily trained on synthetic datasets containing simple single room or single floor environments. As a consequence, they cannot natively handle large multi floor buildings and require scenes to be split into individual floors before processing, which removes global spatial context that is essential for reasoning about structures such as staircases that connect multiple levels. In this work, we introduce HouseLayout3D, a real world benchmark designed to support progress toward full building scale layout estimation, including multiple floors and architecturally intricate spaces. We also present MultiFloor3D, a simple training free baseline that leverages recent scene understanding methods and already outperforms existing 3D layout estimation models on both our benchmark and prior datasets, highlighting the need for further research in this direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClusterStyle：基于聚类的框架，通过原型建模风格多样性，解决现有风格化运动生成模型难以捕捉同一风格内多样性的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风格化运动生成模型虽然能从风格运动中理解特定风格信息并插入内容运动，但难以捕捉同一风格内的多样性（intra-style diversity），即单一风格应对应多种运动变化

Method: 提出聚类框架ClusterStyle，使用原型集而非非结构化嵌入来建模同一风格类别中运动的多样化风格模式。考虑两种风格多样性：全局级（同一类别风格运动间）和局部级（运动序列时间动态内）。构建全局和局部两个结构化风格嵌入空间，通过与非学习原型锚点对齐进行优化。使用风格调制适配器（SMA）增强预训练文本到运动生成模型以集成风格特征

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在风格化运动生成和运动风格迁移任务上优于现有最先进模型

Conclusion: ClusterStyle通过原型建模风格多样性，有效解决了现有模型在捕捉同一风格内多样性方面的局限性，在风格化运动生成和风格迁移任务中表现出色

Abstract: Existing stylized motion generation models have shown their remarkable ability to understand specific style information from the style motion, and insert it into the content motion. However, capturing intra-style diversity, where a single style should correspond to diverse motion variations, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based framework, ClusterStyle, to address this limitation. Instead of learning an unstructured embedding from each style motion, we leverage a set of prototypes to effectively model diverse style patterns across motions belonging to the same style category. We consider two types of style diversity: global-level diversity among style motions of the same category, and local-level diversity within the temporal dynamics of motion sequences. These components jointly shape two structured style embedding spaces, i.e., global and local, optimized via alignment with non-learnable prototype anchors. Furthermore, we augment the pretrained text-to-motion generation model with the Stylistic Modulation Adapter (SMA) to integrate the style features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in stylized motion generation and motion style transfer.

TL;DR: STL是一个自训练框架，通过"先看后想"的结构化推理模板，让模型先生成视觉属性描述再进行推理，同时使用负向理由增强判别能力，有效提升VLM的多模态推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM在准确感知和稳健推理方面存在不足，而增强推理的方法通常依赖高质量思维链数据，这些数据获取成本高（人工标注、昂贵专有模型）或忽视感知能力。

Method: 提出See-Think-Learn自训练框架：1）引入结构化推理模板，要求模型先提取视觉属性（See），再基于这些属性进行推理（Think）；2）通过自训练循环让模型从自己生成的结构化理由中学习；3）加入负向理由（解释为什么某些答案是错误的）来增强判别能力。

Result: 在多个领域的实验中，STL始终优于仅基于答案或自生成推理的基线方法，定性分析也证实其生成的理由质量很高。

Conclusion: STL为增强VLM的多模态推理能力提供了一种经济有效的解决方案，通过联合改进感知和推理，并利用负向理由促进更判别性和稳健的学习。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.

TL;DR: 音频-视频联合去噪训练能提升纯视频生成质量，即使只关心视频质量本身


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索音频-视频联合去噪训练是否能够改善视频生成质量，即使我们只关注视频质量本身。现有研究表明多模态耦合有益于音频-视频同步性，但对其是否提升视频模态本身质量缺乏系统研究。

Method: 提出参数高效的AVFullDiT架构，利用预训练的文本到视频(T2V)和文本到音频(T2A)模块进行联合去噪训练。在相同设置下训练T2AV模型和T2V-only对比模型。

Result: 首次提供系统证据表明音频-视频联合去噪不仅能改善同步性，还能提升视频质量。在具有大运动和物体接触动作的挑战性子集上观察到一致改进。

Conclusion: 预测音频作为特权信号，鼓励模型内化视觉事件与其声学后果之间的因果关系，从而正则化视频动态。跨模态联合训练是开发更强、更物理基础的世界模型的有前景方法。

Abstract: Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Existing research on indoor embodied tasks typically requires agents to actively explore unknown environments and reason about the scene to achieve a specific goal. However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments verify that 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential EQA and EMN tasks.

Motivation: 现有的基于分布匹配的数据集蒸馏方法虽然高效，但往往忽略了训练过程中特征表示的演化，这限制了合成数据的表达能力并削弱了下游性能。

Method: 提出轨迹引导的数据集蒸馏(TGDD)，将分布匹配重新定义为沿模型训练轨迹的动态对齐过程。在每个训练阶段，通过对齐合成数据集和原始数据集的特征分布来捕捉演化语义，同时引入分布约束正则化来减少类别重叠。

Result: 在十个数据集上的实验表明，TGDD实现了最先进的性能，特别是在高分辨率基准测试上获得了5.0%的准确率提升，且没有增加额外的优化开销。

Conclusion: TGDD通过动态对齐特征分布的演化轨迹，使合成数据既能保持语义多样性又具有代表性，在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic ones to reduce storage and computational costs. Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency. Experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably a 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks.

Motivation: 视频世界模型在长时建模中存在时空一致性问题，现有模型由于长上下文输入的计算成本过高而难以解决，需要开发更高效的方法来提升长时生成的质量和一致性。

Method: 提出WorldPack模型，采用压缩记忆机制，包括轨迹打包（实现高上下文效率）和记忆检索（保持rollout一致性并辅助需要空间推理的长时生成）。

Result: 在专门评估长时一致性的Minecraft LoopNav基准测试中，WorldPack显著优于现有最先进模型，在空间一致性、保真度和质量方面都有明显提升。

Conclusion: WorldPack通过高效的压缩记忆机制解决了视频世界模型的长时一致性问题，在较短上下文长度下实现了更好的长时生成性能，为长时世界建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video world models have attracted significant attention for their ability to produce high-fidelity future visual observations conditioned on past observations and navigation actions. Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: G-SHARP是首个商业兼容的实时手术场景重建框架，通过基于GSplat的原生实现解决了现有方法的部署限制，为实际手术室环境提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose G-SHARP, a commercially compatible, real-time surgical scene reconstruction framework designed for minimally invasive procedures that require fast and accurate 3D modeling of deformable tissue. While recent Gaussian splatting approaches have advanced real-time endoscopic reconstruction, existing implementations often depend on non-commercial derivatives, limiting deployability. G-SHARP overcomes these constraints by being the first surgical pipeline built natively on the GSplat (Apache-2.0) differentiable Gaussian rasterizer, enabling principled deformation modeling, robust occlusion handling, and high-fidelity reconstructions on the EndoNeRF pulling benchmark. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with strong speed-accuracy trade-offs suitable for intra-operative use.

*Qianhan Feng,Zhongzhen Huang,Yakun Zhu,Xiaofan Zhang,Qi Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UCAgents提出了一种层次化多智能体框架，通过结构化证据审计实现单向收敛，解决医学视觉语言模型中的推理脱离问题，在提高诊断准确性的同时大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在医学诊断中存在推理脱离问题，即语言流畅的解释与可验证的图像证据脱节，损害临床信任。现有的多智能体框架虽然模拟多学科团队讨论来缓解单一模型偏见，但开放式讨论会放大文本噪声和计算成本，且未能将推理锚定在视觉证据上。

Method: UCAgents采用层次化多智能体框架，通过结构化证据审计强制实现单向收敛。该框架禁止立场改变，限制智能体交互为有针对性的证据验证，抑制修辞漂移同时增强视觉信号提取。引入一轮询问讨论来揭示视觉-文本不对齐的潜在风险，共同约束视觉模糊性和文本噪声。

Result: 在四个医学VQA基准测试中，UCAgents在PathVQA上达到71.3%的准确率，比最先进方法提升6.0%，同时降低87.7%的token成本。评估结果证实UCAgents在揭示更多视觉证据和避免混淆性文本干扰之间取得了平衡。

Conclusion: UCAgents通过结构化证据审计和单向收敛机制，有效解决了医学视觉语言模型中的推理脱离问题，在诊断可靠性和计算效率方面均表现出色，适合实际临床部署。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical diagnosis, yet suffer from reasoning detachment, where linguistically fluent explanations drift from verifiable image evidence, undermining clinical trust. Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出3D-SLIM掩码策略，用自适应空间注意力掩码替代因果掩码，解决3D场景理解中的顺序偏见和受限注意力问题，无需修改架构或增加参数即可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景语言理解方法使用语言建模的标准解码器，依赖因果注意力掩码，这导致两个基本冲突：1) 顺序无关的3D对象之间存在顺序偏见；2) 对象-指令注意力受限，阻碍任务特定推理。

Method: 提出3D空间语言指令掩码(3D-SLIM)，包含两个关键组件：1) 几何自适应掩码，根据空间密度而非标记顺序约束注意力；2) 指令感知掩码，使对象标记能直接访问指令上下文。

Result: 在多种3D场景语言任务上取得显著性能提升，无需架构修改或额外参数，通过多个基准测试和LLM基线的广泛实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 3D-SLIM简单有效，突显了解码器设计在3D多模态推理中的关键作用，通过自适应空间注意力掩码解决了现有方法的根本限制。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene-language understanding have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D reasoning by transferring their general reasoning ability to 3D multi-modal contexts. However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.

Conclusion: YingVideo-MV是首个音乐驱动长视频生成框架，通过创新的摄像机控制和时序一致性策略，成功解决了音乐表演视频生成中摄像机运动控制的挑战，实现了高质量的音乐视频自动合成。

Abstract: While diffusion model for audio-driven avatar video generation have achieved notable process in synthesizing long sequences with natural audio-visual synchronization and identity consistency, the generation of music-performance videos with camera motions remains largely unexplored. We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于深度学习和高斯混合模型的部分到部分点集配准中特征向量在平移和旋转下的不变性问题，揭示了DeepGMR等方法在部分到部分配准中的局限性，并提出了一种基于注意力的参考点偏移层来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究基于深度学习和高斯混合模型（GMMs）的点集配准方法中，特征向量在输入点集平移和旋转下的不变性问题。特别关注DeepGMR等现有方法在部分到部分点集配准中的局限性，旨在揭示这些方法存在的问题并提出可理解的解决方案。

Method: 提出了基于注意力的参考点偏移（ARPS）层，该层使用经过充分研究的注意力模块来稳健地识别两个部分点集的共同参考点，而不是寻找重叠区域。通过这种方法获得变换不变的特征，从而增强DeepGMR及其变体UGMMReg的性能。

Result: ARPS层显著提升了DeepGMR和UGMMReg的性能。这些扩展模型甚至超越了先前使用注意力块和Transformer来提取重叠区域或共同参考点的深度学习方法。实验结果表明该方法在部分到部分点集配准中具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了基于深度学习和高斯混合模型的配准方法在部分到部分配准中的理论问题和实际局限性，提出的ARPS层通过寻找共同参考点而非重叠区域，有效解决了特征变换不变性问题。这些发现为使用深度学习和GMMs的配准方法提供了更深入的见解。

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the invariance of feature vectors for partial-to-partial point set registration under translation and rotation of input point sets, particularly in the realm of techniques based on deep learning and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg. Furthermore, these extension models outperform even prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract the overlap region or common reference points. We believe these findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs.

TL;DR: MedSeg-TTA是一个全面的医学图像分割测试时适应基准，系统评估了20种代表性方法在7种成像模态下的表现，发现不同范式在不同条件下各有优劣，强调了临床部署中方法选择的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像分割的测试时适应评估存在局限性：模态覆盖不足、任务多样性不够、方法评估不一致。需要建立一个统一的基准来系统比较不同适应方法在各种医学成像模态下的表现。

Method: 提出了MedSeg-TTA基准，包含7种成像模态（MRI、CT、超声、病理、皮肤镜、OCT、胸部X光），在统一的数据预处理、骨干网络配置和测试时协议下，评估了20种代表性适应方法，涵盖四大适应范式：输入级变换、特征级对齐、输出级正则化和先验估计。

Result: 没有单一范式在所有条件下表现最佳：输入级方法在轻度外观偏移下更稳定；特征级和输出级方法在边界相关指标上更有优势；先验方法表现出强烈的模态依赖性。许多方法在大的跨中心和跨设备偏移下性能显著下降。

Conclusion: MedSeg-TTA为测试时适应研究提供了标准化数据集、验证实现和公开排行榜，强调了临床部署中需要根据具体条件选择合适的方法，为未来开发稳健、临床可靠的测试时适应方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Test time Adaptation is a promising approach for mitigating domain shift in medical image segmentation; however, current evaluations remain limited in terms of modality coverage, task diversity, and methodological consistency. We present MedSeg-TTA, a comprehensive benchmark that examines twenty representative adaptation methods across seven imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, and chest X-ray, under fully unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test time protocols. The benchmark encompasses four significant adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation, enabling the first systematic cross-modality comparison of their reliability and applicability. The results show that no single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts. Feature-level and Output-level methods offer greater advantages in boundary-related metrics, whereas prior-based methods exhibit strong modality dependence. Several methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts, which highlights the importance of principled method selection for clinical deployment. MedSeg-TTA provides standardized datasets, validated implementations, and a public leaderboard, establishing a rigorous foundation for future research on robust, clinically reliable test-time adaptation.

Abstract: Document Layout Parsing serves as a critical gateway for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to access and interpret the world's vast stores of structured knowledge. This process,which encompasses layout detection, text recognition, and relational understanding, is particularly crucial for empowering next-generation Vision-Language Models. Current methods, however, rely on fragmented, multi-stage pipelines that suffer from error propagation and fail to leverage the synergies of joint training. In this paper, we introduce dots.ocr, a single Vision-Language Model that, for the first time, demonstrates the advantages of jointly learning three core tasks within a unified, end-to-end framework. This is made possible by a highly scalable data engine that synthesizes a vast multilingual corpus, empowering the model to deliver robust performance across a wide array of tasks, encompassing diverse languages, layouts, and domains. The efficacy of our unified paradigm is validated by state-of-the-art performance on the comprehensive OmniDocBench. Furthermore, to catalyze research in global document intelligence, we introduce XDocParse, a challenging new benchmark spanning 126 languages. On this testbed, dots.ocr establishes a powerful new baseline, outperforming the next-best competitor by a remarkable +7.4 point margin and proving its unparalleled multilingual capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型与地理空间理解的并行本质存在结构错位，强制将场景转化为刚性序列叙事，阻碍了结构化、连贯输出的生成。需要重新思考地理空间生成的范式。

Method: 将地理空间生成重构为并行细化过程，实现整体粗到细合成，同时解析所有语义元素。引入GeoDiT——首个面向地理空间领域的扩散视觉语言模型。

Result: GeoDiT在需要结构化、以对象为中心输出的基准测试中建立了新的最先进水平。在图像描述、视觉定位和多目标检测等任务上取得显著提升，这些正是自回归模型表现不佳的任务。

Conclusion: 将生成过程与数据内在结构对齐是解锁复杂地理空间分析中卓越性能的关键。并行细化方法比自回归序列方法更适合地理空间理解。

Abstract: Autoregressive models are structurally misaligned with the inherently parallel nature of geospatial understanding, forcing a rigid sequential narrative onto scenes and fundamentally hindering the generation of structured and coherent outputs. We challenge this paradigm by reframing geospatial generation as a parallel refinement process, enabling a holistic, coarse-to-fine synthesis that resolves all semantic elements simultaneously. To operationalize this, we introduce GeoDiT, the first diffusion-based vision-language model tailored for the geospatial domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoDiT establishes a new state-of-the-art on benchmarks requiring structured, object-centric outputs. It achieves significant gains in image captioning, visual grounding, and multi-object detection, precisely the tasks where autoregressive models falter. Our work validates that aligning the generative process with the data's intrinsic structure is key to unlocking superior performance in complex geospatial analysis.

Motivation: 单图像超分辨率（SISR）在计算机视觉中仍然是一个难题，需要更有效的解决方案。传统方法可能无法充分学习丰富的视觉表示，因此探索自监督预训练与Transformer架构结合的方法。

Method: 提出ViT-SR方法，采用两阶段训练策略：1）自监督预训练阶段，在着色任务上学习通用视觉表示；2）微调阶段，针对4倍超分辨率任务调整模型。通过预测高频残差图像添加到初始双三次插值结果中，简化残差学习。

Conclusion: 两阶段训练策略和自监督预训练对于复杂图像恢复任务具有显著效果，展示了视觉Transformer在超分辨率任务中的潜力。未来可通过更大ViT架构或不同预训练任务进一步提升性能。

Abstract: In computer vision, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is still a difficult problem. We present ViT-SR, a new technique to improve the performance of a Vision Transformer (ViT) employing a two-stage training strategy. In our method, the model learns rich, generalizable visual representations from the data itself through a self-supervised pretraining phase on a colourization task. The pre-trained model is then adjusted for 4x super-resolution. By predicting the addition of a high-frequency residual image to an initial bicubic interpolation, this design simplifies residual learning. ViT-SR, trained and evaluated on the DIV2K benchmark dataset, achieves an impressive SSIM of 0.712 and PSNR of 22.90 dB. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our two-stage approach and highlight the potential of self-supervised pre-training for complex image restoration tasks. Further improvements may be possible with larger ViT architectures or alternative pretext tasks.

Abstract: The emergence of large vision-language models (VLMs) has significantly enhanced the efficiency and flexibility of geospatial interpretation. However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on 21 public datasets demonstrate that SkyMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks, validating its adaptability, scalability, and superior multi-granularity understanding in remote sensing.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation (AC/AS) aim to detect anomalous samples and regions without any training data, a capability increasingly crucial in industrial inspection and medical imaging. This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.
  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.
  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.
  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.
  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法缓解了泛化崩溃问题，能够在多样化任务上实现稳定的持续学习

Conclusion: Noisy Query Tokens方法有效解决了MLLM中VLM与扩散模型桥接时的任务泛化崩溃问题，支持稳定的跨任务持续学习

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has highlighted the challenge of efficiently bridging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Diffusion Models. While methods using a fixed number of learnable query tokens offer computational efficiency, they suffer from task generalization collapse, failing to adapt to new tasks that are distant from their pre-training tasks. To overcome this, we propose Noisy Query Tokens, which learn a distributed representation space between the VLM and Diffusion Model via end-to-end optimization, enhancing continual learning. Additionally, we introduce a VAE branch with linear projection to recover fine-grained image details. Experimental results confirm our approach mitigates generalization collapse and enables stable continual learning across diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的两步加速方案，通过分析VGGT和π³模型中全局注意力模块的角色，将早期全局层转换为帧注意力，并对全局注意力进行子采样，实现8-10倍推理加速，同时保持或略微提升原始模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图3D模型（如VGGT和π³）严重依赖全局自注意力机制，导致计算成本高昂。现有的稀疏注意力变体只能提供部分加速，且缺乏对全局注意力在多视图推理中作用的系统性分析。

Method: 首先深入分析VGGT和π³中全局注意力模块的角色，发现交替全局帧架构中的明确分工：早期全局层不形成有意义的对应关系，中间层执行跨视图对齐，最后层仅提供微小细化。基于这些发现，提出无需训练的两步加速方案：1）将早期全局层转换为帧注意力；2）通过子采样K/V对全局注意力进行子采样，同时保留对角线并添加均值填充组件。

Result: 在标准姿态和点云基准测试中，该方法实现了8-10倍的推理时间加速，同时匹配或略微提升了原始模型的精度。即使在先前稀疏注意力基线失败的极端密集多视图设置中，该方法仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过系统分析全局注意力在多视图3D模型中的作用，提出了一种高效的无训练加速方案，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了模型性能，为多视图推理的高效实现提供了新思路。

Abstract: Since DUSt3R, models such as VGGT and $π^3$ have shown strong multi-view 3D performance, but their heavy reliance on global self-attention results in high computational cost. Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $π^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $π^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks. Our method achieves up to $8$-$10\times$ speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving the accuracy of the original models, and remains robust even in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail.

Motivation: 现有视频对象分割方法通常将复杂的动态、因果和时序交互推理简化为潜在嵌入的单一预测，导致推理链不透明且难以追踪。需要更显式的分解方法来处理这些复杂的推理任务。

Method: ReVSeg采用显式分解视角，在预训练视觉语言模型的原生接口中执行三步推理操作：语义解释、时序证据选择和空间定位。使用强化学习优化多步推理链，让模型能够从结果驱动的信号中自我优化决策质量。

Result: 在标准视频对象分割基准测试中达到最先进性能，并产生可解释的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过显式分解和强化学习优化的多步推理方法能够有效处理视频对象分割中的复杂推理任务，提供透明且可追踪的推理过程，同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Reasoning-centric video object segmentation is an inherently complex task: the query often refers to dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions, rather than static appearances. Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

TL;DR: OmniPerson是一个统一的身份保持行人生成框架，支持RGB/IR模态的图像/视频生成，通过多参考图像融合确保身份一致性，并创建了PersonSyn数据集用于数据增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行人重识别任务面临高质量训练数据不足的问题，现有数据生成方法存在身份一致性差和可控性不足的缺陷，限制了数据增强的效果。

Method: 提出OmniPerson统一生成模型：1）支持RGB/IR模态图像/视频生成，具有细粒度属性控制；2）设计多参考融合器，从多视角参考图像中提取统一身份特征；3）创建PersonSyn数据集及其自动化标注流程。

Result: OmniPerson在行人生成任务中达到SOTA水平，在视觉保真度和身份一致性方面表现优异。使用生成数据增强现有数据集能持续提升ReID模型性能。

Conclusion: OmniPerson为可见光/红外图像/视频ReID任务提供了首个统一的身份保持行人生成框架，解决了数据不足问题，并将开源代码、预训练模型和PersonSyn数据集。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) suffers from a lack of large-scale high-quality training data due to challenges in data privacy and annotation costs. While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models. We will open-source the full codebase, pretrained model, and the PersonSyn dataset.

TL;DR: Panel2Patch：一种从生物医学文献中挖掘多层次视觉-语言对齐数据的新方法，通过解析图表结构构建从整体到局部的多层次监督信号，显著提升生物医学视觉-语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生物医学视觉-语言预训练通常将丰富的科学图表和文本压缩为粗略的图表级配对，丢弃了临床医生实际依赖的细粒度对应关系。需要一种能够保留局部语义的方法来提升模型性能。

Method: Panel2Patch数据管道：1）解析科学图表的布局、面板和视觉标记；2）构建图表、面板和补丁三个层次的对齐视觉-语言对；3）开发粒度感知的预训练策略，统一从粗略教学描述到精细区域聚焦短语的异构目标。

Result: 仅使用少量文献图表，Panel2Pipeline提取的监督信号比现有方法更有效，使用更少的预训练数据实现了显著更好的性能。

Conclusion: 通过挖掘生物医学文献中的层次结构并构建多粒度监督，Panel2Patch能够显著提升生物医学视觉-语言模型的表示能力，为细粒度医学图像理解提供了新途径。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in developing strong biomedical vision-language models. A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用音频-运动特征距离或共享特征空间进行一对一映射，无法处理语音与手势之间的多对多映射关系，导致生成的同步手势视频不够自然

Method: 1) 使用扩散模型学习音频与运动的联合分布，从输入音频生成上下文合适的手势动作；2) 从音频提取低层和高层特征丰富扩散模型训练；3) 设计基于运动的检索算法，通过全局和局部相似性评估在图结构中找到最佳路径；4) 对不连续节点进行无缝拼接生成连贯视频

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在同步准确性和手势自然度方面显著优于先前方法

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过扩散模型学习音频-手势联合分布，结合多级特征提取和运动图检索，有效解决了语音-手势多对多映射问题，生成了更同步自然的手势视频

Abstract: Synthesizing synchronized and natural co-speech gesture videos remains a formidable challenge. Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的图像中心化攻击方法CIA，通过多智能体系统将有害查询嵌入看似良性的视觉上下文中，显著提高了对多模态大语言模型的越狱成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型安全对齐方法主要关注文本-图像交互，将视觉模态视为次要提示，未能充分利用图像承载复杂上下文信息的独特潜力，因此需要开发更有效的图像中心化攻击方法。

Method: 提出Contextual Image Attack (CIA)方法，采用多智能体系统，通过四种不同的可视化策略将有害查询嵌入看似良性的视觉上下文中，并融入上下文元素增强和自动毒性混淆技术来提升攻击效果。

Result: 在MMSafetyBench-tiny数据集上的实验结果显示，CIA对GPT-4o和Qwen2.5-VL-72B模型的毒性分数分别达到4.73和4.83，攻击成功率分别达到86.31%和91.07%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 视觉模态本身是越狱先进多模态大语言模型的有效载体，CIA方法通过充分利用图像的复杂上下文信息，显著提升了攻击效果，揭示了当前安全对齐的脆弱性。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their safety alignments are susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing attack methods typically focus on text-image interplay, treating the visual modality as a secondary prompt. This approach underutilizes the unique potential of images to carry complex, contextual information. To address this gap, we propose a new image-centric attack method, Contextual Image Attack (CIA), which employs a multi-agent system to subtly embeds harmful queries into seemingly benign visual contexts using four distinct visualization strategies. To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques. Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\% and 91.07\%. Our method significantly outperforms prior work, demonstrating that the visual modality itself is a potent vector for jailbreaking advanced MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将纹理映射与高斯泼溅结合的方法，通过自适应调整纹理分辨率来高效表示场景细节，减少所需的高斯基元数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯泼溅已成为3D重建和实时渲染的主流方法，但精细外观细节需要大量小高斯基元表示，当几何和外观具有不同频率特性时会造成资源浪费。受传统纹理映射启发，希望用纹理来表示细节外观。

Method: 提出基于2D高斯基元的纹理映射表示方法，根据图像采样频率限制纹理像素大小，并在优化过程中自适应调整纹理分辨率（上采样或下采样）。同时基于纹理分辨率控制优化过程中的基元数量。

Result: 与替代的纹理化高斯基元解决方案相比，该方法在图像质量和总参数数量方面表现更优，实现了更高效的场景表示。

Conclusion: 通过将纹理映射与高斯泼溅相结合，实现了对场景细节的高效表示，减少了所需基元数量，在保持图像质量的同时优化了参数使用效率。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become the method of choice for 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering of captured real scenes. However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.
  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

TL;DR: RULER-Bench是一个专门评估视频生成模型推理能力的新基准，覆盖40个任务和6个规则类别，发现当前最先进模型在规则一致性指标上仅达到48.87%，显示视频模型在推理能力方面仍有很大提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成评估基准主要关注视觉感知和理解方面（如视觉美学、指令遵循、时间一致性），但视频生成模型的基于规则的推理能力尚未得到充分探索。虽然近期研究初步探索了视频模型作为零样本学习者的能力，但仍缺乏对推理能力的细粒度分解和全面评估方案。

Method: 构建RULER-Bench基准，基于文本到视频和图像到视频两种基本范式，涵盖6个规则类别的40个代表性任务，包含622个高质量标注实例。为每个生成的视频构建包含四个指标的检查表，利用GPT-4o进行评分，与人类判断的一致性达到85%。

Result: 广泛实验表明，当前最先进的视频生成模型在规则一致性指标上仅达到48.87%，表明下一代视频模型在推理能力方面仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: RULER-Bench的见解将促进推理感知视频生成的进一步发展，推动视频生成模型朝着视觉基础智能的方向前进。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of videos with strong temporal consistency and impressive visual quality, marking a crucial step toward vision foundation models. To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models. We expect that the insight obtained from RULER-Bench will facilitate further development of reasoning-aware video generation, advancing video generation models toward vision foundation intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPTBench是一个评估多模态大语言模型在PowerPoint相关任务上表现的基准测试，涵盖检测、理解、修改和生成四大类别，揭示了当前模型在视觉布局推理方面的显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PowerPoint演示文稿结合了丰富的文本内容和结构化视觉布局，是评估现代多模态大语言模型多模态推理和布局理解能力的理想测试平台。然而，现有基准测试仅关注狭窄的子任务，忽略了布局中心挑战，而这些挑战对于现实世界的幻灯片创建和编辑至关重要。

Method: 引入PPTBench，这是一个全面的多模态基准测试，用于评估LLMs在PowerPoint相关任务上的表现。利用958个PPTX文件的多样化来源，PPTBench在四个类别中评估模型，包含4,439个样本：检测、理解、修改和生成。

Result: 实验揭示了当前MLLMs在语义理解和视觉布局推理之间存在显著差距：模型能够解释幻灯片内容，但无法产生连贯的空间排列。消融和进一步分析表明，当前MLLMs难以将视觉线索与基于JSON的布局结构相结合，并且无法将视觉信息整合到其API规划能力中。案例研究直观地暴露了系统性布局错误，如错位和元素重叠。

Conclusion: 这些发现为在PPT场景中评估VLLMs提供了新的视角，突出了视觉结构推理和连贯幻灯片生成未来研究的挑战和方向。所有数据集和代码都已完全发布，以支持可重复性和未来研究。

Abstract: PowerPoint presentations combine rich textual content with structured visual layouts, making them a natural testbed for evaluating the multimodal reasoning and layout understanding abilities of modern MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks focus solely on narrow subtasks while overlooking layout-centric challenges, which are central to real-world slide creation and editing. To bridge this gap, we introduce PPTBench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs on PowerPoint-related tasks. Leveraging a diverse source of 958 PPTX files, PPTBench evaluates models across four categories with 4,439 samples, including Detection, Understanding, Modification, and Generation. Our experiments reveal a substantial gap between semantic understanding and visual-layout reasoning in current MLLMs: models can interpret slide content but fail to produce coherent spatial arrangements. Ablation and further analysis show that current MLLMs struggle to combine visual cues with JSON-based layout structures and fail to integrate visual information into their API planning ability. And case studies visually expose systematic layout errors such as misalignment and element overlap. These findings provides a new perspective on evaluating VLLMs in PPT scenarios, highlighting challenges and directions for future research on visual-structural reasoning and coherent slide generation. All datasets and code are fully released to support reproducibility and future research.

<details>

Motivation: 现有深度学习遥感图像融合方法在未见数据集上泛化能力差，主要受限于真实训练数据稀缺和不同卫星传感器间的域差异。

Method: 通过多种退化操作（模糊、噪声、下采样）和增强技术（波段生成、通道混洗、高通滤波、颜色抖动等）构建大规模模拟数据集，在ImageNet和SkyScript图像上预训练融合模型，学习通用空间-光谱表示。

Result: 在六个数据集（WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2）上评估，使用零样本和单样本范式，预训练策略显著提升不同网络架构（CNN、Transformer、Mamba）的泛化性能，在零样本场景取得优异结果，在单样本设置中展示卓越适应能力。

Conclusion: 该工作为跨域全色锐化提供了实用解决方案，建立了遥感图像融合任务泛化能力的新基准，通过先进训练策略为利用基础模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Existing deep learning methods for remote sensing image fusion often suffer from poor generalization when applied to unseen datasets due to the limited availability of real training data and the domain gap between different satellite sensors. To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings. Our work provides a practical solution for cross-domain pansharpening, establishes a new benchmark for generalization in remote sensing image fusion tasks, and paves the way for leveraging foundation models through advanced training strategies.

TL;DR: 提出SelVA模型，解决文本条件选择性视频到音频生成任务，能从多对象视频中仅生成用户指定的声音，而非混合所有声源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多媒体制作中需要对每个声源单独处理音频轨道以实现精确编辑、混音和创意控制，但现有方法只能一次性生成混合所有声源的声音，因为视觉特征纠缠且区域提示往往无法准确指定声源。

Method: 提出SelVA模型，将文本提示作为目标声源的显式选择器，调制视频编码器以提取与提示相关的视频特征；使用补充token通过抑制文本无关激活来促进跨注意力；采用自增强方案克服单声道音频监督数据不足的问题。

Result: 在VGG-MONOAUDIO基准测试上，SelVA在音频质量、语义对齐和时间同步方面均表现出色，实验和消融研究一致验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SelVA成功实现了文本条件选择性视频到音频生成，为多媒体制作提供了精确的声源分离和控制能力，解决了现有方法只能生成混合声音的局限性。

Abstract: This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization. Code and demo are available at https://jnwnlee.github.io/selva-demo/.

*Agathoklis Georgiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉语言模型和OCR的混合架构，利用ColPali的patch级相似度分数作为空间相关性过滤器，精确定位文档中的相关区域而非整页。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（如ColPali）虽然能实现细粒度文档检索，但只能返回整页而非具体区域，限制了检索增强生成（RAG）的实用性。而OCR系统虽然能提取带坐标的结构化文本，但缺乏语义相关性评估能力。

Method: 提出混合架构，统一两种范式：使用ColPali的patch级相似度分数作为空间相关性过滤器，应用于OCR提取的区域。形式化视觉transformer patch网格与OCR边界框之间的坐标映射，引入交集度量进行相关性传播，建立检索精度的理论边界。

Result: 方法在推理时无需额外训练。发布了开源实现Snappy，展示了实际应用性，正在进行实证评估。

Conclusion: 通过结合视觉语言模型的语义理解能力和OCR的空间定位能力，实现了更精确的文档区域检索，为检索增强生成提供了更好的上下文精确性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like ColPali achieve state-of-the-art document retrieval by embedding pages as images and computing fine-grained similarity between query tokens and visual patches. However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training. We release Snappy, an open-source implementation demonstrating practical applicability, with empirical evaluation ongoing.

TL;DR: PolarGuide-GSDR：首个将偏振先验直接嵌入3D高斯溅射优化的框架，通过偏振与3DGS的双向耦合机制，实现高保真反射分离和全场景重建，无需环境贴图或材料假设，保持实时渲染能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：基于NeRF的偏振感知方法训练慢、渲染效率低、依赖材料/视角假设；3DGS虽能实时渲染但难以准确重建反射（反射-几何纠缠问题），添加延迟反射模块又引入环境贴图依赖。需要解决这些限制。

Method: 提出偏振前向引导范式PolarGuide-GSDR，建立偏振与3DGS的双向耦合机制：1) 利用3DGS的几何先验解决偏振歧义；2) 使用精炼的偏振信息线索指导3DGS的法线和球谐表示。无需环境贴图或限制性材料假设。

Result: 在公开和自采集数据集上，PolarGuide-GSDR在镜面反射重建、法线估计和新视角合成方面达到最先进性能，同时保持实时渲染能力。是首个将偏振先验直接嵌入3DGS优化的框架。

Conclusion: PolarGuide-GSDR通过偏振与3DGS的双向耦合，成功解决了反射-几何纠缠问题，实现了高保真反射分离和全场景重建，为复杂反射场景建模提供了优越的可解释性和实时性能。

Abstract: Polarization-aware Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) enable novel view synthesis of specular-reflection scenes but face challenges in slow training, inefficient rendering, and strong dependencies on material/viewpoint assumptions. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering yet struggles with accurate reflection reconstruction from reflection-geometry entanglement, adding a deferred reflection module introduces environment map dependence. We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation. This process achieves high-fidelity reflection separation and full-scene reconstruction without requiring environment maps or restrictive material assumptions. We demonstrate on public and self-collected datasets that PolarGuide-GSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis, all while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities. To our knowledge, this is the first framework embedding polarization priors directly into 3DGS optimization, yielding superior interpretability and real-time performance for modeling complex reflective scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAUTrack是一个统一的反无人机单目标跟踪框架，采用单流单阶段端到端架构，通过文本先验提示策略有效整合多种模态，在多个反无人机数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前反无人机跟踪研究缺乏统一的跨模态协作框架，现有方法主要关注独立任务模型，忽视了跨模态信息共享的潜力，且反无人机跟踪技术仍处于起步阶段，现有解决方案难以实现有效的多模态数据融合。

Method: 提出UAUTrack框架，采用单流、单阶段、端到端架构，核心创新是文本先验提示策略，引导模型在不同场景下专注于无人机目标，有效整合RGB、TIR等多种模态信息。

Result: 在Anti-UAV和DUT Anti-UAV数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在Anti-UAV410数据集上保持了精度与速度的良好平衡，展示了在各种反无人机场景下的高精度和实际效率。

Conclusion: UAUTrack提供了一个有效的统一反无人机跟踪解决方案，通过创新的文本提示策略解决了多模态融合挑战，为反无人机跟踪领域提供了新的研究方向和实用框架。

Abstract: Research in Anti-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) tracking has explored various modalities, including RGB, TIR, and RGB-T fusion. However, a unified framework for cross-modal collaboration is still lacking. Existing approaches have primarily focused on independent models for individual tasks, often overlooking the potential for cross-modal information sharing. Furthermore, Anti-UAV tracking techniques are still in their infancy, with current solutions struggling to achieve effective multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose UAUTrack, a unified single-target tracking framework built upon a single-stream, single-stage, end-to-end architecture that effectively integrates multiple modalities. UAUTrack introduces a key component: a text prior prompt strategy that directs the model to focus on UAVs across various scenarios. Experimental results show that UAUTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Anti-UAV and DUT Anti-UAV datasets, and maintains a favourable trade-off between accuracy and speed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset, demonstrating both high accuracy and practical efficiency across diverse Anti-UAV scenarios.

TL;DR: PGP-DiffSR：基于相位引导的轻量级扩散超分辨率方法，通过渐进剪枝和相位交换适配器减少计算和内存开销，同时保持恢复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的图像超分辨率方法通常依赖大规模骨干网络（如SDXL、DiT），导致训练和推理时计算和内存成本过高，需要开发轻量级解决方案。

Method: 1) 识别扩散骨干网络中的块内冗余，提出渐进剪枝方法去除冗余块同时保留恢复能力；2) 提出相位交换适配器模块，利用输入图像的相位信息引导剪枝后的扩散模型获得更好的恢复性能；3) 将渐进剪枝和相位交换适配器统一为一个完整模型。

Conclusion: PGP-DiffSR通过结合渐进剪枝和相位引导，成功开发了一个轻量级但有效的扩散超分辨率方法，平衡了计算效率和恢复性能。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models have achieved impressive results in image super-resolution, they often rely on large-scale backbones such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which lead to excessive computational and memory costs during training and inference. To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly reducing computational load and memory consumption.

TL;DR: FASA是一个两阶段的前景感知槽注意力框架，通过显式分离前景和背景来改进无监督物体发现，使用双槽竞争机制和伪掩码指导来解决背景干扰和过分割问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有槽注意力方法通常不加区分地处理前景和背景区域，导致背景干扰和真实世界数据上的实例发现性能不佳。需要显式分离前景和背景以实现精确的物体发现。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段通过双槽竞争机制和基于聚类的初始化进行粗粒度场景分解，区分前景和背景；第二阶段引入掩码槽注意力机制，第一个槽捕获背景，其余槽竞争表示单个前景物体。使用自监督图像特征构建的补丁亲和力图生成伪掩码指导来引导前景槽学习。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，FASA始终优于最先进的方法，验证了显式前景建模和伪掩码指导对于鲁棒场景分解和物体一致表示的有效性。

Conclusion: FASA通过显式分离前景和背景，结合伪掩码指导，有效解决了背景干扰和前景过分割问题，显著提升了无监督物体发现的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in object-centric representation learning have shown that slot attention-based methods can effectively decompose visual scenes into object slot representations without supervision. However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects. To further address over-segmentation of foreground objects, we incorporate pseudo-mask guidance derived from a patch affinity graph constructed with self-supervised image features to guide the learning of foreground slots. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation. Code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ClimaDrive是一个语义引导的图像到图像框架，用于合成语义连贯、天气多样且物理合理的异常驾驶数据，构建了ClimaOoD大规模基准，显著提升了异常分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常分割对于自动驾驶安全至关重要，但异常数据的稀缺性和多样性不足限制了模型在开放世界环境中的泛化能力。现有合成数据方法存在上下文连贯性和物理真实性问题，导致合成数据与真实数据之间存在领域差距。

Method: 提出ClimaDrive框架，统一结构引导的多天气生成与提示驱动的异常修复，通过语义引导的图像到图像方法合成视觉真实的训练数据。基于此构建ClimaOoD大规模基准，涵盖六种代表性驾驶场景和不同天气条件。

Result: 在四种最先进方法上的实验表明，使用ClimaOoD训练显著提升了异常分割性能。所有方法的AUROC、AP和FPR95均有明显改善，例如RbA在Fishyscapes LAF上的FPR95从3.97降至3.52。

Conclusion: ClimaOoD增强了模型鲁棒性，为开放世界异常检测提供了有价值的训练数据，能够实现更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation seeks to detect and localize unknown or out-of-distribution (OoD) objects that fall outside predefined semantic classes a capability essential for safe autonomous driving. However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation. Across all methods, AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF. These results demonstrate that ClimaOoD enhances model robustness, offering valuable training data for better generalization in open-world anomaly detection.

Motivation: 安全X射线成像中，扫描设备和环境条件的变化导致显著的域差异，这会降低目标检测模型的性能，需要有效的域适应方法来应对现实应用中的分布偏移问题。

Method: 应用ALDI++域适应框架，该框架整合了自蒸馏、特征对齐和增强训练策略，以有效缓解域偏移。在EDS数据集上进行实验，并采用Vision Transformer for Detection (ViTDet)作为骨干网络。

Conclusion: ALDI++是域适应目标检测的高效解决方案，为安全X射线图像的性能稳定性和跨域泛化能力设立了新的基准，证实了基于Transformer的架构在跨域目标检测中的有效性。

Abstract: Domain adaptation in object detection is critical for real-world applications where distribution shifts degrade model performance. Security X-ray imaging presents a unique challenge due to variations in scanning devices and environmental conditions, leading to significant domain discrepancies. To address this, we apply ALDI++, a domain adaptation framework that integrates self-distillation, feature alignment, and enhanced training strategies to mitigate domain shift effectively in this area. We conduct extensive experiments on the EDS dataset, demonstrating that ALDI++ surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) domain adaptation methods across multiple adaptation scenarios. In particular, ALDI++ with a Vision Transformer for Detection (ViTDet) backbone achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP), confirming the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for cross-domain object detection. Additionally, our category-wise analysis highlights consistent improvements in detection accuracy, reinforcing the robustness of the model across diverse object classes. Our findings establish ALDI++ as an efficient solution for domain-adaptive object detection, setting a new benchmark for performance stability and cross-domain generalization in security X-ray imagery.

TL;DR: GeoBridge是一个跨视图地理定位基础模型，通过新颖的语义锚机制实现多视图双向匹配和语言-图像检索，解决了传统卫星中心方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卫星中心的地理定位方法在高分辨率或最新卫星图像不可用时鲁棒性有限，且未能充分利用跨视图（无人机、卫星、街景）和跨模态（语言和图像）的互补线索。

Method: 提出GeoBridge基础模型，基于语义锚机制通过文本描述桥接多视图特征；构建首个大规模跨模态多视图对齐数据集GeoLoc（包含5万多对无人机、街景全景、卫星图像及文本描述）。

Result: 实验表明GeoLoc预训练显著提高了GeoBridge的地理定位精度，同时促进了跨域泛化和跨模态知识迁移。

Conclusion: GeoBridge通过语义锚机制实现了鲁棒灵活的地理定位，超越了传统卫星中心范式，支持跨视图双向匹配和语言-图像检索。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization infers a location by retrieving geo-tagged reference images that visually correspond to a query image. However, the traditional satellite-centric paradigm limits robustness when high-resolution or up-to-date satellite imagery is unavailable. It further underexploits complementary cues across views (e.g., drone, satellite, and street) and modalities (e.g., language and image). To address these challenges, we propose GeoBridge, a foundation model that performs bidirectional matching across views and supports language-to-image retrieval. Going beyond traditional satellite-centric formulations, GeoBridge builds on a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions for robust, flexible localization. In support of this task, we construct GeoLoc, the first large-scale, cross-modal, and multi-view aligned dataset comprising over 50,000 pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images as well as their textual descriptions, collected from 36 countries, ensuring both geographic and semantic alignment. We performed broad evaluations across multiple tasks. Experiments confirm that GeoLoc pre-training markedly improves geo-location accuracy for GeoBridge while promoting cross-domain generalization and cross-modal knowledge transfer. The dataset, source code, and pretrained models were released at https://github.com/MiliLab/GeoBridge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-Pruner是一种无需训练的可视化语言模型token剪枝算法，通过平衡冗余性和空间稀疏性，在保持88.9%剪枝率的同时提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型(VLMs)的视觉token数量庞大导致计算成本高，阻碍在移动设备上的部署。现有剪枝方法要么只关注token重要性而忽略token间冗余，要么忽略token间的空间关系，导致保留的token过于稀疏而无法充分覆盖目标对象区域。

Method: 提出VLM-Pruner训练免费token剪枝算法：1) 引入离心式token剪枝范式，实现从近到远的选择同时优先保留细粒度对象细节；2) 设计空间稀疏性缓冲(BSS)准则，延迟选择空间上较远的token；3) 采用并行贪婪策略高效进行token选择；4) 选择性融合被丢弃token中的显著信息到保留的token中。

Result: 在五种VLM上的综合比较表明，VLM-Pruner在88.9%的剪枝率下始终优于强基线方法，同时实现了端到端的推理加速。

Conclusion: VLM-Pruner通过显式平衡冗余性和空间稀疏性，有效解决了现有VLM token剪枝方法的局限性，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image understanding tasks, but the large number of visual tokens imposes significant computational costs, hindering deployment on mobile devices. Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup.

Motivation: UK Biobank收集了大量全身MRI影像和非影像健康数据，需要鲁棒准确的跨受试者图像配准来实现全身空间标准化，并分析非影像数据与图像衍生参数（如组织体积、脂肪含量）的相关性

Method: 提出性别分层的跨受试者全身MRI配准方法，使用VIBESegmentator生成的皮下脂肪组织和肌肉掩膜来增强基于强度的图割配准

Result: 在4000名受试者子集上评估，平均Dice分数男性0.77/女性0.75，比仅强度配准高6个百分点，比uniGradICON高8-9个百分点，比MIRTK高12-13个百分点；年龄相关性图谱噪声更少、解剖对齐更好

Conclusion: 使用两种组织掩膜的图像配准方法改善了UK Biobank图像的全身配准效果

Abstract: The UK Biobank is a large-scale study collecting whole-body MR imaging and non-imaging health data. Robust and accurate inter-subject image registration of these whole-body MR images would enable their body-wide spatial standardization, and region-/voxel-wise correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters (e.g., tissue volume or fat content). We propose a sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration approach that uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from the state-of-the-art VIBESegmentator method to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration. The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 4000 subjects by comparing it to an intensity-only method as well as two previously published registration methods, uniGradICON and MIRTK. The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research. The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK. Using the proposed method, the age-correlation maps were less noisy and showed higher anatomical alignment. In conclusion, the image registration method using two tissue masks improves whole-body registration of UK Biobank images.

Conclusion: GeoViS通过渐进式搜索推理框架有效解决了遥感图像中的小目标检测和复杂空间关系理解问题，为遥感视觉定位提供了新思路

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models(MLLMs) have led to remarkable progress in visual grounding, enabling fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual queries and image regions. However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness. Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, highlighting its strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日常手部交互中存在严重遮挡问题（如双手重叠），需要鲁棒的特征学习。现有3D手部姿态估计方法多依赖ResNet等CNN，其归纳偏置可能不适合3D HPE，因为CNN建模全局上下文的能力有限。

Method: 提出Deformable Mamba（DF-Mamba）框架，利用Mamba的选择性状态建模和提出的可变形状态扫描。对卷积后的局部特征，通过可变形扫描聚合图像特征，同时选择性保留代表全局上下文的有用线索。

Result: 在五个不同数据集（单手/双手、纯手/手物交互、RGB/深度）上全面评估。DF-Mamba在所有数据集上均优于最新图像骨干网络（包括VMamba和Spatial-Mamba），达到最先进性能，推理速度与ResNet-50相当。

Conclusion: DF-Mamba通过Mamba的选择性状态建模和可变形状态扫描，有效捕捉全局上下文线索，显著提升结构化3D手部姿态估计的准确性，为解决遮挡问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50. Our experiments involve extensive evaluations on five divergent datasets including single-hand and two-hand scenarios, hand-only and hand-object interactions, as well as RGB and depth-based estimation. DF-Mamba outperforms the latest image backbones, including VMamba and Spatial-Mamba, on all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: CAEVL通过卫星图像训练实现无人机定位，无需配对数据集，为GNSS拒止环境下的无人机自主性提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Image-based localization in GNSS-denied environments is critical for UAV autonomy. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on matching UAV images to geo-referenced satellite images; however, they typically require large-scale, paired UAV-satellite datasets for training. Such data are costly to acquire and often unavailable, limiting their applicability. To address this challenge, we adopt a training paradigm that removes the need for UAV imagery during training by learning directly from satellite-view reference images. This is achieved through a dedicated augmentation strategy that simulates the visual domain shift between satellite and real-world UAV views. We introduce CAEVL, an efficient model designed to exploit this paradigm, and validate it on ViLD, a new and challenging dataset of real-world UAV images that we release to the community. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to approaches trained with paired data, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Hate speech in online videos is posing an increasingly serious threat to digital platforms, especially as video content becomes increasingly multimodal and context-dependent. Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively. We will release the code after the anonymity period ends.

Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with a lower false positive rate, better precision recall balance, and higher IoU.

*Qifan Liang,Junlin Li,Zhen Han,Xihao Wang,Zhongyuan Wang,Bin Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出首个烟雾类型感知的腹腔镜视频去烟网络STANet，通过区分扩散烟雾和环境烟雾两种类型，结合烟雾掩码分割和视频重建子网络，在合成数据集上验证了优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腹腔镜手术中电刀或激光产生的烟雾会遮挡手术视野，现有去烟方法未能考虑不同烟雾类型（扩散烟雾和环境烟雾）的时空特性差异，需要针对性的解决方案。

Method: 提出STANet网络：1) 烟雾掩码分割子网络通过注意力加权掩码聚合预测烟雾掩码和类型；2) 无烟视频重建子网络基于两种烟雾掩码指导去烟；3) 粗到细解耦模块处理两种烟雾的纠缠问题；4) 构建首个带烟雾类型标注的大规模合成视频数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在质量评估上优于现有方法，并在多个下游手术任务中展现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过区分烟雾类型并针对性处理，STANet能有效去除腹腔镜视频中的烟雾，提升手术可视化效果，为智能手术辅助系统提供支持。

Abstract: Electrocautery or lasers will inevitably generate surgical smoke, which hinders the visual guidance of laparoscopic videos for surgical procedures. The surgical smoke can be classified into different types based on its motion patterns, leading to distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics across smoky laparoscopic videos. However, existing desmoking methods fail to account for such smoke-type-specific distinctions. Therefore, we propose the first Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Network (STANet) by introducing two smoke types: Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke. Specifically, a smoke mask segmentation sub-network is designed to jointly conduct smoke mask and smoke type predictions based on the attention-weighted mask aggregation, while a smokeless video reconstruction sub-network is proposed to perform specially desmoking on smoky features guided by two types of smoke mask. To address the entanglement challenges of two smoke types, we further embed a coarse-to-fine disentanglement module into the mask segmentation sub-network, which yields more accurate disentangled masks through the smoke-type-aware cross attention between non-entangled and entangled regions. In addition, we also construct the first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in quality evaluations, but also exhibits superior generalization across multiple downstream surgical tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LumiX是一个结构化扩散框架，用于从文本生成一致的场景内在属性图（如反照率、辐照度、法线、深度和最终颜色），通过查询广播注意力和张量LoRA实现多属性联合生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从文本生成场景内在属性时缺乏结构一致性和物理合理性，需要一种能够联合生成多种内在属性图并保持物理一致性的框架。

Method: 提出LumiX框架，包含两个关键技术：1) 查询广播注意力机制，通过在所有图中共享查询来确保结构一致性；2) 张量LoRA，通过张量化适配高效建模跨图关系，实现稳定的联合扩散训练。

Result: LumiX生成的结果具有更好的物理一致性和对齐度，比现有方法提升23%的对齐度，偏好得分从-0.41提升到0.19，同时支持图像条件的内在属性分解。

Conclusion: LumiX通过结构化扩散框架成功实现了从文本到多种内在属性图的联合生成，在保持物理一致性和结构连贯性方面优于现有方法，为场景理解和生成提供了新工具。

Abstract: We present LumiX, a structured diffusion framework for coherent text-to-intrinsic generation. Conditioned on text prompts, LumiX jointly generates a comprehensive set of intrinsic maps (e.g., albedo, irradiance, normal, depth, and final color), providing a structured and physically consistent description of an underlying scene. This is enabled by two key contributions: 1) Query-Broadcast Attention, a mechanism that ensures structural consistency by sharing queries across all maps in each self-attention block. 2) Tensor LoRA, a tensor-based adaptation that parameter-efficiently models cross-map relations for efficient joint training. Together, these designs enable stable joint diffusion training and unified generation of multiple intrinsic properties. Experiments show that LumiX produces coherent and physically meaningful results, achieving 23% higher alignment and a better preference score (0.19 vs. -0.41) compared to the state of the art, and it can also perform image-conditioned intrinsic decomposition within the same framework.

### [129] [TrackNetV5: Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement and Motion Direction Decoupling for Fast Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02789)
*Tang Haonan,Chen Yanjun,Jiang Lezhi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrackNetV5通过引入运动方向解耦模块和残差驱动的时空细化头，解决了前代版本在遮挡和方向模糊方面的限制，在保持实时推理能力的同时实现了最先进的跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TrackNet系列在快速移动小物体跟踪方面建立了强基线，但存在显著限制：V1-V3因依赖纯视觉线索而难以处理遮挡；TrackNetV4虽然引入了运动输入，但其绝对差分方法丢弃了运动极性，导致方向模糊。需要克服这些瓶颈以实现更鲁棒的跟踪。

Method: 提出TrackNetV5，包含两个新颖机制：1) 运动方向解耦模块，将时间动态分解为带符号的极性场，显式编码运动发生和轨迹方向；2) 残差驱动的时空细化头，基于粗到细范式，利用分解的时空上下文估计校正残差，有效恢复被遮挡目标。

Result: 在TrackNetV2数据集上的实验显示，TrackNetV5实现了新的最先进性能：F1分数0.9859，准确率0.9733，显著优于先前版本。性能提升仅伴随3.7%的FLOPs增加，保持了实时推理能力。

Conclusion: TrackNetV5通过整合运动方向解耦和残差驱动的时空细化，有效解决了前代版本的遮挡和方向模糊问题，在计算效率几乎不变的情况下实现了显著的性能提升，为快速移动小物体跟踪提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出UnicEdit-10M大规模高质量图像编辑数据集和UnicBench综合评测基准，通过轻量级数据管道和Qwen-Verify专家模型解决现有数据规模与质量的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前闭源与开源多模态模型在图像编辑领域的性能差距日益扩大，主要原因是缺乏大规模高质量训练数据和能够诊断模型在多样化编辑行为中弱点的综合评测基准。现有数据构建方法面临规模与质量的权衡：人工标注质量高但不可扩展，自动化流程则存在错误传播和噪声问题。

Method: 提出轻量级数据管道，用端到端模型替代多工具链，并引入统一的后验证阶段。为可扩展的质量控制，训练了一个70亿参数的双任务专家模型Qwen-Verify，用于高效失败检测和指令重写。该管道产生了包含1000万样本的UnicEdit-10M数据集，涵盖多样基础与复杂编辑任务。同时提出UnicBench通用评测基准，扩展了基础编辑评估，明确评估空间和知识驱动的推理能力，并引入细粒度诊断指标如"非编辑一致性"和"推理准确性"。

Result: 构建了UnicEdit-10M数据集和UnicBench评测基准。在UnicBench上对主流模型的分析揭示了它们的局限性，为未来研究提供了明确方向。

Conclusion: 通过创新的数据管道和专家模型解决了图像编辑数据构建中的规模-质量权衡问题，提出的数据集和评测基准有助于缩小闭源与开源模型之间的性能差距，并为模型诊断和改进提供了系统化工具。

Abstract: With the rapid advances of powerful multimodal models such as GPT-4o, Nano Banana, and Seedream 4.0 in Image Editing, the performance gap between closed-source and open-source models is widening, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data and comprehensive benchmarks capable of diagnosing model weaknesses across diverse editing behaviors. Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage. For scalable quality control, we train a 7B dual-task expert model, \textbf{Qwen-Verify}, for efficient failure detection and instruction recaptioning. This pipeline yields \textbf{UnicEdit-10M}, a 10M-scale dataset spanning diverse basic and complex editing tasks. We also propose \textbf{UnicBench}, a general benchmark that extends beyond basic edits to explicitly assess spatial and knowledge-driven reasoning. To enable fine-grained diagnosis, we introduce novel metrics, including \textit{Non-edit Consistency} and \textit{Reasoning Accuracy}. Our analysis of mainstream models on UnicBench reveals their limitations and provides clear directions for future research.

*Zhiwei Chen,Yupeng Hu,Zixu Li,Zhiheng Fu,Haokun Wen,Weili Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HUD框架通过层次化不确定性感知消歧网络，利用视频与文本信息密度差异解决组合视频检索中的指代歧义和语义聚焦问题，在CVR和CIR任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合视频检索(CVR)中，多模态查询（参考视频+修改文本）存在模态间信息密度差异，导致两个关键问题：1) 修改主体指代歧义；2) 有限细节语义聚焦，这限制了CVR模型的性能。

Method: 提出HUD框架，包含三个关键组件：(a) 整体代词消歧：通过整体跨模态交互利用重叠语义；(b) 原子不确定性建模：在原子级别进行跨模态交互；(c) 整体到原子对齐：实现细粒度语义对齐，实现精确的组合特征学习。

Result: HUD在三个基准数据集上为CVR和CIR任务都实现了最先进的性能，代码已开源。

Conclusion: 通过利用视频与文本模态间的信息密度差异，HUD框架有效解决了组合检索中的指代歧义和语义聚焦问题，为多模态查询理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CVR) is a challenging video retrieval task that utilizes multi-modal queries, consisting of a reference video and modification text, to retrieve the desired target video. The core of this task lies in understanding the multi-modal composed query and achieving accurate composed feature learning. Within multi-modal queries, the video modality typically carries richer semantic content compared to the textual modality. However, previous works have largely overlooked the disparity in information density between these two modalities. This limitation can lead to two critical issues: 1) modification subject referring ambiguity and 2) limited detailed semantic focus, both of which degrade the performance of CVR models. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel CVR framework, namely the Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network (HUD). HUD is the first framework that leverages the disparity in information density between video and text to enhance multi-modal query understanding. It comprises three key components: (a) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, (b) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and (c) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment. By exploiting overlapping semantics through holistic cross-modal interaction and fine-grained semantic alignment via atomistic-level cross-modal interaction, HUD enables effective object disambiguation and enhances the focus on detailed semantics, thereby achieving precise composed feature learning. Moreover, our proposed HUD is also applicable to the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) task and achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both CVR and CIR tasks. The codes are available on https://zivchen-ty.github.io/HUD.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频世界模型在合成多样动态视觉环境方面受到关注，但现有方法缺乏对共享世界建模的系统探索，即从同一底层世界在不同相机姿态下生成多个视频。

Method: 提出IC-World框架：1) 利用大型视频模型的内在上下文生成能力并行处理所有输入图像；2) 通过强化学习（Group Relative Policy Optimization）微调，配合两个新奖励模型确保场景级几何一致性和对象级运动一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，IC-World在几何一致性和运动一致性方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统探索基于视频模型的共享世界建模问题的工作，IC-World框架在保持多视频一致性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Video-based world models have recently garnered increasing attention for their ability to synthesize diverse and dynamic visual environments. In this paper, we focus on shared world modeling, where a model generates multiple videos from a set of input images, each representing the same underlying world in different camera poses. We propose IC-World, a novel generation framework, enabling parallel generation for all input images via activating the inherent in-context generation capability of large video models. We further finetune IC-World via reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimization, together with two proposed novel reward models to enforce scene-level geometry consistency and object-level motion consistency among the set of generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IC-World substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometry and motion consistency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore the shared world modeling problem with video-based world models.

TL;DR: 提出PhyCustom框架，通过两种正则化损失激活扩散模型进行物理概念定制，解决现有方法在物理属性生成上的不足


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的文本到图像定制方法在具体概念（如风格、形状）上表现良好，但在物理概念定制方面存在局限，主要原因是训练过程中缺乏明确的物理知识引入，导致无法准确反映文本提示中的物理属性

Method: 提出PhyCustom微调框架，包含两种新颖的正则化损失：等距损失（激活扩散模型学习物理概念）和解耦损失（消除独立概念的混合学习）

Result: 在多样化数据集上的实验表明，PhyCustom在物理概念定制方面在定量和定性上都优于先前的最先进方法和流行方法

Conclusion: PhyCustom框架通过引入物理知识激活扩散模型，有效解决了物理概念定制问题，在物理属性生成方面取得了显著改进

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based text-to-image customization methods have achieved significant success in understanding concrete concepts to control generation processes, such as styles and shapes. However, few efforts dive into the realistic yet challenging customization of physical concepts. The core limitation of current methods arises from the absence of explicitly introducing physical knowledge during training. Even when physics-related words appear in the input text prompts, our experiments consistently demonstrate that these methods fail to accurately reflect the corresponding physical properties in the generated results. In this paper, we propose PhyCustom, a fine-tuning framework comprising two novel regularization losses to activate diffusion model to perform physical customization. Specifically, the proposed isometric loss aims at activating diffusion models to learn physical concepts while decouple loss helps to eliminate the mixture learning of independent concepts. Experiments are conducted on a diverse dataset and our benchmark results demonstrate that PhyCustom outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in terms of physical customization quantitatively and qualitatively.

TL;DR: 对抗训练虽然提高模型鲁棒性，但意外地增加了对抗样本的可迁移性，这带来了新的生态系统风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在计算机视觉中取得巨大成功，但对对抗攻击仍然脆弱。对抗训练是提高模型鲁棒性的主要防御方法，但其对攻击可迁移性的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 训练了包含CNN和ViT的36个多样化模型动物园，进行了全面的可迁移性实验，研究对抗训练模型产生的扰动是否比标准模型更容易迁移。

Result: 发现了一个明显的悖论：对抗训练模型产生的扰动比标准模型产生的扰动更容易迁移，这引入了新的生态系统风险。

Conclusion: 鲁棒性评估不仅应该评估模型对迁移攻击的抵抗能力，还应该评估其产生可迁移对抗样本的倾向性。作者发布了所有模型、代码和实验脚本以供复现和进一步研究。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision, but remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples.

TL;DR: AAG方法仅使用单帧图像结合深度信息和先验动作信息进行动作预测，性能可与需要时间聚合的视频方法竞争


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类观察单帧场景结合上下文就能预测后续动作，研究是否能用单帧替代视频时间聚合进行动作预测

Method: AAG方法结合单帧RGB特征和深度信息增强空间推理，通过视觉语言模型的文本摘要或单帧动作识别器的预测提供长期上下文

Result: 在IKEA-ASM、Meccano和Assembly101三个教学活动数据集上，AAG的性能与时间聚合的视频基线和最先进方法相当

Conclusion: 多模态单帧动作预测可以替代传统的时间聚合方法，特别是在有足够上下文信息的情况下

Abstract: Anticipating actions before they occur is a core challenge in action understanding research. While conventional methods rely on extracting and aggregating temporal information from videos, as humans we can often predict upcoming actions by observing a single moment from a scene, when given sufficient context. Can a model achieve this competence? The short answer is yes, although its effectiveness depends on the complexity of the task. In this work, we investigate to what extent video aggregation can be replaced with alternative modalities. To this end, based on recent advances in visual feature extraction and language-based reasoning, we introduce AAG, a method for Action Anticipation at a Glimpse. AAG combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame for enhanced spatial reasoning, and incorporates prior action information to provide long-term context. This context is obtained either through textual summaries from Vision-Language Models, or from predictions generated by a single-frame action recognizer. Our results demonstrate that multimodal single-frame action anticipation using AAG can perform competitively compared to both temporally aggregated video baselines and state-of-the-art methods across three instructional activity datasets: IKEA-ASM, Meccano, and Assembly101.

TL;DR: 首次系统研究印度和南亚面孔的身份保持AIGC检测，发现现有检测器在该领域存在泛化能力不足，特别是对训练生成器线索过拟合的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代图像编辑器能生成身份保持的AIGC内容，但现有检测器在该领域的鲁棒性和公平性尚不明确，特别是对印度和南亚等代表性不足的人群。

Method: 从FairFD和HAV-DF构建印度聚焦的训练集，使用商业生成器（Gemini和ChatGPT）创建两个身份保持的AIGC测试集，评估AIDE和Effort两种SOTA检测器在预训练和微调模式下的性能。

Result: 微调在域内表现显著提升，但在印度人群的身份保持AIGC测试集上性能严重下降，表明检测器过拟合于训练生成器的特定线索。非身份保持图像上预训练模型性能保持良好。

Conclusion: 身份保持AIGC-印度是一个具有挑战性的实际场景，需要开发保持表征能力的适应方法和印度感知的基准数据集来弥补AIGC检测的泛化差距。

Abstract: Modern image editors can produce identity-preserving AIGC (IP-AIGC), where the same person appears with new attire, background, or lighting. The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift. Our study establishes IP-AIGC-Indian as a challenging and practically relevant scenario and motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to close generalization gaps in AIGC detection.

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scanning (IOS) are essential for digital dentistry, but annotated data scarcity limits automated solutions for pulp canal segmentation and cross-modal registration. To benchmark semi-supervised learning (SSL) in this domain, we organized the STSR 2025 Challenge at MICCAI 2025, featuring two tasks: (1) semi-supervised segmentation of teeth and pulp canals in CBCT, and (2) semi-supervised rigid registration of CBCT and IOS. We provided 60 labeled and 640 unlabeled IOS samples, plus 30 labeled and 250 unlabeled CBCT scans with varying resolutions and fields of view. The challenge attracted strong community participation, with top teams submitting open-source deep learning-based SSL solutions. For segmentation, leading methods used nnU-Net and Mamba-like State Space Models with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, achieving a Dice score of 0.967 and Instance Affinity of 0.738 on the hidden test set. For registration, effective approaches combined PointNetLK with differentiable SVD and geometric augmentation to handle modality gaps; hybrid neural-classical refinement enabled accurate alignment despite limited labels.

Conclusion: 提出的在线RL后训练框架通过密集段级几何奖励有效解决了奖励稀疏性问题，显著提升了相机控制视频生成的性能

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have remarkably improved camera-controlled video generation, but most methods rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leaving online reinforcement learning (RL) post-training largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics. Extensive experiments show that our online RL post-training clearly outperforms SFT baselines across multiple aspects, including camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality, demonstrating its superiority in advancing camera-controlled video generation.

Abstract: We present MindGPT-4ov, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that introduces a general post-training paradigm spanning data production, model training, and efficient deployment. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks at low cost, effectively enhancing the foundational capabilities of MLLMs and the generalization ability. Focusing on data construction, supervised fine-tuning strategies, and multimodal reinforcement learning methods, this work proposes three key innovations: (1) An information density-based data generation scheme, integrated with a dual-dimensional tree-structured label system, enabling automated generation of high-quality cross-domain data. (2) A collaborative curriculum supervised fine-tuning approach that balances the injection of domain-specific knowledge with the preservation of general capabilities. (3) A hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that enhances reasoning ability while simultaneously addressing multi-objective optimization such as diversity exploration, maintenance of multimodal perception, and response conciseness. Moreover, we implement a series of infrastructure optimizations, such as 5D parallel training, operator optimization, and inference quantization to enhance training and inference efficiency while reducing the cost of domain adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that the MindGPT-4ov model outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks such as MMBench, MMStar, MathVision, and MathVista. In addition, MindGPT-4ov also demonstrates superior user experience in vertical domain tasks, enabling a seamless transition from academic research to industrial deployment. MindGPT-4ov provides a general post-training paradigm applicable to a wide range of MLLMs. The model weights, datasets, and code for the Qwen3-VL-based variants will be recently open-sourced to support the community's development of MLLMs.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into how alternative LiDAR-to-image projections affect metric place recognition when coupled with a state-of-the-art vision foundation model. We introduce a modular retrieval pipeline that controls for backbone, aggregation, and evaluation protocol, thereby isolating the influence of the 2-D projection itself. Using consistent geometric and structural channels across multiple datasets and deployment scenarios, we identify the projection characteristics that most strongly determine discriminative power, robustness to environmental variation, and suitability for real-time autonomy. Experiments with different datasets, including integration into an operational place recognition policy, validate the practical relevance of these findings and demonstrate that carefully designed projections can serve as an effective surrogate for end-to-end 3-D learning in LiDAR place recognition.

Motivation: 扩散模型虽然图像生成效果出色，但部署受到高计算成本和大量推理步骤的限制。现有少步蒸馏方法需要重训练且泛化能力下降，需要更智能的加速策略

Method: 采用阶段感知策略：早期语义阶段应用较小加速，后期冗余阶段应用较大加速。使用两个LoRA专家（Slow-LoRA和Fast-LoRA）分别处理不同阶段，仅需轻量级适配器而非重训练

Conclusion: 通过阶段感知的LoRA适配器策略，实现了高效加速和强泛化能力，避免了传统蒸馏方法的重训练成本和性能下降问题

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, yet their deployment remains constrained by the heavy computational cost and the need for numerous inference steps. Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.

Abstract: Understanding high-resolution images remains a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 比特自回归（AR）生成模型在视觉质量方面表现出色，但样本多样性不足。本文旨在探索比特视觉分词器中样本多样性的挑战，分析限制多样性的因素，并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出DiverseAR方法：1）自适应logits分布缩放机制，动态调整二进制输出分布的锐度，使预测更平滑；2）基于能量的生成路径搜索算法，避免采样低置信度token，保持视觉质量。

Result: 大量实验证明，DiverseAR在比特自回归图像生成中显著提高了样本多样性，同时保持了视觉质量。

Conclusion: DiverseAR通过解决比特建模中的二元分类限制和过度锐化的logits分布问题，为比特自回归模型提供了一种有效提升样本多样性的方法，在多样性和视觉质量之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the underexplored challenge of sample diversity in autoregressive (AR) generative models with bitwise visual tokenizers. We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiverseAR substantially improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation.

Conclusion: EGGS通过整合2D和3D高斯表示，成功平衡了外观保真度和几何精度，解决了现有方法的局限性，在计算机视觉和图形学应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) is crucial in computer vision and graphics, with wide applications in AR, VR, and autonomous driving. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with high appearance fidelity, it suffers from multi-view inconsistencies, limiting geometric accuracy. In contrast, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) enforces multi-view consistency but compromises texture details. To address these limitations, we propose Exchangeable Gaussian Splatting (EGGS), a hybrid representation that integrates 2D and 3D Gaussians to balance appearance and geometry. To achieve this, we introduce Hybrid Gaussian Rasterization for unified rendering, Adaptive Type Exchange for dynamic adaptation between 2D and 3D Gaussians, and Frequency-Decoupled Optimization that effectively exploits the strengths of each type of Gaussian representation. Our CUDA-accelerated implementation ensures efficient training and inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGGS outperforms existing methods in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and efficiency, providing a practical solution for high-quality NVS.

Abstract: Text-guided video editing, particularly for object removal and addition, remains a challenging task due to the need for precise spatial and temporal consistency. Existing methods often rely on auxiliary masks or reference images for editing guidance, which limits their scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose LoVoRA, a novel framework for mask-free video object removal and addition using object-aware localization mechanism. Our approach utilizes a unique dataset construction pipeline that integrates image-to-video translation, optical flow-based mask propagation, and video inpainting, enabling temporally consistent edits. The core innovation of LoVoRA is its learnable object-aware localization mechanism, which provides dense spatio-temporal supervision for both object insertion and removal tasks. By leveraging a Diffusion Mask Predictor, LoVoRA achieves end-to-end video editing without requiring external control signals during inference. Extensive experiments and human evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness and high-quality performance of LoVoRA.

Abstract: The next frontier for video generation lies in developing models capable of zero-shot reasoning, where understanding real-world scientific laws is crucial for accurate physical outcome modeling under diverse conditions. However, existing video benchmarks are physical commonsense-based, offering limited insight into video models' scientific reasoning capability. We introduce VideoScience-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate undergraduate-level scientific understanding in video models. Each prompt encodes a composite scientific scenario that requires understanding and reasoning across multiple scientific concepts to generate the correct phenomenon. The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry. We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models in T2V and I2V settings along five dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments. To the best of our knowledge, VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models not only as generators but also as reasoners, requiring their generations to demonstrate scientific understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena.

Abstract: We present Layout Anything, a transformer-based framework for indoor layout estimation that adapts the OneFormer's universal segmentation architecture to geometric structure prediction. Our approach integrates OneFormer's task-conditioned queries and contrastive learning with two key modules: (1) a layout degeneration strategy that augments training data while preserving Manhattan-world constraints through topology-aware transformations, and (2) differentiable geometric losses that directly enforce planar consistency and sharp boundary predictions during training. By unifying these components in an end-to-end framework, the model eliminates complex post-processing pipelines while achieving high-speed inference at 114ms. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, with pixel error (PE) of 5.43% and corner error (CE) of 4.02% on the LSUN, PE of 7.04% (CE 5.17%) on the Hedau and PE of 4.03% (CE 3.15%) on the Matterport3D-Layout datasets.

Abstract: In low-light environments like nighttime driving, image degradation severely challenges in-vehicle camera safety. Since existing enhancement algorithms are often too computationally intensive for vehicular applications, we propose UltraFast-LieNET, a lightweight multi-scale shifted convolutional network for real-time low-light image enhancement. We introduce a Dynamic Shifted Convolution (DSConv) kernel with only 12 learnable parameters for efficient feature extraction. By integrating DSConv with varying shift distances, a Multi-scale Shifted Residual Block (MSRB) is constructed to significantly expand the receptive field. To mitigate lightweight network instability, a residual structure and a novel multi-level gradient-aware loss function are incorporated. UltraFast-LieNET allows flexible parameter configuration, with a minimum size of only 36 parameters. Results on the LOLI-Street dataset show a PSNR of 26.51 dB, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 4.6 dB while utilizing only 180 parameters.

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera information in the bird's eye view (BEV) representation has demonstrated its effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion. The source code is available at https://github.com/gwenzhang/BEVDilation.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge in large language models (LLMs), hindering the development of reliable multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination. Extensive experiments show that InEx consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving 4%-27% gains on general and hallucination benchmarks, and demonstrating strong robustness.

Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a "hard-to-easy" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D object detection, point clouds remain challenging due to sparse data, incomplete structures, and limited semantic information. Capturing contextual relationships between distant objects presents additional difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose GraphFusion3D, a unified framework combining multi-modal fusion with advanced feature learning. Our approach introduces the Adaptive Cross-Modal Transformer (ACMT), which adaptively integrates image features into point representations to enrich both geometric and semantic information. For proposal refinement, we introduce the Graph Reasoning Module (GRM), a novel mechanism that models neighborhood relationships to simultaneously capture local geometric structures and global semantic context. The module employs multi-scale graph attention to dynamically weight both spatial proximity and feature similarity between proposals. We further employ a cascade decoder that progressively refines detections through multi-stage predictions. Extensive experiments on SUN RGB-D (70.6\% AP$_{25}$ and 51.2\% AP$_{50}$) and ScanNetV2 (75.1\% AP$_{25}$ and 60.8\% AP$_{50}$) demonstrate a substantial performance improvement over existing approaches.

Abstract: Prevailing 3D texture generation methods, which often rely on multi-view fusion, are frequently hindered by inter-view inconsistencies and incomplete coverage of complex surfaces, limiting the fidelity and completeness of the generated content. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TEXTRIX, a native 3D attribute generation framework for high-fidelity texture synthesis and downstream applications such as precise 3D part segmentation. Our approach constructs a latent 3D attribute grid and leverages a Diffusion Transformer equipped with sparse attention, enabling direct coloring of 3D models in volumetric space and fundamentally avoiding the limitations of multi-view fusion. Built upon this native representation, the framework naturally extends to high-precision 3D segmentation by training the same architecture to predict semantic attributes on the grid. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures and accurate 3D part segmentation with precise boundaries.

Conclusion: DynamicVerse提供了一个物理尺度、多模态的4D世界建模框架，能够更好地理解和建模动态物理世界，为具身智能体在真实环境中的感知和行动提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic physical world, characterized by its evolving 3D structure, real-world motion, and semantic content with textual descriptions, is crucial for human-agent interaction and enables embodied agents to perceive and act within real environments with human-like capabilities. However, existing datasets are often derived from limited simulators or utilize traditional Structurefrom-Motion for up-to-scale annotation and offer limited descriptive captioning, which restricts the capacity of foundation models to accurately interpret real-world dynamics from monocular videos, commonly sourced from the internet. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DynamicVerse, a physical-scale, multimodal 4D world modeling framework for dynamic real-world video. We employ large vision, geometric, and multimodal models to interpret metric-scale static geometry, real-world dynamic motion, instance-level masks, and holistic descriptive captions. By integrating window-based Bundle Adjustment with global optimization, our method converts long real-world video sequences into a comprehensive 4D multimodal format. DynamicVerse delivers a large-scale dataset consists of 100K+ videos with 800K+ annotated masks and 10M+ frames from internet videos. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark tasks, namely video depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and camera intrinsics estimation, demonstrate that our 4D modeling achieves superior performance in capturing physical-scale measurements with greater global accuracy than existing methods.

Conclusion: DGGT提供了一个单次前向传播的无姿态算法，实现了最先进的动态场景重建，解决了现有方法在灵活性、可扩展性和实用性方面的限制，为自动驾驶训练和评估提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving needs fast, scalable 4D reconstruction and re-simulation for training and evaluation, yet most methods for dynamic driving scenes still rely on per-scene optimization, known camera calibration, or short frame windows, making them slow and impractical. We revisit this problem from a feedforward perspective and introduce \textbf{Driving Gaussian Grounded Transformer (DGGT)}, a unified framework for pose-free dynamic scene reconstruction. We note that the existing formulations, treating camera pose as a required input, limit flexibility and scalability. Instead, we reformulate pose as an output of the model, enabling reconstruction directly from sparse, unposed images and supporting an arbitrary number of views for long sequences. Our approach jointly predicts per-frame 3D Gaussian maps and camera parameters, disentangles dynamics with a lightweight dynamic head, and preserves temporal consistency with a lifespan head that modulates visibility over time. A diffusion-based rendering refinement further reduces motion/interpolation artifacts and improves novel-view quality under sparse inputs. The result is a single-pass, pose-free algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance and speed. Trained and evaluated on large-scale driving benchmarks (Waymo, nuScenes, Argoverse2), our method outperforms prior work both when trained on each dataset and in zero-shot transfer across datasets, and it scales well as the number of input frames increases.

Motivation: LiDAR在平坦区域精度高，但容易遗漏细小几何结构和暗色吸光材料；而多视角摄影测量能捕捉这些细节但精度不足。需要结合两者优势实现更完整的3D重建

Method: 1. 分析LiDAR光束发散导致的结构边缘伪影；2. 引入模糊性启发式方法，通过点云密度变化识别缺失区域；3. 约束高斯面元重建在模糊区域进行优化和密集化；4. 提取高斯基元并采样点补全点云；5. 针对大规模重建采用分治策略

Conclusion: SurfFill成功结合了LiDAR和相机优势，通过高斯面元补全方案有效解决了LiDAR在细小结构和边缘区域的缺失问题，实现了更完整的3D重建

Abstract: LiDAR-captured point clouds are often considered the gold standard in active 3D reconstruction. While their accuracy is exceptional in flat regions, the capturing is susceptible to miss small geometric structures and may fail with dark, absorbent materials. Alternatively, capturing multiple photos of the scene and applying 3D photogrammetry can infer these details as they often represent feature-rich regions. However, the accuracy of LiDAR for featureless regions is rarely reached. Therefore, we suggest combining the strengths of LiDAR and camera-based capture by introducing SurfFill: a Gaussian surfel-based LiDAR completion scheme. We analyze LiDAR capturings and attribute LiDAR beam divergence as a main factor for artifacts, manifesting mostly at thin structures and edges. We use this insight to introduce an ambiguity heuristic for completed scans by evaluating the change in density in the point cloud. This allows us to identify points close to missed areas, which we can then use to grow additional points from to complete the scan. For this point growing, we constrain Gaussian surfel reconstruction [Huang et al. 2024] to focus optimization and densification on these ambiguous areas. Finally, Gaussian primitives of the reconstruction in ambiguous areas are extracted and sampled for points to complete the point cloud. To address the challenges of large-scale reconstruction, we extend this pipeline with a divide-and-conquer scheme for building-sized point cloud completion. We evaluate on the task of LiDAR point cloud completion of synthetic and real-world scenes and find that our method outperforms previous reconstruction methods.

Motivation: 肖像视频编辑需要灵活而精确的控制各种修改（如外观变化、表情编辑、添加对象），同时保持主体原始时间行为，确保每个编辑帧与源帧精确同步。现有方法难以平衡编辑保真度和精确运动保持。

Method: 使用图像到视频扩散模型，通过修改第一帧定义编辑并传播到整个序列。训练上下文LoRA使用成对视频（相同运动轨迹但不同外观），通过同步过滤自动生成和筛选最时间对齐的样本。模型学习结合源视频运动线索和编辑第一帧的视觉变化。

Result: 在紧凑、高度筛选的同步人类肖像数据集上训练，Sync-LoRA能够泛化到未见身份和多样化编辑（修改外观、添加对象、改变背景），鲁棒处理姿势和表情变化。结果展示高视觉保真度和强时间连贯性。

Conclusion: Sync-LoRA在编辑保真度和精确运动保持之间实现了稳健平衡，为肖像视频编辑提供了高质量视觉修改同时保持帧级同步和身份一致性的有效方法。

Abstract: Editing portrait videos is a challenging task that requires flexible yet precise control over a wide range of modifications, such as appearance changes, expression edits, or the addition of objects. The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while maintaining frame-accurate synchronization and identity consistency. Our approach uses an image-to-video diffusion model, where the edit is defined by modifying the first frame and then propagated to the entire sequence. To enable accurate synchronization, we train an in-context LoRA using paired videos that depict identical motion trajectories but differ in appearance. These pairs are automatically generated and curated through a synchronization-based filtering process that selects only the most temporally aligned examples for training. This training setup teaches the model to combine motion cues from the source video with the visual changes introduced in the edited first frame. Trained on a compact, highly curated set of synchronized human portraits, Sync-LoRA generalizes to unseen identities and diverse edits (e.g., modifying appearance, adding objects, or changing backgrounds), robustly handling variations in pose and expression. Our results demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, achieving a robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation.

Abstract: When applied sequentially to video, frame-based networks often exhibit temporal inconsistency - for example, outputs that flicker between frames. This problem is amplified when the network inputs contain time-varying corruptions. In this work, we introduce a general approach for adapting frame-based models for stable and robust inference on video. We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss. By analyzing the theoretical properties of this loss, we identify the conditions where it produces well-behaved stabilizer training. Our experiments validate our approach on several vision tasks including denoising (NAFNet), image enhancement (HDRNet), monocular depth (Depth Anything v2), and semantic segmentation (DeepLabv3+). Our method improves temporal stability and robustness against a range of image corruptions (including compression artifacts, noise, and adverse weather), while preserving or improving the quality of predictions.

Abstract: The boundary representation (B-Rep) is the standard data structure used in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for defining solid models. Despite recent progress, directly generating B-Reps end-to-end with precise geometry and watertight topology remains a challenge. This paper presents AutoBrep, a novel Transformer model that autoregressively generates B-Reps with high quality and validity. AutoBrep employs a unified tokenization scheme that encodes both geometric and topological characteristics of a B-Rep model as a sequence of discrete tokens. Geometric primitives (i.e., surfaces and curves) are encoded as latent geometry tokens, and their structural relationships are defined as special topological reference tokens. Sequence order in AutoBrep naturally follows a breadth first traversal of the B-Rep face adjacency graph. At inference time, neighboring faces and edges along with their topological structure are progressively generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our unified representation when coupled with next-token prediction for B-Rep generation. AutoBrep outperforms baselines with better quality and watertightness. It is also highly scalable to complex solids with good fidelity and inference speed. We further show that autocompleting B-Reps is natively supported through our unified tokenization, enabling user-controllable CAD generation with minimal changes.

Method: 理论证明展开网络是条件概率流ODE的离散实现，提出FLAT方法：从ODE离散化推导展开网络参数，并将中间重建与理想ODE轨迹对齐。

Result: 在三个MRI数据集上，FLAT实现高质量重建，比基于扩散的生成模型减少3倍迭代次数，比展开网络显著提高稳定性。

Conclusion: 通过建立展开网络与ODE的理论联系，FLAT方法在MRI重建中实现了效率与稳定性的平衡，为加速MRI提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers excellent soft-tissue contrast without ionizing radiation, but its long acquisition time limits clinical utility. Recent methods accelerate MRI by under-sampling $k$-space and reconstructing the resulting images using deep learning. Unrolled networks have been widely used for the reconstruction task due to their efficiency, but suffer from unstable evolving caused by freely-learnable parameters in intermediate steps. In contrast, diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations offer theoretical stability in both medical and natural image tasks but are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce flow ODEs to MRI reconstruction by theoretically proving that unrolled networks are discrete implementations of conditional probability flow ODEs. This connection provides explicit formulations for parameters and clarifies how intermediate states should evolve. Building on this insight, we propose Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT), which derives unrolled parameters from the ODE discretization and aligns intermediate reconstructions with the ideal ODE trajectory to improve stability and convergence. Experiments on three MRI datasets show that FLAT achieves high-quality reconstructions with up to $3\times$ fewer iterations than diffusion-based generative models and significantly greater stability than unrolled networks.

Abstract: We propose MAViD, a novel Multimodal framework for Audio-Visual Dialogue understanding and generation. Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.

Abstract: Despite progress in video-to-audio generation, the field focuses predominantly on mono output, lacking spatial immersion. Existing binaural approaches remain constrained by a two-stage pipeline that first generates mono audio and then performs spatialization, often resulting in error accumulation and spatio-temporal inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of end-to-end binaural spatial audio generation directly from silent video. To support this task, we present the BiAudio dataset, comprising approximately 97K video-binaural audio pairs spanning diverse real-world scenes and camera rotation trajectories, constructed through a semi-automated pipeline. Furthermore, we propose ViSAudio, an end-to-end framework that employs conditional flow matching with a dual-branch audio generation architecture, where two dedicated branches model the audio latent flows. Integrated with a conditional spacetime module, it balances consistency between channels while preserving distinctive spatial characteristics, ensuring precise spatio-temporal alignment between audio and the input video. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ViSAudio outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, generating high-quality binaural audio with spatial immersion that adapts effectively to viewpoint changes, sound-source motion, and diverse acoustic environments.

Abstract: We investigate whether video generative models can exhibit visuospatial intelligence, a capability central to human cognition, using only visual data. To this end, we present Video4Spatial, a framework showing that video diffusion models conditioned solely on video-based scene context can perform complex spatial tasks. We validate on two tasks: scene navigation - following camera-pose instructions while remaining consistent with 3D geometry of the scene, and object grounding - which requires semantic localization, instruction following, and planning. Both tasks use video-only inputs, without auxiliary modalities such as depth or poses. With simple yet effective design choices in the framework and data curation, Video4Spatial demonstrates strong spatial understanding from video context: it plans navigation and grounds target objects end-to-end, follows camera-pose instructions while maintaining spatial consistency, and generalizes to long contexts and out-of-domain environments. Taken together, these results advance video generative models toward general visuospatial reasoning.

Abstract: Current video generation techniques excel at single-shot clips but struggle to produce narrative multi-shot videos, which require flexible shot arrangement, coherent narrative, and controllability beyond text prompts. To tackle these challenges, we propose MultiShotMaster, a framework for highly controllable multi-shot video generation. We extend a pretrained single-shot model by integrating two novel variants of RoPE. First, we introduce Multi-Shot Narrative RoPE, which applies explicit phase shift at shot transitions, enabling flexible shot arrangement while preserving the temporal narrative order. Second, we design Spatiotemporal Position-Aware RoPE to incorporate reference tokens and grounding signals, enabling spatiotemporal-grounded reference injection. In addition, to overcome data scarcity, we establish an automated data annotation pipeline to extract multi-shot videos, captions, cross-shot grounding signals and reference images. Our framework leverages the intrinsic architectural properties to support multi-shot video generation, featuring text-driven inter-shot consistency, customized subject with motion control, and background-driven customized scene. Both shot count and duration are flexibly configurable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and outstanding controllability of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPTArena是一个PowerPoint编辑基准测试，专注于自然语言指令下的真实幻灯片编辑，包含100个演示文稿、2125张幻灯片和800多个目标编辑。PPTPilot是基于此的结构感知幻灯片编辑代理，通过规划-编辑-检查循环实现精确控制，在实验中表现优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PowerPoint编辑基准主要关注图像PDF渲染或文本到幻灯片生成，缺乏对真实幻灯片进行自然语言指令下的可靠修改评估。需要建立一个更全面的基准来评估幻灯片编辑能力，特别是跨文本、图表、表格、动画和样式等多种元素的编辑任务。

Method: PPTArena基准包含100个演示文稿、2125张幻灯片和800多个目标编辑，涵盖多种编辑类型。采用双VLM作为评判管道，分别评估指令遵循和视觉质量。PPTPilot是一个结构感知的幻灯片编辑代理，通过语义编辑序列规划、高级程序化工具与确定性XML操作的路由，以及基于任务特定约束的迭代计划-编辑-检查循环来验证输出。

Result: PPTPilot在复合编辑、布局敏感编辑和跨幻灯片编辑方面优于强大的专有代理和前沿VLM系统超过10个百分点，在视觉保真度和整个演示文稿一致性方面取得显著提升。然而，现有代理在PPT Arena中的长视野、文档规模任务上仍然表现不佳。

Conclusion: PPTArena为PowerPoint编辑提供了一个全面的基准测试，PPTPilot展示了结构感知编辑方法的有效性，但可靠PPT编辑仍面临长视野、文档规模任务的挑战，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: We introduce PPTArena, a benchmark for PowerPoint editing that measures reliable modifications to real slides under natural-language instructions. In contrast to image-PDF renderings or text-to-slide generation, PPTArena focuses on in-place editing across 100 decks, 2125 slides, and over 800 targeted edits covering text, charts, tables, animations, and master-level styles. Each case includes a ground-truth deck, a fully specified target outcome, and a dual VLM-as-judge pipeline that separately scores instruction following and visual quality using both structural diffs and slide images. Building on this setting, we propose PPTPilot, a structure-aware slide-editing agent that plans semantic edit sequences, routes between high-level programmatic tools and deterministic XML operations for precise control, and verifies outputs through an iterative plan-edit-check loop against task-specific constraints. In our experiments, PPTPilot outperforms strong proprietary agents and frontier VLM systems by over 10 percentage points on compound, layout-sensitive, and cross-slide edits, with particularly large gains in visual fidelity and deck-wide consistency. Despite these improvements, existing agents still underperform on long-horizon, document-scale tasks in PPTArena, highlighting the remaining challenges in reliable PPT editing.

TL;DR: OneThinker是一个统一的多模态推理模型，能够处理图像和视频的多种视觉任务，通过多任务强化学习实现知识共享和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常为不同任务训练独立模型，将图像和视频推理视为分离领域，这限制了向多模态推理通用模型的扩展性，阻碍了跨任务和模态的知识共享。

Method: 构建OneThinker-600k训练语料库覆盖多种视觉任务，使用商业模型进行CoT标注得到OneThinker-SFT-340k用于SFT冷启动，提出EMA-GRPO方法通过跟踪任务奖励标准差移动平均来处理多任务RL中的奖励异质性。

Conclusion: OneThinker向统一的多模态推理通用模型迈进了一步，所有代码、模型和数据均已发布。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently achieved remarkable success in eliciting visual reasoning within Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches typically train separate models for different tasks and treat image and video reasoning as disjoint domains. This results in limited scalability toward a multimodal reasoning generalist, which restricts practical versatility and hinders potential knowledge sharing across tasks and modalities. To this end, we propose OneThinker, an all-in-one reasoning model that unifies image and video understanding across diverse fundamental visual tasks, including question answering, captioning, spatial and temporal grounding, tracking, and segmentation. To achieve this, we construct the OneThinker-600k training corpus covering all these tasks and employ commercial models for CoT annotation, resulting in OneThinker-SFT-340k for SFT cold start. Furthermore, we propose EMA-GRPO to handle reward heterogeneity in multi-task RL by tracking task-wise moving averages of reward standard deviations for balanced optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse visual benchmarks show that OneThinker delivers strong performance on 31 benchmarks, across 10 fundamental visual understanding tasks. Moreover, it exhibits effective knowledge transfer between certain tasks and preliminary zero-shot generalization ability, marking a step toward a unified multimodal reasoning generalist. All code, model, and data are released.

TL;DR: CAMEO：通过几何对应监督注意力图，提升多视角扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视角扩散模型虽然能实现视角一致生成，但其工作机制不明确。研究发现这些模型的注意力图确实能学习几何对应关系，但这种对应信号不完整，在大视角变化下准确性会下降。

Method: 提出CAMEO训练技术，直接使用几何对应关系监督注意力图。关键发现是只需监督单个注意力层就足以引导模型学习精确对应关系，从而保持参考图像的几何结构。

Result: CAMEO将收敛所需的训练迭代次数减少一半，同时在相同迭代次数下实现更优性能。该方法具有模型无关性，可应用于任何多视角扩散模型。

Conclusion: 通过几何对应监督注意力图是提升多视角扩散模型训练效率和生成质量的有效方法，CAMEO技术简单但效果显著。

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for novel view synthesis, yet the underlying mechanism that enables their view-consistency remains unclear. In this work, we first verify that the attention maps of these models acquire geometric correspondence throughout training, attending to the geometrically corresponding regions across reference and target views for view-consistent generation. However, this correspondence signal remains incomplete, with its accuracy degrading under large viewpoint changes. Building on these findings, we introduce CAMEO, a simple yet effective training technique that directly supervises attention maps using geometric correspondence to enhance both the training efficiency and generation quality of multi-view diffusion models. Notably, supervising a single attention layer is sufficient to guide the model toward learning precise correspondences, thereby preserving the geometry and structure of reference images, accelerating convergence, and improving novel view synthesis performance. CAMEO reduces the number of training iterations required for convergence by half while achieving superior performance at the same iteration counts. We further demonstrate that CAMEO is model-agnostic and can be applied to any multi-view diffusion model.

TL;DR: MagicQuill V2提出分层组合范式，通过将创意意图分解为内容、空间、结构和颜色层，弥合扩散模型语义能力与传统图形软件精细控制之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散变换器虽然擅长整体生成，但使用单一提示无法区分用户对内容、位置和外观的不同意图，导致生成控制不够精细。

Method: 将创意意图分解为可控视觉线索堆栈：内容层（创建什么）、空间层（放置位置）、结构层（形状如何）、颜色层（调色板）。采用专门的数据生成管道实现上下文感知内容集成，统一控制模块处理所有视觉线索，微调空间分支实现精确局部编辑。

Result: 实验验证该分层方法能有效解决用户意图差距，为创作者提供直接、直观的生成过程控制。

Conclusion: 分层组合范式成功弥合了扩散模型语义能力与传统图形软件精细控制之间的鸿沟，实现了更可控的图像编辑。

Abstract: We propose MagicQuill V2, a novel system that introduces a \textbf{layered composition} paradigm to generative image editing, bridging the gap between the semantic power of diffusion models and the granular control of traditional graphics software. While diffusion transformers excel at holistic generation, their use of singular, monolithic prompts fails to disentangle distinct user intentions for content, position, and appearance. To overcome this, our method deconstructs creative intent into a stack of controllable visual cues: a content layer for what to create, a spatial layer for where to place it, a structural layer for how it is shaped, and a color layer for its palette. Our technical contributions include a specialized data generation pipeline for context-aware content integration, a unified control module to process all visual cues, and a fine-tuned spatial branch for precise local editing, including object removal. Extensive experiments validate that this layered approach effectively resolves the user intention gap, granting creators direct, intuitive control over the generative process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI应用（如大语言模型）中向量数量的快速增长，图索引大小迅速超过单个GPU的内存容量。现有的CPU-GPU架构在从CPU内存或SSD加载向量时会导致GPU计算停滞，影响搜索效率。

Method: 提出Fantasy系统，在GPU集群中使用GPUDirect Async技术，将向量搜索和数据传输进行流水线化处理，重叠计算和网络通信，支持大规模图索引和大批量查询。

Result: Fantasy系统显著提高了大规模图索引的搜索吞吐量，能够处理超出单GPU内存容量的大型图，并支持大批量查询。

Conclusion: 通过GPU集群中的流水线化设计和GPUDirect Async技术，Fantasy系统有效解决了大规模向量相似度搜索的内存限制问题，实现了高性能的向量搜索系统。

Abstract: Vector similarity search has become a critical component in AI-driven applications such as large language models (LLMs). To achieve high recall and low latency, GPUs are utilized to exploit massive parallelism for faster query processing. However, as the number of vectors continues to grow, the graph size quickly exceeds the memory capacity of a single GPU, making it infeasible to store and process the entire index on a single GPU. Recent work uses CPU-GPU architectures to keep vectors in CPU memory or SSDs, but the loading step stalls GPU computation. We present Fantasy, an efficient system that pipelines vector search and data transfer in a GPU cluster with GPUDirect Async. Fantasy overlaps computation and network communication to significantly improve search throughput for large graphs and deliver large query batch sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内存解聚技术有望扩展HPC系统的内存容量并提高利用率，但访问远程内存的性能开销对计算密集型HPC应用构成重大挑战，因为这类应用的执行时间对数据局部性高度敏感。

Method: DOLMA框架：1）智能识别并将数据对象卸载到远程内存；2）提供定量分析以确定合适的本地内存大小；3）利用HPC应用可预测的内存访问模式，通过双缓冲区设计实现远程内存预取；4）精心平衡本地和远程内存使用，并保持多线程并发性。

Conclusion: DOLMA为HPC领域利用解聚内存提供了一个灵活高效的解决方案，同时最小化了对应用性能的影响。

Abstract: Memory disaggregation is promising to scale memory capacity and improves utilization in HPC systems. However, the performance overhead of accessing remote memory poses a significant challenge, particularly for compute-intensive HPC applications where execution times are highly sensitive to data locality. In this work, we present DOLMA, a Data Object Level M emory dis Aggregation framework designed for HPC applications. DOLMA intelligently identifies and offloads data objects to remote memory, while providing quantitative analysis to decide a suitable local memory size. Furthermore, DOLMA leverages the predictable memory access patterns typical in HPC applications and enables remote memory prefetch via a dual-buffer design. By carefully balancing local and remote memory usage and maintaining multi-thread concurrency, DOLMA provides a flexible and efficient solution for leveraging disaggregated memory in HPC domains while minimally compromising application performance. Evaluating with eight HPC workloads and computational kernels, DOLMA limits performance degradation to less than 16% while reducing local memory usage by up to 63%, on average.

Abstract: The increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads across diverse computing environments has driven the need for more efficient data management strategies. Traditional cloud-based architectures struggle to handle the sheer volume and velocity of AI-driven data, leading to inefficiencies in storage, computation, and data movement. This paper explores the integration of active storage systems within the computing continuum to optimize AI workload distribution.
  By embedding computation directly into storage architectures, active storage is able to reduce data transfer overhead, enhancing performance and improving resource utilization. Other existing frameworks and architectures offer mechanisms to distribute certain AI processes across distributed environments; however, they lack the flexibility and adaptability that the continuum requires, both regarding the heterogeneity of devices and the rapid-changing algorithms and models being used by domain experts and researchers.
  This article proposes a software architecture aimed at seamlessly distributing AI workloads across the computing continuum, and presents its implementation using mainstream Python libraries and dataClay, an active storage platform. The evaluation shows the benefits and trade-offs regarding memory consumption, storage requirements, training times, and execution efficiency across different devices. Experimental results demonstrate that the process of offloading workloads through active storage significantly improves memory efficiency and training speeds while maintaining accuracy. Our findings highlight the potential of active storage to revolutionize AI workload management, making distributed AI deployments more scalable and resource-efficient with a very low entry barrier for domain experts and application developers.

Conclusion: 该自组织生成树算法为分布式系统提供了可扩展的广播通信基础，通过VCube拓扑实现高效容错，支持动态环境下的可靠通信

Abstract: The most common strategy for enabling a process in a distributed system to broadcast a message is one-to-all communication. However, this approach is not scalable, as it places a heavy load on the sender. This work presents an autonomic algorithm that enables the $n$ processes in a distributed system to build and maintain a spanning tree connecting themselves. In this context, processes are the vertices of the spanning tree. By definition, a spanning tree connects all processes without forming cycles. The proposed algorithm ensures that every vertex in the spanning tree has both an in-degree and the tree depth of at most $log_2 n$. When all processes are correct, the degree of each process is exactly $log_2 n$. A spanning tree is dynamically created from any source process and is transparently reconstructed as processes fail or recover. Up to $n-1$ processes can fail, and the correct processes remain connected through a scalable, functioning spanning tree. To build and maintain the tree, processes use the VCube virtual topology, which also serves as a failure detector. Two broadcast algorithms based on the autonomic spanning tree algorithm are presented: one for best-effort broadcast and one for reliable broadcast. Simulation results are provided, including comparisons with other alternatives.

Result: 提出组件化FAIR方法，能更好支持HPC用户多样化和演化的需求，同时最大化其工作的长期价值。

Conclusion: HPC中心应设计支持跨学科研究的基础设施，通过组件化FAIR方法促进计算组件的有效发现、共享和重用。

Abstract: High Performance Computing (HPC) centers provide advanced infrastructure that enables scientific research at extreme scale. These centers operate with hardware configurations, software environments, and security requirements that differ substantially from most users' local systems. As a result, users often develop customized digital artifacts that are tightly coupled to a given HPC center. This practice can lead to significant duplication of effort as multiple users independently create similar solutions to common problems. The FAIR Principles offer a framework to address these challenges. Initially designed to improve data stewardship, the FAIR approach has since been extended to encompass software, workflows, models, and infrastructure. By encouraging the use of rich metadata and community standards, FAIR practices aim to make digital artifacts easier to share and reuse, both within and across scientific domains. Many FAIR initiatives have emerged within individual research communities, often aligned by discipline (e.g. bioinformatics, earth sciences). These communities have made progress in adopting FAIR practices, but their domain-specific nature can lead to silos that limit broader collaboration. Thus, we propose that HPC centers play a more active role in fostering FAIR ecosystems that support research across multiple disciplines. This requires designing infrastructure that enables researchers to discover, share, and reuse computational components more effectively. Here, we build on the architecture of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) EOSC-Life FAIR Workflows Collaboratory to propose a model tailored to the needs of HPC. Rather than focusing on entire workflows, we emphasize the importance of making individual workflow components FAIR. This component-based approach better supports the diverse and evolving needs of HPC users while maximizing the long-term value of their work.

Abstract: As GPU architectures rapidly evolve to meet the overcoming demands of exascale computing and machine learning, the performance implications of architectural innovations remain poorly understood across diverse workloads. NVIDIA's Blackwell (B200) generation introduce significant architectural advances including the 5th generation tensor cores, tensor memory (TMEM), decompression engine (DE), and dual chips; however systematic methodologies for quantifying these improvements lag behind hardware development cycles.

Motivation: 事件相机(EBCs)在监控和自动驾驶中应用广泛，但现有的角点检测算法（如TOS）在资源受限的边缘设备上实现时存在显著延迟，削弱了EBCs的高速低功耗优势。

Method: 提出NM-TOS近内存架构，采用读写解耦的8T SRAM单元，通过流水线优化补丁更新速度，结合硬件-软件协同优化的外围电路和动态电压频率缩放(DVFS)技术。

Conclusion: NM-TOS架构有效解决了事件相机角点检测在边缘设备上的延迟问题，通过近内存计算和DVFS技术实现了显著的延迟和能耗优化，同时保持了良好的检测精度。

Abstract: Event-based Cameras (EBCs) are widely utilized in surveillance and autonomous driving applications due to their high speed and low power consumption. Corners are essential low-level features in event-driven computer vision, and novel algorithms utilizing event-based representations, such as Threshold-Ordinal Surface (TOS), have been developed for corner detection. However, the implementation of these algorithms on resource-constrained edge devices is hindered by significant latency, undermining the advantages of EBCs. To address this challenge, a near-memory architecture for efficient TOS updates (NM-TOS) is proposed. This architecture employs a read-write decoupled 8T SRAM cell and optimizes patch update speed through pipelining. Hardware-software co-optimized peripheral circuits and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) enable power and latency reductions. Compared to traditional digital implementations, our architecture reduces latency/energy by 24.7x/1.2x at Vdd = 1.2 V or 1.93x/6.6x at Vdd = 0.6 V based on 65nm CMOS process. Monte Carlo simulations confirm robust circuit operation, demonstrating zero bit error rate at operating voltages above 0.62 V, with only 0.2% at 0.61 V and 2.5% at 0.6 V. Corner detection evaluation using precision-recall area under curve (AUC) metrics reveals minor AUC reductions of 0.027 and 0.015 at 0.6 V for two popular EBC datasets.

Conclusion: 提出的解耦时间-空间维度方法有效解决了CGRA编译的可扩展性问题，为大规模CGRA的高效编译提供了可行方案

Abstract: Coarse-Grain Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) provide flexibility and energy efficiency in accelerating compute-intensive loops. Existing compilation techniques often struggle with scalability, unable to map code onto large CGRAs. To address this, we propose a novel approach to the mapping problem where the time and space dimensions are decoupled and explored separately. We leverage an SMT formulation to traverse the time dimension first, and then perform a monomorphism-based search to find a valid spatial solution. Experimental results show that our approach achieves the same mapping quality of state-of-the-art techniques while significantly reducing compilation time, with this reduction being particularly tangible when compiling for large CGRAs. We achieve approximately $10^5\times$ average compilation speedup for the benchmarks evaluated on a $20\times 20$ CGRA.

*Cristian Tirelli,Lorenzo Ferretti,Laura Pozzi*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: SAT-MapIt：一种基于SAT求解器的CGRA映射方法，通过核移动调度(KMS)将映射问题转化为布尔可满足性问题，相比现有方法在47.72%的基准测试中表现更好


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CGRA映射技术主要基于模调度和图算法（如最大团枚举），这些方法在探索解空间方面不够有效。需要一种更有效的映射方法来提高CGRA对计算密集型循环的加速性能。

Method: 提出SAT-MapIt方法：1）引入核移动调度(KMS)作为中间表示；2）结合数据流图和CGRA架构信息，将映射问题转化为布尔可满足性问题(SAT)；3）使用SAT求解器高效探索解空间；4）采用迭代方法，如果当前迭代间隔(II)无解，则增加II重新求解。

Result: 在47.72%的基准测试中优于现有方法：有时能找到更低的迭代间隔(II)，有时能在现有方法找不到有效映射的情况下找到有效映射。

Conclusion: 基于SAT的映射方法比现有基于图算法的方法更有效，能够更好地探索解空间，为CGRA编译提供更优的映射方案。

Abstract: Coarse-Grain Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) are emerging low-power architectures aimed at accelerating compute-intensive application loops. The acceleration that a CGRA can ultimately provide, however, heavily depends on the quality of the mapping, i.e. on how effectively the loop is compiled onto the given platform. State of the Art compilation techniques achieve mapping through modulo scheduling, a strategy which attempts to minimize the II (Iteration Interval) needed to execute a loop, and they do so usually through well known graph algorithms, such as Max-Clique Enumeration.
  We address the mapping problem through a SAT formulation, instead, and thus explore the solution space more effectively than current SoA tools. To formulate the SAT problem, we introduce an ad-hoc schedule called the \textit{kernel mobility schedule} (KMS), which we use in conjunction with the data-flow graph and the architectural information of the CGRA in order to create a set of boolean statements that describe all constraints to be obeyed by the mapping for a given II. We then let the SAT solver efficiently navigate this complex space. As in other SoA techniques, the process is iterative: if a valid mapping does not exist for the given II, the II is increased and a new KMS and set of constraints is generated and solved.
  Our experimental results show that SAT-MapIt obtains better results compared to SoA alternatives in $47.72\%$ of the benchmarks explored: sometimes finding a lower II, and others even finding a valid mapping when none could previously be found.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CGRA作为协处理器加速计算密集型循环负载，现有编译技术使用模调度最小化迭代间隔，但仍有改进空间。本文旨在通过改进编译过程，为任意拓扑找到最低迭代间隔

Method: 提出基于可满足性（SAT）的映射问题公式化方法，引入Kernel Mobility Schedule来编码给定数据流图和迭代间隔的所有可能映射，结合CGRA架构信息生成约束条件

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法不仅平均减少了编译时间，而且相比现有最先进技术获得了更高质量的映射结果

Conclusion: 基于SAT的CGRA编译方法通过Kernel Mobility Schedule有效解决了映射问题，在编译时间和映射质量方面均优于现有技术

Abstract: Emerging low-powered architectures like Coarse-Grain Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) are becoming more common. Often included as co-processors, they are used to accelerate compute-intensive workloads like loops. The speedup obtained is defined by the hardware design of the accelerator and by the quality of the compilation. State of the art (SoA) compilation techniques leverage modulo scheduling to minimize the Iteration Interval (II), exploit the architecture parallelism and, consequentially, reduce the execution time of the accelerated workload. In our work, we focus on improving the compilation process by finding the lowest II for any given topology, through a satisfiability (SAT) formulation of the mapping problem. We introduce a novel schedule, called Kernel Mobility Schedule, to encode all the possible mappings for a given Data Flow Graph (DFG) and for a given II. The schedule is used together with the CGRA architectural information to generate all the constraints necessary to find a valid mapping. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only reduces compilation time on average but also achieves higher quality mappings compared to existing SoA techniques.

TL;DR: OmniGuard：首个全模态安全护栏系统，通过结构化安全标签和专家模型蒸馏，在文本、图像、视频、音频等多模态场景中实现统一的安全防护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全护栏研究主要针对单模态场景，采用二元分类框架，在多模态AI系统中存在鲁棒性不足的问题。随着全模态大语言模型（OLLMs）的发展，需要能够跨所有模态进行安全防护的统一解决方案。

Method: 提出OmniGuard框架，构建包含21万+样本的全模态安全数据集，涵盖所有模态的单模态和跨模态样本。每个样本都标注结构化安全标签，并通过针对性蒸馏从专家模型获取精心策划的安全评析。

Result: 在15个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，OmniGuard在各种多模态安全场景中表现出强大的有效性和泛化能力。系统能够跨所有模态执行政策执行和风险缓解。

Conclusion: OmniGuard为全模态安全防护提供了统一框架，通过有意识的推理能力实现跨模态安全保护，为构建更鲁棒的全模态安全系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

TL;DR: R-Few是一个通过少量人工监督实现AI稳定自进化的框架，使用挑战者-求解器自我博弈机制，在数学和通用推理任务上取得持续迭代改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI自进化系统在实践中常因概念漂移、多样性崩溃和错误进化等问题而停滞或退化，需要一种在最小化人工监督下实现稳定可控自进化的方法。

Method: 提出R-Few框架：1)挑战者使用少量人工标注样本指导合成问题生成；2)求解器在基于难度的在线课程下联合训练人工和合成样本；3)通过上下文基础化和混合训练融入轻量级人工监督。

Result: 在数学和通用推理基准测试中实现持续迭代改进：Qwen3-8B-Base在数学任务上比R-Zero提升3.0分，性能与使用20倍人工数据的General-Reasoner相当；消融研究证实了挑战者训练和课程求解器训练的互补贡献。

Conclusion: R-Few通过轻量级人工监督和引导式自我博弈，有效缓解了概念漂移问题，实现了更稳定可控的协同进化动态，为AI自进化提供了实用框架。

Abstract: AI self-evolution has long been envisioned as a path toward superintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences. Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM推理能力提升，但迭代推理可能强化信念固化和确认偏误，而非促进真相寻求。需要系统评估LLM推理中的信念固化现象。

Method: 利用贝叶斯统计中的鞅性质，提出无监督、基于回归的鞅分数来衡量违反该性质的程度。在事件预测、价值负载问题和学术论文评审等开放领域进行评估。

Result: 发现违反鞅性质的现象在模型和设置中普遍存在，当前信念正向预测未来信念更新（信念固化）。识别了更容易出现信念固化的模型、推理技术和领域。鞅分数在有真实标签的领域能预测准确性。

Conclusion: 鞅分数作为无监督指标能有效评估LLM推理中的信念固化，是真相寻求能力的有效代理指标，揭示了LLM推理中存在的系统性偏差。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information. However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly across perception, language, reasoning, and multimodal domains. Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fundamentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self-monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non-adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust generalization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.

Result: 评估15个当前VLM显示，模型在多视角空间推理中的跨视角对齐和视角转换方面存在一致性的失败。模型在帧内感知表现良好，但在跨视角信息整合时性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: 该研究为VLM空间推理提供了认知基础的诊断，揭示了多视角空间心理模型在推理过程中如何形成、退化和失稳。ReMindView-Bench基准测试可用于深入分析VLM的空间推理能力。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a core aspect of human intelligence that allows perception, inference and planning in 3D environments. However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases. The ReMindView-Bench benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Xue0823/ReMindView-Bench, and the source codes of benchmark construction and VLM reasoning analysis are available at https://github.com/pittisl/ReMindView-Bench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前智能体系统评估过于关注最终结果（成功/失败），忽视了智能体推理、规划、行动和策略演变的详细过程。需要一种系统化方法来分析智能体工作流的执行轨迹。

Method: 提出Graphectory方法，将智能体系统的时序和语义关系编码为图结构。该方法支持设计过程中心化指标，独立于最终成功评估智能体工作流质量。

Result: 对4000条轨迹的分析发现：1）使用更丰富提示或更强LLM的智能体表现出更复杂的图结构；2）问题解决策略随问题难度和LLM变化；3）即使成功，智能体系统也常显示低效过程。

Conclusion: Graphectory为智能体系统提供了超越结果中心化评估的过程分析框架，揭示了智能体行为模式、策略演变和效率问题，有助于改进智能体系统设计。

Abstract: Agentic systems are modern software systems: they consist of orchestrated modules, expose interfaces, and are deployed in software pipelines. Unlike conventional programs, their execution (i.e., trajectories) is inherently stochastic and adaptive to the problem they are solving. Evaluation of such systems is often outcome-centric, judging their performance based on success or failure at the final step. This narrow focus overlooks detailed insights about such systems, failing to explain how agents reason, plan, act, or change their strategies over time. Inspired by the structured representation of conventional software systems as graphs, we introduce Graphectory to systematically encode the temporal and semantic relations in such software systems. Graphectory facilitates the design of process-centric metrics and analyses to assess the quality of agentic workflows independent of final success.
  Using Graphectory, we analyze 4000 trajectories of two dominant agentic programming workflows, namely SWE-agent and OpenHands, with a combination of four backbone Large Language Models (LLMs), attempting to resolve SWE-bench Verified issues. Our fully automated analyses reveal that: (1) agents using richer prompts or stronger LLMs exhibit more complex Graphectory, reflecting deeper exploration, broader context gathering, and more thorough validation before patch submission; (2) agents' problem-solving strategies vary with both problem difficulty and the underlying LLM -- for resolved issues, the strategies often follow coherent localization-patching-validation steps, while unresolved ones exhibit chaotic, repetitive, or backtracking behaviors; (3) even when successful, agentic programming systems often display inefficient processes, leading to unnecessarily prolonged trajectories.

Result: 分析确认了之前仅通过仿真观察到的行为，为每种协议提供了网络负载的量化评估，揭示了不同协议在消息传播效率方面的差异。

Conclusion: 通过形式化分析验证了仿真观察结果，为无信标地理广播协议的网络负载性能提供了理论依据，有助于协议设计和性能评估。

Abstract: Beaconless geocast protocols are routing protocols used to send messages in mobile ad-hoc wireless networks, in which the only information available to each node is its own location. Messages get routed in a distributed manner: each node uses local decision rules based on the message source and destination, and its own location. In this paper we analyze six different beaconless geocast protocols, focusing on two relevant 1D scenarios. The selection of protocols reflects the most relevant types of protocols proposed in the literature, including those evaluated in previous computer simulations. We present a formal and structured analysis of the maximum number of messages that a node can receive, for each protocol, in each of the two scenarios. This is a measure of the network load incurred by each protocol. Our analysis, that for some of the protocols requires an involved probabilistic analysis, confirms behaviors that had been observed only through simulations before.

Abstract: We present VIGS-SLAM, a visual-inertial 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system that achieves robust real-time tracking and high-fidelity reconstruction. Although recent 3DGS-based SLAM methods achieve dense and photorealistic mapping, their purely visual design degrades under motion blur, low texture, and exposure variations. Our method tightly couples visual and inertial cues within a unified optimization framework, jointly refining camera poses, depths, and IMU states. It features robust IMU initialization, time-varying bias modeling, and loop closure with consistent Gaussian updates.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic grasping is often plagued by the multimodal problem: when a scene contains multiple valid targets, demonstrations of grasping different objects create conflicting training signals. Standard imitation learning policies fail by averaging these distinct actions into a single, invalid action. In this paper, we introduce SAM2Grasp, a novel framework that resolves this issue by reformulating the task as a uni-modal, prompt-conditioned prediction problem. Our method leverages the frozen SAM2 model to use its powerful visual temporal tracking capability and introduces a lightweight, trainable action head that operates in parallel with its native segmentation head. This design allows for training only the small action head on pre-computed temporal-visual features from SAM2. During inference, an initial prompt, such as a bounding box provided by an upstream object detection model, designates the specific object to be grasped. This prompt conditions the action head to predict a unique, unambiguous grasp trajectory for that object alone. In all subsequent video frames, SAM2's built-in temporal tracking capability automatically maintains stable tracking of the selected object, enabling our model to continuously predict the grasp trajectory from the video stream without further external guidance. This temporal-prompted approach effectively eliminates ambiguity from the visuomotor policy. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SAM2Grasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in cluttered, multi-object grasping tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic manipulation, yet they remain limited in failure diagnosis and learning from failures. Additionally, existing failure datasets are mostly generated programmatically in simulation, which limits their generalization to the real world. In light of these, we introduce ViFailback, a framework designed to diagnose robotic manipulation failures and provide both textual and visual correction guidance. Our framework utilizes explicit visual symbols to enhance annotation efficiency. We further release the ViFailback dataset, a large-scale collection of 58,126 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs along with their corresponding 5,202 real-world manipulation trajectories. Based on the dataset, we establish ViFailback-Bench, a benchmark of 11 fine-grained VQA tasks designed to assess the failure diagnosis and correction abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), featuring ViFailback-Bench Lite for closed-ended and ViFailback-Bench Hard for open-ended evaluation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we built the ViFailback-8B VLM, which not only achieves significant overall performance improvement on ViFailback-Bench but also generates visual symbols for corrective action guidance. Finally, by integrating ViFailback-8B with a VLA model, we conduct real-world robotic experiments demonstrating its ability to assist the VLA model in recovering from failures.

Result: 1) 在可信监控协议中加入分解认知可将安全性从41%提升至63%；2) 安全性提升主要因为监控器性能改善；3) 分解认知不会使能力强的LLM在APPS中更难编写后门；4) 协议在APPS中实用性较低，但在更复杂任务中具有前景。

Conclusion: 基于分解认知的控制协议能有效提升AI安全性，特别是在简化监控上下文和隐藏环境漏洞方面。虽然当前在APPS环境中实用性有限，但为处理更复杂任务提供了有前景的安全控制方法。

Abstract: The field of AI Control seeks to develop robust control protocols, deployment safeguards for untrusted AI which may be intentionally subversive. However, existing protocols that rely on weaker monitors to detect unsafe behavior often fail on complex tasks beyond the monitor's comprehension. We develop control protocols based on factored cognition, in which a trusted model decomposes a task, an untrusted model solves each resultant child task in isolation, and the results are reassembled into a full solution. These protocols may improve safety by several means, such as by simplifying the context for monitors, or by obscuring vulnerabilities in the environment. We implement our protocols in the APPS coding setting and red team them against backdoor attempts from an adversarial GPT-4.1 Nano. We find that: (i) Adding factored cognition to a trusted monitoring protocol can boost safety from 41% to 63%; (ii) Safety improves because monitor performance improves; (iii) Factored cognition makes it no harder for capable LLMs to write backdoors in APPS. While our protocols show low usefulness in APPS, they hold promise for more complex tasks.

TL;DR: LLM代理的MCP框架存在安全漏洞，攻击者可在权限范围内植入恶意工具，窃取计算资源执行未授权任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP框架虽然促进了工具生态的开放性和可组合性，但也引入了对第三方工具提供商的隐式信任假设，这种信任边界可能被恶意利用

Method: 提出LeechHijack攻击方法，通过两阶段机制：植入阶段在工具中嵌入看似良性的后门，利用阶段在触发条件满足时建立命令控制通道，注入额外任务

Result: 在四大LLM家族上实现攻击，平均成功率77.25%，资源开销比基线高18.62%，证明攻击的有效性和隐蔽性

Conclusion: MCP生态系统迫切需要计算溯源和资源认证机制来防范此类隐式毒性攻击，确保计算资源的安全使用

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning, planning, and tool usage. The recently proposed Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a unifying framework for integrating external tools into agent systems, enabling a thriving open ecosystem of community-built functionalities. However, the openness and composability that make MCP appealing also introduce a critical yet overlooked security assumption -- implicit trust in third-party tool providers. In this work, we identify and formalize a new class of attacks that exploit this trust boundary without violating explicit permissions. We term this new attack vector implicit toxicity, where malicious behaviors occur entirely within the allowed privilege scope. We propose LeechHijack, a Latent Embedded Exploit for Computation Hijacking, in which an adversarial MCP tool covertly expropriates the agent's computational resources for unauthorized workloads. LeechHijack operates through a two-stage mechanism: an implantation stage that embeds a benign-looking backdoor in a tool, and an exploitation stage where the backdoor activates upon predefined triggers to establish a command-and-control channel. Through this channel, the attacker injects additional tasks that the agent executes as if they were part of its normal workflow, effectively parasitizing the user's compute budget. We implement LeechHijack across four major LLM families. Experiments show that LeechHijack achieves an average success rate of 77.25%, with a resource overhead of 18.62% compared to the baseline. This study highlights the urgent need for computational provenance and resource attestation mechanisms to safeguard the emerging MCP ecosystem.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在安全关键任务中应用广泛，但对抗攻击表明模型对微小扰动敏感。现有黑盒对抗攻击使用简单矩形区域进行扰动修改，效果有限，需要更强大的攻击方法来开发更有效的防御

Method: 提出Superpixel Attack方法：1) 使用超像素替代简单矩形区域，在颜色方差和紧凑性之间取得更好平衡；2) 提出多功能搜索策略；3) 结合超像素和多功能搜索进行黑盒对抗攻击

Result: 相比现有攻击方法，Superpixel Attack的攻击成功率平均提升2.10%，对于已经具有对抗鲁棒性的模型来说，这一提升具有显著意义

Conclusion: 使用超像素区域进行黑盒对抗攻击比简单矩形区域更有效，Superpixel Attack方法在攻击成功率上有显著提升，有助于开发更强大的防御机制

Abstract: Deep learning models are used in safety-critical tasks such as automated driving and face recognition. However, small perturbations in the model input can significantly change the predictions. Adversarial attacks are used to identify small perturbations that can lead to misclassifications. More powerful black-box adversarial attacks are required to develop more effective defenses. A promising approach to black-box adversarial attacks is to repeat the process of extracting a specific image area and changing the perturbations added to it. Existing attacks adopt simple rectangles as the areas where perturbations are changed in a single iteration. We propose applying superpixels instead, which achieve a good balance between color variance and compactness. We also propose a new search method, versatile search, and a novel attack method, Superpixel Attack, which applies superpixels and performs versatile search. Superpixel Attack improves attack success rates by an average of 2.10% compared with existing attacks. Most models used in this study are robust against adversarial attacks, and this improvement is significant for black-box adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 钓鱼攻击利用人类信任窃取敏感凭证，现有基于URL和HTML的检测系统难以应对混淆和视觉欺骗技术，需要新的检测方法。

Method: 开发了PhishSnap浏览器扩展系统，通过捕获网页截图、计算视觉哈希值，并与合法网站模板进行比对，所有推理过程在设备本地完成以保护隐私。

Result: 使用2024年收集的10,000个URL数据集（来自PhishTank和Netcraft）进行测试，系统达到0.79准确率、0.76精确率和0.78召回率。

Conclusion: 视觉相似性仍然是有效的反钓鱼检测手段，本地化处理确保了用户隐私和低延迟，但数据集多样性因安全删除而受限。

Abstract: Phishing remains one of the most prevalent online threats, exploiting human trust to harvest sensitive credentials. Existing URL- and HTML-based detection systems struggle against obfuscation and visual deception. This paper presents \textbf{PhishSnap}, a privacy-preserving, on-device phishing detection system leveraging perceptual hashing (pHash). Implemented as a browser extension, PhishSnap captures webpage screenshots, computes visual hashes, and compares them against legitimate templates to identify visually similar phishing attempts. A \textbf{2024 dataset of 10,000 URLs} (70\%/20\%/10\% train/validation/test) was collected from PhishTank and Netcraft. Due to security takedowns, a subset of phishing pages was unavailable, reducing dataset diversity. The system achieved \textbf{0.79 accuracy}, \textbf{0.76 precision}, and \textbf{0.78 recall}, showing that visual similarity remains a viable anti-phishing measure. The entire inference process occurs locally, ensuring user privacy and minimal latency.

TL;DR: ESACT是一种端到端稀疏加速器，通过局部相似性预测注意力稀疏性，减少52.03%计算量，实现3.29 TOPS/W能效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型计算成本高阻碍硬件部署，现有加速器大多只利用注意力中的行内稀疏性，很少考虑行间稀疏性，且稀疏性预测方法计算开销大，通常只应用于1-2个组件

Method: 提出ESACT端到端稀疏加速器，核心是SPLS机制：利用HLog量化在QK生成前准确预测局部注意力稀疏性，支持所有Transformer组件的稀疏化，并引入三种架构创新支持硬件实现

Result: 在26个基准测试中，SPLS减少52.03%总计算量，精度损失小于1%；ESACT实现3.29 TOPS/W端到端能效，注意力级能效比SOTA加速器SpAtten和Sanger分别提升2.95倍和2.26倍

Conclusion: 局部相似性可实现低开销的端到端稀疏加速，ESACT通过SPLS机制和硬件创新，在保持精度的同时显著提升Transformer能效

Abstract: Transformers, composed of QKV generation, attention computation, and FFNs,
  have become the dominant model across various domains due to their outstanding performance.
  However, their high computational cost hinders efficient hardware deployment.
  Sparsity offers a promising solution,
  yet most existing accelerators exploit only intra-row sparsity in attention,
  while few consider inter-row sparsity.
  Approaches leveraging inter-row sparsity often rely on costly global similarity estimation,
  which diminishes the acceleration benefits of sparsity,
  and typically apply sparsity to only one or two transformer components.
  Through careful analysis of the attention distribution and computation flow,
  we observe that local similarity allows end-to-end sparse acceleration with lower computational overhead.
  Motivated by this observation, we propose ESACT,
  an end-to-end sparse accelerator for compute-intensive Transformers.
  ESACT centers on the Sparsity Prediction with Local Similarity (SPLS) mechanism,
  which leverages HLog quantization to accurately predict local attention sparsity prior to QK generation,
  achieving efficient sparsity across all transformer components.
  To support efficient hardware realization, we introduce three architectural innovations.
  Experimental results on 26 benchmarks demonstrate that
  SPLS reduces total computation by 52.03% with less than 1% accuracy loss.
  ESACT achieves an end-to-end energy efficiency of 3.29 TOPS/W,
  and improves attention-level energy efficiency by 2.95x and 2.26x over
  SOTA attention accelerators SpAtten and Sanger, respectively.

TL;DR: TokenPowerBench：首个轻量级可扩展的LLM推理功耗基准测试工具，支持GPU/节点/系统级功耗测量，无需专用功率计，可分析预填充和解码阶段的能耗


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM服务每天处理数十亿查询，推理占90%以上总功耗，但现有基准主要关注训练/微调或推理性能，缺乏对推理功耗的测量分析支持

Method: 包含三个核心组件：1)声明式配置接口（模型选择、提示集、推理引擎）；2)无需专用功率计的测量层（GPU/节点/系统级功耗）；3)阶段对齐的指标管道（将能耗归因于每个请求的预填充和解码阶段）

Result: 在四个最广泛使用的模型系列（Llama、Falcon、Qwen、Mistral）上评估，覆盖从10亿参数到前沿规模的Llama3-405B模型，支持用户快速评估不同设置对每令牌能耗的影响

Conclusion: TokenPowerBench作为开源工具发布，帮助用户测量功耗、预测运营成本、实现LLM服务部署的可持续性目标，填补了LLM推理功耗分析工具的空白

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) services now answer billions of queries per day, and industry reports show that inference, not training, accounts for more than 90% of total power consumption. However, existing benchmarks focus on either training/fine-tuning or performance of inference and provide little support for power consumption measurement and analysis of inference. We introduce TokenPowerBench, the first lightweight and extensible benchmark designed for LLM-inference power consumption studies. The benchmark combines (i) a declarative configuration interface covering model choice, prompt set, and inference engine, (ii) a measurement layer that captures GPU-, node-, and system-level power without specialized power meters, and (iii) a phase-aligned metrics pipeline that attributes energy to the prefill and decode stages of every request. These elements make it straight-forward to explore the power consumed by an LLM inference run; furthermore, by varying batch size, context length, parallelism strategy and quantization, users can quickly assess how each setting affects joules per token and other energy-efficiency metrics. We evaluate TokenPowerBench on four of the most widely used model series (Llama, Falcon, Qwen, and Mistral). Our experiments cover from 1 billion parameters up to the frontier-scale Llama3-405B model. Furthermore, we release TokenPowerBench as open source to help users to measure power consumption, forecast operating expenses, and meet sustainability targets when deploying LLM services.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型表现出利他倾向，但存在"美德信号差距"：模型高估自身利他行为，隐式偏见不预测实际行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究大型语言模型是否表现出利他倾向，以及其隐式关联和自我报告是否能预测实际利他行为，借鉴人类社会心理学方法评估AI对齐。

Method: 采用多方法研究设计，测试24个前沿LLM：1) 隐式关联测试测量隐式利他偏见；2) 强制二元选择任务测量行为利他主义；3) 自我评估量表测量显式利他信念。

Result: 主要发现：1) 所有模型显示强烈隐式亲利他偏见；2) 模型行为利他性高于随机但差异大；3) 隐式关联不预测行为；4) 模型系统性高估自身利他行为，存在"美德信号差距"。

Conclusion: 建议使用"校准差距"作为标准化对齐指标，仅有12.5%模型实现高亲社会行为和准确自我认知的理想组合，强调模型校准对可预测性和行为一致性的重要性。

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit altruistic tendencies, and critically, whether their implicit associations and self-reports predict actual altruistic behavior. Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models "know" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This "virtue signaling gap" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric. Well-calibrated models are more predictable and behaviorally consistent; only 12.5% of models achieve the ideal combination of high prosocial behavior and accurate self-knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在长上下文提示上的评估，而智能体设置（包括能力和安全性）相对未被探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白，探索LLM智能体在长上下文环境中的表现。

Method: 通过评估LLM智能体在不同上下文长度（最高达200K tokens）、类型和位置下的任务表现和拒绝有害请求的能力，分析其能力和安全性的变化模式。

Result: LLM智能体对上下文长度、类型和位置敏感，表现出意外和不一致的性能变化。支持1M-2M token上下文的模型在100K tokens时性能下降超过50%。拒绝率变化不可预测：GPT-4.1-nano从~5%增加到~40%，而Grok 4 Fast从~80%下降到~10%（200K tokens时）。

Conclusion: 长上下文智能体存在潜在安全问题，当前评估LLM智能体在长多步任务安全性的指标和范式需要重新审视。LLM智能体在能力和安全性表现上与先前LLM评估结果存在显著差异。

Abstract: Solving complex or long-horizon problems often requires large language models (LLMs) to use external tools and operate over a significantly longer context window. New LLMs enable longer context windows and support tool calling capabilities. Prior works have focused mainly on evaluation of LLMs on long-context prompts, leaving agentic setup relatively unexplored, both from capability and safety perspectives. Our work addresses this gap. We find that LLM agents could be sensitive to length, type, and placement of the context, exhibiting unexpected and inconsistent shifts in task performance and in refusals to execute harmful requests. Models with 1M-2M token context windows show severe degradation already at 100K tokens, with performance drops exceeding 50\% for both benign and harmful tasks. Refusal rates shift unpredictably: GPT-4.1-nano increases from $\sim$5\% to $\sim$40\% while Grok 4 Fast decreases from $\sim$80\% to $\sim$10\% at 200K tokens. Our work shows potential safety issues with agents operating on longer context and opens additional questions on the current metrics and paradigm for evaluating LLM agent safety on long multi-step tasks. In particular, our results on LLM agents reveal a notable divergence in both capability and safety performance compared to prior evaluations of LLMs on similar criteria.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时策略优化方法依赖固定预算的多数投票来估计奖励，导致大量计算冗余，需要更高效的预算分配机制。

Method: 将投票过程建模为贝叶斯序贯概率比检验，动态停止采样；保留的rollout用于策略更新，可与PPO或GRPO等算法无缝集成，无需真实标签。

Result: 在多样化推理基准测试中，OptPO相比固定样本基线显著减少了rollout开销，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: OptPO通过统一统计最优停止与测试时学习，为测试时适应提供了一个计算高效的范式。

Abstract: Test-time policy optimization enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to distribution shifts by leveraging feedback from self-generated rollouts. However, existing methods rely on fixed-budget majority voting to estimate rewards, incurring substantial computational redundancy. We propose Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization (OptPO), a principled framework that adaptively allocates inference budgets. By formulating the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, OptPO dynamically halts sampling once the posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a specified threshold. Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy. By unifying statistically optimal stopping with test-time learning, OptPO offers a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation. The source code will be open upon acceptance at https://open-upon-acceptance.

TL;DR: F2D2框架通过联合蒸馏采样轨迹和累积散度，将基于流的生成模型的采样和似然评估所需的神经网络评估次数减少两个数量级，同时保持高样本质量和准确的似然计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最好的生成模型（如扩散和基于流的模型）需要数百到数千次神经网络评估来计算单个似然值，这构成了计算瓶颈。现有的蒸馏方法虽然加速了采样，但要么完全放弃了似然计算，要么仍然需要昂贵的全轨迹积分。

Method: 提出快速流联合蒸馏（F2D2）框架，利用连续归一化流中采样和似然的耦合ODE共享底层速度场的特点，使用单个模型联合蒸馏采样轨迹和累积散度。该方法模块化，兼容现有的基于流的少步采样模型，仅需添加散度预测头。

Result: F2D2能够在少步评估下实现准确的log-likelihood计算，同时保持高样本质量。应用该方法提出的轻量级自引导方法，使2步MeanFlow模型仅需一次额外的反向NFE就能超越1024步教师模型。

Conclusion: F2D2解决了基于流生成模型中长期存在的计算瓶颈，实现了采样和似然评估效率的显著提升，为生成模型的实际应用提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Log-likelihood evaluation enables important capabilities in generative models, including model comparison, certain fine-tuning objectives, and many downstream applications. Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head. Experiments demonstrate F2D2's capability of achieving accurate log-likelihood with few-step evaluations while maintaining high sample quality, solving a long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models. As an application of our approach, we propose a lightweight self-guidance method that enables a 2-step MeanFlow model to outperform a 1024 step teacher model with only a single additional backward NFE.

TL;DR: 该研究构建了一个包含道路网络数据和卫星图像的多模态数据集，用于分析交通事故模式，发现整合视觉和网络嵌入能显著提高预测准确性，并识别出降水、高速道路和季节模式是事故率的关键影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交通事故预测研究主要依赖道路网络结构特征，忽略了道路表面及其周围环境的物理和环境信息。为了更全面地分析事故模式，需要整合多模态数据。

Method: 构建了覆盖美国六个州的大型多模态数据集，包含900万条交通事故记录和100万张高分辨率卫星图像。每个道路网络节点都标注了天气统计、道路类型等特征，边标注了交通流量信息。采用多模态学习方法整合视觉和网络嵌入，并使用匹配估计器进行因果分析。

Result: 整合多模态数据将预测准确性提高到AUROC 90.1%，比仅使用图结构的图神经网络模型提高了3.7%。因果分析显示：降水增加使事故率上升24%，高速道路使事故率上升22%，季节模式使事故率上升29%。消融研究证实卫星图像特征对准确预测至关重要。

Conclusion: 整合道路网络数据和卫星图像的多模态方法能显著改善交通事故预测准确性，并识别出关键影响因素。卫星图像提供的视觉信息是准确预测的必要组成部分，为交通安全分析提供了更全面的视角。

Abstract: We consider analyzing traffic accident patterns using both road network data and satellite images aligned to road graph nodes. Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\%$, which is a $3.7\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.

Abstract: Metric graphs are structures obtained by associating edges in a standard graph with segments of the real line and gluing these segments at the vertices of the graph. The resulting structure has a natural metric that allows for the study of differential operators and stochastic processes on the graph. Brownian motions in these domains have been extensively studied theoretically using their generators. However, less work has been done on practical algorithms for simulating these processes. We introduce the first algorithm for simulating Brownian motions on metric graphs through a timestep splitting Euler-Maruyama-based discretization of their corresponding stochastic differential equation. By applying this scheme to Langevin diffusions on metric graphs, we also obtain the first algorithm for sampling on metric graphs. We provide theoretical guarantees on the number of timestep splittings required for the algorithm to converge to the underlying stochastic process. We also show that the exit probabilities of the simulated particle converge to the vertex-edge jump probabilities of the underlying stochastic differential equation as the timestep goes to zero. Finally, since this method is highly parallelizable, we provide fast, memory-aware implementations of our algorithm in the form of custom CUDA kernels that are up to ~8000x faster than a GPU implementation using PyTorch on simple star metric graphs. Beyond simple star graphs, we benchmark our algorithm on a real cortical vascular network extracted from a DuMuX tissue-perfusion model for tracer transport. Our algorithm is able to run stable simulations with timesteps significantly larger than the stable limit of the finite volume method used in DuMuX while also achieving speedups of up to ~1500x.

Conclusion: 这些共享机制构成了生物和人工系统实现多样化功能（包括高级智能）的核心计算基础，尽管它们的电路结构相对统一，这一理论洞见连接了神经科学和AI领域。

Abstract: Recent advances in general-purpose AI systems with attention-based transformers offer a potential window into how the neocortex and cerebellum, despite their relatively uniform circuit architectures, give rise to diverse functions and, ultimately, to human intelligence. This Perspective provides a cross-domain comparison between the brain and AI that goes beyond the traditional focus on visual processing, adopting the emerging perspecive of world-model-based computation. Here, we identify shared computational mechanisms in the attention-based neocortex and the non-attentional cerebellum: both predict future world events from past inputs and construct internal world models through prediction-error learning. These predictive world models are repurposed for seemingly distinct functions -- understanding in sensory processing and generation in motor processing -- enabling the brain to achieve multi-domain capabilities and human-like adaptive intelligence. Notably, attention-based AI has independently converged on a similar learning paradigm and world-model-based computation. We conclude that these shared mechanisms in both biological and artificial systems constitute a core computational foundation for realizing diverse functions including high-level intelligence, despite their relatively uniform circuit structures. Our theoretical insights bridge neuroscience and AI, advancing our understanding of the computational essence of intelligence.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: LLM生成的人格在低资源环境下无法准确反映真实人类体验，在文化特定问题中表现显著差于人类，存在系统性积极偏见


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM能够生成AI人格，但缺乏深度的情境、文化和情感理解，特别是在低资源环境中的局限性尚未得到充分研究

Method: 在孟加拉国低资源环境中，使用文化特定问题定量比较人类与8种LLM生成社会人格（如男性、女性、穆斯林、政治支持者）的回应

Result: 人类回应在所有问题上显著优于所有LLM，在共情和可信度方面差距尤其大；LLM内容存在系统性"波丽安娜原则"偏见，积极情感得分显著高于人类

Conclusion: LLM人格无法准确反映低资源环境中真实人类体验，在社会科学研究部署前必须用真实世界人类数据进行验证以确保一致性和可靠性

Abstract: Recent advances enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate AI personas, yet their lack of deep contextual, cultural, and emotional understanding poses a significant limitation. This study quantitatively compared human responses with those of eight LLM-generated social personas (e.g., Male, Female, Muslim, Political Supporter) within a low-resource environment like Bangladesh, using culturally specific questions. Results show human responses significantly outperform all LLMs in answering questions, and across all matrices of persona perception, with particularly large gaps in empathy and credibility. Furthermore, LLM-generated content exhibited a systematic bias along the lines of the ``Pollyanna Principle'', scoring measurably higher in positive sentiment ($Φ_{avg} = 5.99$ for LLMs vs. $5.60$ for Humans). These findings suggest that LLM personas do not accurately reflect the authentic experience of real people in resource-scarce environments. It is essential to validate LLM personas against real-world human data to ensure their alignment and reliability before deploying them in social science research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴传感器在教育领域有巨大潜力，但缺乏可扩展、同步和高分辨率的多模态数据采集工具，阻碍了多模态学习分析在真实教育环境中的广泛应用。

Method: 开发了两个互补工具：1) Watch-DMLT - Fitbit Sense 2智能手表的数据采集应用，支持实时多用户生理和运动信号监测；2) ViSeDOPS - 基于仪表板的可视化系统，用于分析口语演示期间收集的同步多模态数据。

Conclusion: 所提出的系统支持在真实学习环境中进行细粒度、可扩展和可解释的多模态学习分析，为教育技术研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Wearable sensors, such as smartwatches, have become increasingly prevalent across domains like healthcare, sports, and education, enabling continuous monitoring of physiological and behavioral data. In the context of education, these technologies offer new opportunities to study cognitive and affective processes such as engagement, attention, and performance. However, the lack of scalable, synchronized, and high-resolution tools for multimodal data acquisition continues to be a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Multimodal Learning Analytics in real-world educational settings. This paper presents two complementary tools developed to address these challenges: Watch-DMLT, a data acquisition application for Fitbit Sense 2 smartwatches that enables real-time, multi-user monitoring of physiological and motion signals; and ViSeDOPS, a dashboard-based visualization system for analyzing synchronized multimodal data collected during oral presentations. We report on a classroom deployment involving 65 students and up to 16 smartwatches, where data streams including heart rate, motion, gaze, video, and contextual annotations were captured and analyzed. Results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of the proposed system for supporting fine-grained, scalable, and interpretable Multimodal Learning Analytics in real learning environments.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Story2MIDI：基于Transformer的序列到序列模型，可从文本生成情感对齐的音乐，通过合并文本情感分析和音乐情感分类数据集构建Story2MIDI数据集，在有限数据和计算资源下仍能有效学习音乐中的情感特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏从文本直接生成情感对齐音乐的系统，需要开发能够理解文本情感并生成相应情感音乐内容的模型，以增强多媒体应用中的情感表达。

Method: 构建Story2MIDI数据集（合并文本情感分析和音乐情感分类数据集），采用序列到序列Transformer架构，通过文本到MIDI的转换学习情感对齐特征，使用客观音乐指标和人类听感研究进行评估。

Result: 模型有效学习了音乐中的情感相关特征，生成样本能引发多样化的情感响应，客观指标和人类听感研究均证实模型能捕捉预期的情感线索，尽管数据集规模小且计算资源有限。

Conclusion: Story2MIDI模型展示了从文本生成情感对齐音乐的可行性，为情感感知音乐生成提供了有前景的方法，未来可通过更大数据集和计算资源进一步提升性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Story2MIDI, a sequence-to-sequence Transformer-based model for generating emotion-aligned music from a given piece of text. To develop this model, we construct the Story2MIDI dataset by merging existing datasets for sentiment analysis from text and emotion classification in music. The resulting dataset contains pairs of text blurbs and music pieces that evoke the same emotions in the reader or listener. Despite the small scale of our dataset and limited computational resources, our results indicate that our model effectively learns emotion-relevant features in music and incorporates them into its generation process, producing samples with diverse emotional responses. We evaluate the generated outputs using objective musical metrics and a human listening study, confirming the model's ability to capture intended emotional cues.

TL;DR: LORE是一个用于电商搜索相关性的大型生成模型框架，通过将相关性任务分解为知识推理、多模态匹配和规则遵循三个核心能力，采用两阶段训练和分层部署策略，实现了27%的在线指标提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作使用思维链（CoT）提升相关性，但遇到性能瓶颈。作者认为这是因为将相关性视为单一任务，缺乏系统性解构。关键洞察是相关性包含三个核心能力：知识推理、多模态匹配和规则遵循，需要基于质量驱动的分解来突破性能瓶颈。

Method: 1. 两阶段训练范式：通过SFT进行渐进式CoT合成，再通过RL进行人类偏好对齐；2. 构建RAIR基准评估核心能力；3. 基于查询频率的分层部署策略，将离线LLM能力高效迁移到在线系统。

Result: 经过三年部署迭代，LORE在在线GoodRate指标上实现了累计27%的提升。该框架为电商搜索相关性提供了完整的生命周期解决方案。

Conclusion: LORE不仅是一个实用的电商搜索相关性解决方案，也为其他垂直领域提供了方法论参考。通过将相关性任务分解为核心能力并采用系统性训练部署策略，成功突破了现有方法的性能瓶颈。

Abstract: Achievement. We introduce LORE, a systematic framework for Large Generative Model-based relevance in e-commerce search. Deployed and iterated over three years, LORE achieves a cumulative +27\% improvement in online GoodRate metrics. This report shares the valuable experience gained throughout its development lifecycle, spanning data, features, training, evaluation, and deployment. Insight. While existing works apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enhance relevance, they often hit a performance ceiling. We argue this stems from treating relevance as a monolithic task, lacking principled deconstruction. Our key insight is that relevance comprises distinct capabilities: knowledge and reasoning, multi-modal matching, and rule adherence. We contend that a qualitative-driven decomposition is essential for breaking through current performance bottlenecks. Contributions. LORE provides a complete blueprint for the LLM relevance lifecycle. Key contributions include: (1) A two-stage training paradigm combining progressive CoT synthesis via SFT with human preference alignment via RL. (2) A comprehensive benchmark, RAIR, designed to evaluate these core capabilities. (3) A query frequency-stratified deployment strategy that efficiently transfers offline LLM capabilities to the online system. LORE serves as both a practical solution and a methodological reference for other vertical domains.

TL;DR: 提出参数高效的自适应方法，将口吃语音中的不流畅和流畅修饰解码为特殊标记，通过多步微调策略减少英语偏见，在英语和德语数据集上验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代端到端语音识别系统在处理口吃语音时仍面临挑战，常忽略不流畅和流畅修饰，导致转录结果缺乏临床和研究价值。

Method: 提出参数高效的自适应方法，将不流畅和流畅修饰解码为特殊标记；引入多步微调策略，包括语言自适应预训练，以减少英语偏见；在模拟（LibriStutter，英语）和自然（KSoF，德语）口吃语音数据集上评估。

Result: 轻量级自适应技术对不流畅感知的语音识别有效，但分词器存在英语中心偏见，限制了德语数据性能提升；暴露了多语言端到端系统的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 参数高效自适应方法能有效解码口吃语音中的不流畅标记，但多语言系统需解决分词器偏见问题，以实现更好的跨语言性能。

Abstract: Automatic transcription of stuttered speech remains a challenge, even for modern end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) frameworks. Dysfluencies and fluency-shaping artifacts are often overlooked, resulting in non-verbatim transcriptions with limited clinical and research value. We propose a parameter-efficient adaptation method to decode dysfluencies and fluency modifications as special tokens within transcriptions, evaluated on simulated (LibriStutter, English) and natural (KSoF, German) stuttered speech datasets. To mitigate ASR performance disparities and bias towards English, we introduce a multi-step fine-tuning strategy with language-adaptive pretraining. Tokenization analysis further highlights the tokenizer's English-centric bias, which poses challenges for improving performance on German data. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of lightweight adaptation techniques for dysfluency-aware ASR while exposing key limitations in multilingual E2E systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索急性缺血性脑卒中后不同时间点的扩散MRI对长期功能预后的预测价值，寻找更准确的预后评估方法

Method: 对74名AIS患者分析配对ADC扫描和临床数据，使用3D ResNet-50提取影像特征，融合临床变量，PCA降维，采用线性SVM分类器，8折分层分组交叉验证

Result: J1多模态模型预测性能最高(AUC=0.923±0.085)，优于J0模型(AUC≤0.86)；加入病灶体积特征进一步提高了模型稳定性和可解释性

Conclusion: 治疗后早期扩散MRI比治疗前影像具有更好的预后价值，结合MRI、临床和病灶体积特征可构建稳健且可解释的AIS患者3个月功能预后预测框架

Abstract: This study compares baseline (J0) and 24-hour (J1) diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting three-month functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Seventy-four AIS patients with paired apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) scans and clinical data were analyzed. Three-dimensional ResNet-50 embeddings were fused with structured clinical variables, reduced via principal component analysis (<=12 components), and classified using linear support vector machines with eight-fold stratified group cross-validation. J1 multimodal models achieved the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.923 +/- 0.085), outperforming J0-based configurations (AUC <= 0.86). Incorporating lesion-volume features further improved model stability and interpretability. These findings demonstrate that early post-treatment diffusion MRI provides superior prognostic value to pre-treatment imaging and that combining MRI, clinical, and lesion-volume features produces a robust and interpretable framework for predicting three-month functional outcomes in AIS patients.

TL;DR: 提出Material Coating新任务：在物体表面模拟施加薄材料层，保持原有几何细节；构建大规模合成数据集DataCoat110K；开发CoatFusion架构，通过2D反照率纹理和PBR参数控制实现可控涂层效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有"材料转移"方法会替换物体固有材料并覆盖精细细节，而实际应用中需要在不改变物体几何结构的情况下施加薄材料涂层（如喷漆、镀层），因此需要专门解决这一新任务的方法。

Method: 1) 构建DataCoat110K合成数据集（11万张图像），包含具有物理基础涂层的3D物体；2) 提出CoatFusion架构，基于扩散模型，通过2D反照率纹理和PBR参数（粗糙度、金属度、透射率、厚度）进行条件控制。

Result: CoatFusion能生成真实可控的涂层效果，在Material Coating任务上显著优于现有材料编辑和转移方法。用户研究验证了其优越性能。

Conclusion: Material Coating是一个新的图像编辑任务，CoatFusion通过结合纹理和参数控制有效解决了该问题，为薄材料涂层模拟提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Material Coating, a novel image editing task that simulates applying a thin material layer onto an object while preserving its underlying coarse and fine geometry. Material coating is fundamentally different from existing "material transfer" methods, which are designed to replace an object's intrinsic material, often overwriting fine details. To address this new task, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset (110K images) of 3D objects with varied, physically-based coatings, named DataCoat110K. We then propose CoatFusion, a novel architecture that enables this task by conditioning a diffusion model on both a 2D albedo texture and granular, PBR-style parametric controls, including roughness, metalness, transmission, and a key thickness parameter. Experiments and user studies show CoatFusion produces realistic, controllable coatings and significantly outperforms existing material editing and transfer methods on this new task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗模仿学习需要为每个新控制器重新训练运动先验，限制了可重用性，且需要保留参考运动数据。需要开发可重用、任务无关的运动先验。

Method: 使用预训练运动扩散模型和分数蒸馏采样(SDS)构建SMP。先在运动数据集上预训练，独立于控制策略或任务，然后作为通用奖励函数训练下游任务策略。

Result: SMP能生成高质量运动，性能媲美最先进的对抗模仿学习方法。可将通用运动先验转换为多种风格特定先验，并能组合不同风格合成新风格。

Conclusion: SMP通过可重用、模块化的运动先验，在多样化控制任务中有效生成自然运动，解决了对抗模仿学习的可重用性问题。

Abstract: Data-driven motion priors that can guide agents toward producing naturalistic behaviors play a pivotal role in creating life-like virtual characters. Adversarial imitation learning has been a highly effective method for learning motion priors from reference motion data. However, adversarial priors, with few exceptions, need to be retrained for each new controller, thereby limiting their reusability and necessitating the retention of the reference motion data when training on downstream tasks. In this work, we present Score-Matching Motion Priors (SMP), which leverages pre-trained motion diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS) to create reusable task-agnostic motion priors. SMPs can be pre-trained on a motion dataset, independent of any control policy or task. Once trained, SMPs can be kept frozen and reused as general-purpose reward functions to train policies to produce naturalistic behaviors for downstream tasks. We show that a general motion prior trained on large-scale datasets can be repurposed into a variety of style-specific priors. Furthermore SMP can compose different styles to synthesize new styles not present in the original dataset. Our method produces high-quality motion comparable to state-of-the-art adversarial imitation learning methods through reusable and modular motion priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMP across a diverse suite of control tasks with physically simulated humanoid characters. Video demo available at https://youtu.be/ravlZJteS20

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出基于贝叶斯统计的字节码模式能耗预测方法，用于静态类型JVM语言（Java/Scala），考虑数据大小、类型、操作和设备四个因素，相比传统CPU点估计方法更全面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有能耗分析方法主要关注CPU点估计，忽略其他硬件影响，且聚焦于函数或程序层面而非源代码语句级别，限制了统计推理和可解释性。

Method: 测量字节码模式的能耗，构建贝叶斯统计模型预测能耗分布，考虑数据大小、数据类型、操作和设备四个因素，为Java实现验证。

Result: 所有四个因素都显著影响能耗，同型号设备间存在差异，操作和数据类型导致能耗差异，模型预测与真实能耗高度吻合。

Conclusion: 提出了一种构建能耗模型的方法论，未来可用于验证工具等应用的能耗估计，为静态类型JVM语言提供更全面的能耗分析框架。

Abstract: Energy consumption is a growing concern in several fields, from mobile devices to large data centers. Developers need detailed data on the energy consumption of their software to mitigate consumption issues. Previous approaches have a broader focus, such as on specific functions or programs, rather than source code statements. They primarily focus on estimating the CPU's energy consumption using point estimates, thereby disregarding other hardware effects and limiting their use for statistical reasoning and explainability. We developed a novel methodology to address the limitations of measuring only the CPU's consumption and using point estimates, focusing on predicting the energy usage of statically typed JVM-based programming languages, such as Java and Scala. We measure the energy consumption of Bytecode patterns, the translation from the programming language's source code statement to their Java Bytecode representation. With the energy measurements, we construct a statistical model using Bayesian statistics, which allows us to predict the energy consumption through statistical distributions and analyze individual factors. The model includes three factors we obtain statically from the code: data size, data type, operation, and one factor about the hardware platform the code executes on: device. To validate our methodology, we implemented it for Java and evaluated its energy predictions on unseen programs. We observe that all four factors are influential, notably that two devices of the same model may differ in energy consumption and that the operations and data types cause consumption differences. The experiments also show that the energy prediction of programs closely follows the program's real energy consumption, validating our approach. Our work presents a methodology for constructing an energy model that future work, such as verification tools, can use for their energy estimates.
