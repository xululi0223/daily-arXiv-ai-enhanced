QLC 3D NAND flash\nstores 4 bit per cell to expand the storage density, resulting in narrower read\nmargins. Constrained to read margins, QLC always suffers from lateral charge\nmigration (LCM), which caused by non-uniform charge density across adjacent\nmemory cells. To suppress charge density gap between cells, there are some\nalgorithm in form of intra-page data mapping such as WBVM, DVDS. However, we\nobserve inter-page data arrangements also approach the suppression. Thus, we\nproposed an intelligent model PDA-LSTM to arrange intra-page data for LCM\nsuppression, which is a physics-knowledge-driven neural network model. PDA-LSTM\napplies a long-short term memory (LSTM) neural network to compute a data\narrangement probability matrix from input page data pattern. The arrangement is\nto minimize the global impacts derived from the LCM among wordlines. Since each\npage data can be arranged only once, we design a transformation from output\nmatrix of LSTM network to non-repetitive sequence generation probability matrix\nto assist training process. The arranged data pattern can decrease the bit\nerror rate (BER) during data retention. In addition, PDA-LSTM do not need extra\nflag bits to record data transport of 3D NAND flash compared with WBVM, DVDS.\nThe experiment results show that the PDA-LSTM reduces the average BER by 80.4%\ncompared with strategy without data arrangement, and by 18.4%, 15.2% compared\nrespectively with WBVM and DVDS with code-length 64."}

These results\ndemonstrate that attention based architectures enable reliable CSI recovery and\nenhanced spectral efficiency without compromising link quality, addressing a\nfundamental bottleneck in adaptive, low-overhead channel estimation for\nnon-stationary 5G and beyond-5G networks."}

By requiring only stability of\nmeasurement and frequency errors, we can circumvent existing lower bounds,\nleading to dramatic improvements under very general conditions.

We focus on prominent architectures such\nas BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT to examine their vulnerability to\ngender bias. To quantify the degree of bias, we introduce a novel metric,\nMALoR, which assesses bias based on model probabilities for filling masked\ntokens. We further propose a mitigation approach involving continued\npre-training on a gender-balanced dataset generated via Counterfactual Data\nAugmentation. Our experiments reveal significant reductions in gender bias\nscores across different pronoun pairs. For instance, in BERT-base, bias scores\nfor \"he-she\" dropped from 1.27 to 0.08, and \"his-her\" from 2.51 to 0.36\nfollowing our mitigation approach. We also observed similar improvements across\nother models, with \"male-female\" bias decreasing from 1.82 to 0.10 in\nBERT-large. Our approach effectively reduces gender bias without compromising\nmodel performance on downstream tasks."}

Improvements in memory and context size have\nallowed these models to become more autonomous, which has also resulted in more\ntext accumulation in their context windows without explicit user intervention.\nThis comes with a latent risk: the belief profiles of models -- their\nunderstanding of the world as manifested in their responses or actions -- may\nsilently change as context accumulates. This can lead to subtly inconsistent\nuser experiences, or shifts in behavior that deviate from the original\nalignment of the models. In this paper, we explore how accumulating context by\nengaging in interactions and processing text -- talking and reading -- can\nchange the beliefs of language models, as manifested in their responses and\nbehaviors.Our results reveal that models' belief profiles are highly malleable:\nGPT-5 exhibits a 54.7% shift in its stated beliefs after 10 rounds of\ndiscussion about moral dilemmas and queries about safety, while Grok 4 shows a\n27.2% shift on political issues after reading texts from the opposing position.\nWe also examine models' behavioral changes by designing tasks that require tool\nuse, where each tool selection corresponds to an implicit belief.

For example, activating the Black latent increases the risk assigned to\nthe probability that a patient will become \"belligerent\". We evaluate the\ndegree to which such steering via latents might be useful for mitigating bias.\nWe find that this offers improvements in simple settings, but is less\nsuccessful for more realistic and complex clinical tasks.

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel ethical reasoning paradigm for LLMs inspired by well-established ethical\ndecision-making models, aiming at enhancing diverse human value alignment\nthrough deliberative ethical reasoning.

This theory-grounded approach guides LLMs through an\ninterpretable reasoning process that enhances their ability to understand\nregional specificities and perform nuanced ethical analysis, which can be\nimplemented with either prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning methods.\nWe perform evaluations on the SafeWorld benchmark that specially designed for\nregional value alignment.

We propose\n\\textit{GrowthHacker}, a benchmark with agent and baseline methods on\nlarge-scale real-world datasets, which iteratively optimizes code, evaluates\nresults, and begins new optimization cycles. We collected datasets, established\nprotocols, implemented baselines for OPE on the Open Bandit Pipeline\n(OBP)~\\cite{saito2021openbanditdatasetpipeline} and\nScope-RL~\\cite{kiyohara2023scope}, and developed the \\textit{two_agent}\nframework, which reduces system complexity while preserving optimization\neffectiveness. Results show the two_agent framework achieves 100% reliability\nand the highest average improvement of 106.7% among positive outcomes. Both\ntwo_agent and CrewAI reach 45% success rates, outperforming AutoGen's 34%.\nThese findings demonstrate the feasibility of LLM-based agents as automated\n\"growth hackers\" to enhance OPE systems, with implications for scaling\ndata-driven decision-making in production."}

Moreover,\nour strategy focuses on using RL for challenging samples that are significantly\ndistant from the ground truth, and our RL approach is innovatively implemented\nusing MLLM-based IQA models to align distributions with high-quality images\ninitially. As the samples approach the ground truth's distribution, RL is\nadaptively combined with SFT for more fine-grained alignment. This dynamic\nprocess is facilitated through an automatic weighting strategy that adjusts\nbased on the relative difficulty of the training samples. Our strategy is\nplug-and-play that can be seamlessly applied to diffusion-based restoration\nmodels, boosting its performance across various restoration tasks. Extensive\nexperiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed RL framework."}

However, as they are typically optimized in\nsemantic latent space, where proximity does not guarantee physical correctness\nin visual space, they often produce unrealistic results, such as overexposed\nhighlights, misaligned shadows, and incorrect occlusions. We address this with\nUniLumos, a unified relighting framework for both images and videos that brings\nRGB-space geometry feedback into a flow matching backbone. By supervising the\nmodel with depth and normal maps extracted from its outputs, we explicitly\nalign lighting effects with the scene structure, enhancing physical\nplausibility. Nevertheless, this feedback requires high-quality outputs for\nsupervision in visual space, making standard multi-step denoising\ncomputationally expensive. To mitigate this, we employ path consistency\nlearning, allowing supervision to remain effective even under few-step training\nregimes. To enable fine-grained relighting control and supervision, we design a\nstructured six-dimensional annotation protocol capturing core illumination\nattributes. Building upon this, we propose LumosBench, a disentangled\nattribute-level benchmark that evaluates lighting controllability via large\nvision-language models, enabling automatic and interpretable assessment of\nrelighting precision across individual dimensions.

However, their large computational, memory, and energy demands are a\nchallenge for edge inference on FPGAs -- a field that has seen a recent surge\nin demand. We recognize the benefits of recent works on logic and Look Up Table\n(LUT) based networks, such as LogicNets, NeuraLUT, DWN, among others, in\noffering models that simultaneously reduce both the memory and compute\nfootprints. However, these models natively do not perform well on common vision\ntasks, such as CIFAR-10/100. In this work, we propose LL-ViT, a novel edge\noptimized vision transformer design that integrates layers of LUT neurons\nwithin the transformer architecture. Based on our characterization that reveals\nthat a majority of model weights and computations are from the channel mixer\n(MLP layer), we design an alternate LUT-based channel mixer, and simultaneously\ndevelop an FPGA-based accelerator for LL-ViT. Contrary to some attempts to\nreplace each multiplication with a table lookup, our architecture utilizes a\nneural learning approach which natively learns the LUT functions. This approach\nallows for reduced model sizes, and a computational and energy-efficient\ninference solution for vision transformer models. Evaluating on edge-suitable\nworkloads, we achieve accuracies of 95.5% on CIFAR-10, 78.8% on CIFAR-100, and\n60.9% on Tiny-ImageNet datasets, comparable to the baseline transformer. LL-ViT\neliminates over 60% of the model weights and 50% of the multiplications in the\nmodel, and achieves 1.9x energy efficiency and 1.3x lower latency over an\ninteger quantized ViT accelerator, while also offering superior throughput\nagainst prior works at a 10.9W power budget."}

But,\nunfortunately, they are not always easily accessible in clinical settings.\nAdditionally, many practitioners often face various structural obstacles like\nlimited data availability, fragmented data systems, and unbalanced datasets.\nThese barriers often lead to the increased diagnostic uncertainty,\nunderrepresentation of certain conditions, reduced model robustness, and biased\ndiagnostic decisions. In response to these challenges, approaches such as\ntransfer learning, meta-learning, and multimodal fusion have made great\nstrides. However, they still need a solid theoretical justification for why\nthey succeed or fail in situations where data is scarce. To address this gap,\nwe propose a unified theoretical framework that characterizes learning and\ninference under low-resource medical imaging conditions. We first formalize the\nlearning objective under few-shot conditions and compute sample complexity\nconstraints to estimate the smallest quantity of data needed to achieve\nclinically reliable accuracy.

In this paper, we tailor one Parallel Decoupling Framework (PDF)\nfor multimodal embedding learning, by utilizing the proprietary steerability of\nMLLMs, i.e., their ability to flexibly generate quite differentiated response\nunder explicit instructions. Concretely, PDF conditions a shared MLLM backbone\non distinct, learnable prefixes to roll out multiple parallel paths for one\ninput, then relies on these paths to obtain parallel embeddings. To promote\nfull parallel diversity, we employ Mutual Information Minimization (MIM) as an\nexplicit constraint, coupled with per-path contrastive supervision to maintain\nsemantic alignment. Such dual-objectives force PDF to yield robust semantic\ncoverage and a generalizable embedding space.
