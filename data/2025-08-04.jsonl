Unlike frame-based\ncameras, it records intensity changes with extremely high temporal resolution,\ncapturing sufficient structure information. Currently, existing event-based\nmethods feed a frame and events directly into a single model without fully\nexploiting modality-specific advantages, which limits their performance.\nTherefore, by analyzing the role of each sensing modality, the enhancement\npipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration and structure\nrefinement. In the first stage, we design a visibility restoration network with\namplitude-phase entanglement by rethinking the relationship between amplitude\nand phase components in Fourier space. In the second stage, a fusion strategy\nwith dynamic alignment is proposed to mitigate the spatial mismatch caused by\nthe temporal resolution discrepancy between two sensing modalities, aiming to\nrefine the structure information of the image enhanced by the visibility\nrestoration network.

However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by\nextreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth\ndiscontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous\nmotion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and\nfail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion\nfields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We\nobserve that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion\nsub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion\npatterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in\ntwo-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first\ndevise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier\nprobability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion\nfield into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.\nNext, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each\nsub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a\ncustomized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous\nmotion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational\nentanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification.

In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the\nsemantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded\nspatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful\ninformation can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators\nderived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or\nfrequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the\nfirst framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to\ngenerate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes\nthe generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We\nmeticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing\nspatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts\n(VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between\nthe audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop\nan efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional\nguidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video\ngeneration in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nSpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment\nto the input audios."}
