We emphasize that runtime-based analyses (i.e., simulation)\nare the only reliable way to ensure deadlock-free FIFO optimization for\ndata-dependent designs.\n  We present FIFOAdvisor, a framework that automatically determines FIFO sizes\nin HLS designs. It leverages LightningSim, a 99.9\\% cycle-accurate simulator\nsupporting millisecond-scale incremental runs with new FIFO configurations.\nFIFO sizing is formulated as a dual-objective black-box optimization problem,\nand we explore heuristic and search-based methods to characterize the\nlatency-resource trade-off.

However, there are some barriers that\nprevent the exploitation of the full potential of this technology. First, the\nmajor cloud providers currently put the onus of implementing the mechanisms\nthat ensure compliance with the desired service levels on cloud consumers.\nHowever, consumers do not have the required expertise. Since each cloud\nprovider exports a different set of low-level metrics, the strategies defined\nto ensure compliance with the established service-level agreement (SLA) are\nbound to a particular cloud provider. This fosters provider lock-in and\nprevents consumers from benefiting from the advantages of multi-cloud\nenvironments. This paper presents a solution to the problem of automatically\ntranslating SLAs into objectives expressed as metrics that can be measured\nacross multiple cloud providers. First, we propose an intelligent\nknowledge-based system capable of automatically translating high-level SLAs\ndefined by cloud consumers into a set of conditions expressed as vendor-neutral\nmetrics, providing feedback to cloud consumers (intelligent tutoring system).\nSecondly, we present the set of vendor-neutral metrics and explain how they can\nbe measured for the different cloud providers.

The\nframework encompasses a broad range of objects (key-value stores, counters,\nsets, CRDTs, and transactional databases) and consistency models (from causal\nconsistency and sequential consistency to snapshot isolation and transactional\nand non-transactional SQL).\n  Within this framework, we prove the \\emph{Arbitration-Free Consistency} (AFC)\ntheorem, showing that an object specification within a consistency model admits\nan available implementation if and only if it is \\emph{arbitration-free}, that\nis, it does not require a total arbitration order to resolve visibility or read\ndependencies.\n  The AFC theorem unifies and generalizes previous results, revealing\narbitration-freedom as the fundamental property that delineates\ncoordination-free consistency from inherently synchronized behavior."}

Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to\npreserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a\nresidual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware\nrepresentations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally\nrich feature maps.

However, SFT,\nbeing an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with\noverfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel\nfine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance\ngeneralization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and\nproximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from\ndemonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy\nratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves\nas an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the\nSFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without\nrelying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding\nmechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,\ndata efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of\nnatural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO\nconsistently outperforms traditional SFT methods.

This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to\ncompute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively\nguiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.\nExperiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination\nbenchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and\nrobustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL\n3B.

We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,\ndemonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse\nattention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention\nbaseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn\nachieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\\times$ in long-context\nprefilling, confirming its practical viability.

However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key\nchallenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are\nhighly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate\nstatistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained\nby the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time\nstatistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit\nthe effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under\nsignificant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on\nthe concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of\nnormalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core\nparameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the\npre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting\nduring online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate\nthat our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain\nshift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to\nforgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly\nintegrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent\nperformance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate\nthe effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain\nadaptation scenarios. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/hyeongyu-kim/Buffer_TTA."}

Recent studies have shown the\nefficacy of using deep learning to directly predict the input function,\nsurpassing established methods such as the image-derived input function (IDIF).\nIn this work, we trained a physics-informed deep learning-based input function\nprediction model (PIDLIF) to estimate the AIF directly from the PET images,\nincorporating a kinetic modeling loss during training. The proposed method uses\na two-tissue compartment model over two regions, the myocardium and brain of\nthe mice, and is trained on a dataset of 70 [${}^{18}$F]FDG dPET images of mice\naccompanied by the measured AIF during imaging. The proposed method had\ncomparable performance to the network without a physics-informed loss, and when\nsudden movement causing blurring in the images was simulated, the PIDLIF model\nmaintained high performance in severe cases of image degradation. The proposed\nphysics-informed method exhibits an improved robustness that is promoted by\nphysically constraining the problem, enforcing consistency for\nout-of-distribution samples. In conclusion, the PIDLIF model offers insight\ninto the effects of leveraging physiological distribution mechanics in mice to\nguide a deep learning-based AIF prediction network in images with severe\ndegradation as a result of blurring due to movement during imaging."}

Such divergent approaches\nresult in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align\nwith prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial\nexclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign\narchitectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,\na modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our\nkey insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the\ndata distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has\none nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can\nco-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific\nrules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever\nfactor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary\nobjectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic\nimage, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et\nal. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its\ncorresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting\nthe mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even\nboth, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and\nobject disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global\nstyle and objects.
