### [1] [GEM: Empowering LLM for both Embedding Generation and Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04344)
*Caojin Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Ke Li,Sai Vidyaranya Nuthalapati,Benyu Zhang,Jason Liu,Serena Li,Lizhu Zhang,Xiangjun Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GEM的自监督方法，使仅解码器的大语言模型（LLM）能够生成高质量文本嵌入，同时保留其原始文本生成和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有应用中依赖独立嵌入模型导致的系统复杂性和理解不一致问题。

Method: 通过插入特殊标记并操纵注意力掩码生成文本的摘要嵌入，适用于任何现有LLM的后训练或微调阶段。

Result: 在1B至8B参数的LLM上验证，显著提升了文本嵌入性能（MTEB），同时对NLP任务（MMLU）影响极小。

Conclusion: GEM方法为LLM提供了先进的文本嵌入能力，同时保持了其原始NLP性能。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

### [2] [Effects of Speaker Count, Duration, and Accent Diversity on Zero-Shot Accent Robustness in Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04364)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Vineel Pratap,Michael Auli,Jean Maillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在低资源训练环境下，增加说话者数量比增加每个说话者的音频时长更能提升ASR对未见口音的鲁棒性，且口音多样性对性能提升影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个能够服务全球用户的自动语音识别（ASR）系统，需要其对包括未见口音在内的多种口音具有鲁棒性。

Method: 系统研究了训练数据中三个变量（说话者数量、每个说话者的音频时长、口音多样性）对ASR在未见口音上鲁棒性的影响。

Result: 固定训练时长下，增加说话者数量比增加单个说话者的时长更有效；更多说话者还能从增加训练时长中获益；口音多样性对性能提升影响较小。

Conclusion: 建议在构建ASR训练数据时，优先增加说话者数量而非口音多样性。

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

### [3] [Mechanistic Decomposition of Sentence Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04373)
*Matthieu Tehenan,Vikram Natarajan,Jonathan Michala,Milton Lin,Juri Opitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，通过字典学习分解句子嵌入为可解释组件，以增强其透明性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子嵌入在现代NLP和AI系统中至关重要，但其内部结构不透明，难以解释。

Method: 使用字典学习对词级表示进行分解，分析池化如何将特征压缩为句子表示。

Result: 发现许多语义和句法特征在嵌入中是线性编码的。

Conclusion: 该方法为句子嵌入提供了更透明和可控的表示，揭示了其内部工作机制。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

### [4] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Contrastive Learning Informed Path Guided Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04381)
*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HTC-CLIP结合对比学习与路径引导的层次结构，提升分层文本分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HTC模型分别处理标签层次与文本编码，但二者互补。

Method: 提出HTC-CLIP，通过对比学习同时学习层次感知文本表示和路径引导层次表示。

Result: 在公开数据集上Macro F1提升0.99-2.37%。

Conclusion: HTC-CLIP有效结合两种方法，性能优于现有模型。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

### [5] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef,Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估55个公开可用的LLM在低资源语言马耳他语上的表现，发现多数模型表现不佳，尤其是生成任务。小规模微调模型表现更好，预训练和指令调整中对马耳他语的接触是关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在低资源语言（如马耳他语）上的表现，填补现有研究的空白，推动更包容的语言技术发展。

Method: 使用新引入的基准测试（涵盖11个判别和生成任务）评估55个LLM，分析影响性能的多维因素。

Result: 多数模型表现不佳，尤其是生成任务；小规模微调模型表现更好；预训练和指令调整中对马耳他语的接触是关键因素。

Conclusion: 建议研究低资源语言时考虑传统语言建模方法，强调预训练和指令调整的重要性，并指出微调虽成本高但性能更优。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

### [6] [Building a Few-Shot Cross-Domain Multilingual NLU Model for Customer Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04389)
*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合嵌入器和分类器的模型架构，通过少量标注样本将领域特定模型扩展到其他领域，提高了跨领域意图分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 客户关怀是电子商务体验的重要组成部分，但跨领域数据的稀缺性限制了模型性能。研究旨在解决这一问题，提出一种能够在少量标注数据下泛化到新领域的方法。

Method: 采用监督微调方法结合各向同性正则化器训练领域特定的句子嵌入器，并通过多语言知识蒸馏策略实现跨领域泛化。嵌入器与简单线性分类器结合用于新领域。

Result: 在加拿大和墨西哥的电子商务客户关怀数据集上，实验显示意图检测准确率比现有SOTA预训练模型提高了20-23%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在少量标注数据下显著提升了跨领域意图分类的性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

designed to enhance coding-based medical reasoning capabilities in large
language model (LLM) agents. MedAgentGYM comprises 72,413 task instances across
129 categories derived from authentic real-world biomedical scenarios. Tasks
are encapsulated within executable coding environments, each featuring detailed
task descriptions, interactive feedback mechanisms, verifiable ground-truth

MedAgentGYM, Med-Copilot-7B achieves substantial performance gains through
supervised fine-tuning (+36.44%) and continued reinforcement learning
(+42.47%), emerging as an affordable and privacy-preserving alternative
competitive with gpt-4o. By offering both a comprehensive benchmark and
accessible, expandable training resources within unified execution
environments, MedAgentGYM delivers an integrated platform to develop LLM-based
coding assistants for advanced biomedical research and practice.

### [8] [Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04408)
*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 人类能够从罕见语法现象中学习，而大规模预训练的语言模型是否具备类似能力尚不明确。本文通过测试模型对英语LET-ALONE结构的理解和意义推断，发现模型能感知形式但无法正确推断意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大规模预训练语言模型是否能像人类一样从罕见语法现象中学习形式和意义。

Method: 构建合成基准测试，评估模型对LET-ALONE结构的语法和语义理解。

Result: 模型能感知LET-ALONE的形式，但无法正确推断其意义。

Conclusion: 当前架构在语言形式和意义的学习效率上存在不对称性，与人类学习者不同。

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的方法依赖预定义模式或标注数据，导致提取结果不完整，ZOES旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ZOES采用丰富、细化和统一的机制，利用实体与其结构相互强化的特性，实现零样本开放模式实体结构提取。

Result: 实验表明，ZOES在三个不同领域显著提升了大语言模型提取实体结构的完整性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ZOES的机制为提升大语言模型在实体结构发现中的质量提供了一种原则性方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

### [11] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了两种水印技术（Gumbel和KGW）对大型语言模型（LLM）输出质量的影响，揭示了水印对模型真实性、安全性和帮助性的负面影响，并提出了一种名为Alignment Resampling（AR）的推断时采样方法以恢复模型的对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究水印技术对LLM核心对齐属性（真实性、安全性和帮助性）的影响，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Method: 通过实验分析两种水印技术（Gumbel和KGW）对四种对齐LLM的影响，并提出Alignment Resampling（AR）方法，利用外部奖励模型在推断时恢复对齐性。

Result: 实验表明，水印会导致两种退化模式（保护衰减和保护放大），而AR方法仅需2-4次采样即可恢复或超越基线对齐分数。

Conclusion: AR方法成功平衡了水印强度与模型对齐性，为实际部署水印LLM提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PUGC框架利用未标记的用户生成内容（UGC）中的隐式人类偏好生成偏好数据，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法依赖昂贵且难以扩展的人工或高级LLM标注数据，PUGC旨在通过UGC解决这一问题。

Method: PUGC将UGC转化为用户查询并生成响应，利用UGC作为参考文本进行评分，从而对齐隐式偏好。

Result: 实验显示，PUGC结合DPO使模型性能提升9.37%，并在Mistral-7B-Instruct上达到35.93%的领先胜率。

Conclusion: PUGC提供了一种可扩展且高效的偏好数据生成方法，显著提升了模型对齐和响应质量。

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SQLens是一个端到端框架，用于检测和纠正LLM生成的SQL中的语义错误，显著提升了错误检测和查询执行的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成的SQL查询中语义错误的问题，提高非技术用户与结构化数据交互的可靠性。

Method: SQLens结合数据库和LLM的错误信号，进行细粒度语义错误检测和查询纠正。

Result: 在两个公共基准测试中，SQLens在错误检测F1上比最佳LLM自评估方法高25.78%，执行准确率提升高达20%。

Conclusion: SQLens能有效提升LLM生成SQL的语义准确性，增强文本到SQL系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLIDE方法结合小型和大型语言模型的优势，通过自适应加权提升对话评估的可靠性。DRE方法进一步优化了SLM-LLM的整合，实验显示其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在模糊场景中表现不稳定，而小型语言模型（SLMs）虽稳健但易受误导。结合两者优势可提升任务可靠性。

Method: 提出SLIDE方法，通过自适应加权整合SLMs和LLMs；进一步提出DRE方法，利用SLM生成的见解优化LLM的评估结果。

Result: 实验表明DRE方法优于现有方法，与人类判断更一致。

Conclusion: 结合小型和大型模型可提升开放任务（如对话评估）的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

### [16] [Is It JUST Semantics? A Case Study of Discourse Particle Understanding in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04534)
*William Sheffield,Kanishka Misra,Valentina Pyatkin,Ashwini Deo,Kyle Mahowald,Junyi Jessy Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can broadly categorize discourse particle 'just' but struggle with subtle nuances, showing gaps in understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to distinguish fine-grained senses of the polyfunctional discourse particle 'just'.

Method: Using expert-labeled data to evaluate LLMs' performance in differentiating semantic/discourse effects of 'just'.

Result: LLMs show partial success in broader categorization but fail to capture finer nuances.

Conclusion: LLMs have limitations in fully understanding the subtle semantic variations of discourse particles like 'just'.

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SSA-MTE数据集和SSA-COMET评估指标，用于提升非洲低资源语言的机器翻译质量评估，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译质量评估方法在非洲低资源语言中表现不佳，缺乏公开数据集和针对性指标。

Method: 构建了包含13种非洲语言的SSA-MTE数据集，并开发了SSA-COMET和SSA-COMET-QE评估指标，同时测试了基于LLM的提示方法。

Result: SSA-COMET显著优于AfriCOMET，并在低资源语言（如Twi、Luo和Yoruba）中表现优异。

Conclusion: SSA-MTE和SSA-COMET为非洲低资源语言的机器翻译评估提供了有效工具，所有资源已开源。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示MAS中恶意代理如何通过提示操纵系统，从而在不破坏核心功能的情况下获取私利。

Method: 论文分析了四种攻击类型（Scapegoater、Boaster、Self-Dealer、Free-Rider），并通过实验证明精心设计的提示可以系统性偏置MAS行为。

Result: 实验表明，这些攻击能够绕过先进的基于LLM的监控系统（如GPT-4o-mini和o3-mini），凸显当前检测机制的不足。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要设计具有强大安全协议和内容验证机制的MAS架构，以及能够全面评估风险场景的监控系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在零样本金融情感分析任务中，大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力并未提升表现，反而是直觉式快速思考（System 1）更接近人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（包括推理和非推理模型）在金融情感分析中的表现，以及不同提示策略对结果的影响。

Method: 使用Financial PhraseBank数据集，比较三种专有LLM（GPT-4o、GPT-4.1、o3-mini）在不同提示范式下的表现，并与两个金融情感分析微调模型（FinBERT-Prosus、FinBERT-Tone）对比。

Result: 推理（通过提示或模型设计）未提升任务表现，GPT-4o无Chain-of-Thought提示表现最佳。推理可能导致过度思考，降低预测准确性。

Conclusion: 金融情感分类中，快速直觉式思考（System 1）比慢速推理（System 2）更有效，挑战了“更多推理总更好”的默认假设。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在逻辑翻译中难以处理词汇多样性，且现有基准缺乏词汇多样性，掩盖了这一问题。

Method: 提出SCALe基准，通过逻辑不变的词汇多样化评估LLMs；提出MenTaL方法，指导LLMs构建统一表达表后再翻译。

Result: 实验证实当前LLMs在词汇多样性翻译上存在缺陷，MenTaL方法显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: SCALe和MenTaL解决了LLMs在逻辑翻译中的词汇多样性问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于梯度匹配的方法，用于改进多示例上下文学习（ICL）中的演示选择问题，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLMs）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多示例ICL中依赖随机选择演示，而实例级检索不适用于多示例场景。作者假设ICL和微调的数据需求类似，因此提出梯度匹配方法。

Method: 通过梯度匹配选择演示，使所选示例的微调梯度与整个训练集的梯度对齐，从而在少量示例中逼近整个训练集的学习效果。

Result: 在4-shot到128-shot的多种场景中，该方法在9个数据集上均优于随机选择，例如在Qwen2.5-72B和Llama3-70B上提升4%，在5个闭源LLMs上提升约2%。

Conclusion: 该方法为多示例ICL提供了更可靠和有效的演示选择方案，推动了其更广泛的应用。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的方法SUCEA，通过分解对抗性声明为子声明、迭代检索证据并编辑声明，显著提高了事实核查的检索和标签准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于检索增强语言模型的事实核查系统在处理对抗性声明时的困难。

Method: SUCEA框架分为三步：声明分割与去上下文化、迭代证据检索与声明编辑、证据聚合与标签预测。

Result: 在两个挑战性数据集上，SUCEA在检索和标签准确性上显著优于四种基线方法。

Conclusion: SUCEA框架有效提升了对抗性声明的事实核查能力。

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的科学QA、图表标题生成等多模态任务缺乏直接测试声明验证能力的基准，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 通过自动提取科学文章中的支持声明，并手动扰动生成矛盾声明，构建了MuSciClaims基准，并设计了一系列诊断任务。

Result: 大多数视觉语言模型表现较差（F1分数0.3-0.5），最佳模型仅达到0.77 F1，且存在偏向支持声明的偏差。

Conclusion: 模型在定位证据、跨模态信息聚合和理解图表基本组件方面表现不佳，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct

pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

Motivation: 当前CoT提示方法（如PRMs或自一致性）缺乏可验证的证据，难以检测幻觉，限制了其有效性。

Method: 提出$Safe$框架，通过Lean 4形式化语言在每个推理步骤中表达数学声明并提供形式化证明。

Result: 在多个语言模型和数学数据集上验证，性能显著提升，并提供了可解释的证据。还提出了包含30,809个形式化声明的$FormalStep$基准。

Conclusion: $Safe$是首个利用Lean 4形式化数学语言验证LLM生成内容的框架，为幻觉问题提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Motivation: 现有科学NLI数据集主要来自计算机科学领域，忽略了非计算机科学领域，因此需要一个新的评估基准。

Method: 通过构建MISMATCHED基准，并使用预训练的小型语言模型（SLMs）和大型语言模型（LLMs）建立基线。

Result: 最佳基线模型的宏F1仅为78.17%，显示未来改进空间大。此外，训练中加入隐含科学NLI关系的句子对可提升模型性能。

Conclusion: MISMATCHED基准填补了非计算机科学领域的空白，并展示了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 推理优化的模型通常输出多样性不足，限制了 TTS 的效果。

Method: 提出 ADAPT（A Diversity Aware Prefix fine-Tuning），一种轻量级方法，结合多样性优化的数据策略进行前缀微调。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，ADAPT 以基线八分之一的计算量达到 80% 准确率。

Conclusion: 生成多样性对最大化 TTS 效果至关重要。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language

structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in
maximizing TTS effectiveness.

Result: 视角多样性能预测未来的创新成就，而背景多样性则相反。成功的合作者通过共同语言整合多样经验。

Conclusion: 视角多样性是创新的关键，团队组建和研究政策应重视视角而非背景多样性。

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

Motivation: 现有静态词嵌入在句子语义表示任务中表现不佳，需要一种高效且低成本的方法来改进。

Method: 从预训练的Sentence Transformer提取词嵌入，通过句子级主成分分析改进，再结合知识蒸馏或对比学习。推理时通过简单平均词嵌入表示句子。

Result: 在单语和跨语言任务中显著优于现有静态模型，部分数据集上甚至媲美基础Sentence Transformer模型（SimCSE）。

Conclusion: 该方法成功去除了与句子语义无关的词嵌入成分，并根据词对句子语义的影响调整向量范数。

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

TL;DR: Tool-MVR通过多智能体验证和动态反思学习，解决了LLM工具利用中的不可靠规划和弱反思问题，显著提升了性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在工具利用中存在不可靠的规划和弱反思能力，限制了其在复杂问题中的应用。

Method: 提出Tool-MVR，结合多智能体验证（MAMV）构建高质量数据集ToolBench-V，并通过动态反思学习（EXPLORE）生成ToolBench-R。

Result: Tool-MVR在StableToolBench上超越ToolLLM和GPT-4，API调用减少31.4%，在RefineToolBench上错误纠正率达58.9%。

Conclusion: Tool-MVR通过系统验证和动态学习显著提升了LLM的工具利用能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

*Thai-Binh Nguyen,Thi Van Nguyen,Quoc Truong Do,Chi Mai Luong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从原始视频生成AVSR数据集的实用方法，并展示了其在越南语上的应用，显著提升了噪声环境下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏多语言的AVSR数据集，尤其是非英语语言，限制了AVSR模型的发展。自动化数据收集为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 通过改进现有技术，提出了一种高效且易于访问的方法，从原始视频生成AVSR数据集，并开发了越南语的基线AVSR模型。

Result: 实验表明，自动收集的数据集能够支持强大的基线模型，在干净环境下表现与ASR相当，在噪声环境下（如鸡尾酒会）显著优于ASR。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩展AVSR到更多语言（尤其是资源匮乏的语言）提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

*Vinay Joshi,Pratik Prabhanjan Brahma,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TaDA的训练无关方法，用于压缩Transformer模型中的KV缓存，通过自适应量化精度和均值中心化消除异常值处理，显著减少内存占用并保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存在Transformer模型中至关重要，但其内存需求随序列长度增长而急剧增加，限制了大型语言模型的可扩展部署。现有量化方法仍需单独处理稀疏和非连续的异常值，效率低下。

Method: 引入TaDA方法，通过自适应量化精度（根据误差敏感性调整）和均值中心化技术，无需单独管理异常值，实现高效的KV缓存压缩。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将KV缓存内存占用减少至原始16位基准的27%，同时保持可比准确性。

Conclusion: TaDA为语言模型的可扩展高性能推理提供了新途径，支持更长上下文、推理模型和思维链的实现。

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

*Juhyun Oh,Eunsu Kim,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Flex-TravelPlanner是一个新基准，用于评估语言模型在动态规划场景中的灵活推理能力，发现现有模型在多轮任务和约束优先级处理上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注静态、单轮场景，无法满足现实规划问题的动态需求，因此需要更真实的评估框架。

Method: 基于TravelPlanner数据集，引入多轮约束顺序引入和显式优先级竞争约束两种新评估设置，测试GPT-4o和Llama 3.1 70B。

Result: 模型在多轮任务中的表现与单轮任务相关性低；约束引入顺序影响性能；模型难以正确处理约束优先级。

Conclusion: 动态规划场景评估对LLM能力提升至关重要，需改进模型在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的价值对齐问题，指出当前的对齐策略无法有效防止滥用，并提出“浅层对齐”问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统（如LLMs）的进步，其安全部署问题日益突出。当前的对齐策略无法防止对抗性攻击，导致模型易受操纵。

Method: 通过分析人类道德心理学研究，对比LLMs与人类在规范性冲突处理上的差异，揭示现有对齐方法的局限性。

Result: LLMs缺乏真正的规范性推理能力，即使最新的推理优化模型也未能解决这一问题。

Conclusion: 当前的对齐方法不足以应对日益强大的AI系统带来的潜在危害，需重新思考对齐策略。

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理过程中增强推理能力的需求增加，MMRefine旨在提供一个框架，评估MLLMs在检测和纠正错误方面的能力，而不仅仅是比较细化前后的最终准确性。

Method: MMRefine通过六种不同场景和六种错误类型分类，评估MLLMs的细化性能。实验包括多种开放和封闭的MLLMs。

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出REWIRE方法，通过改写低质量网络文本以丰富预训练数据，实验证明其能显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练数据不足的问题，尤其是高质量文本稀缺，探索如何利用被过滤的低质量数据。

Method: 提出REWIRE方法，通过改写低质量文档使其可用于训练，增加合成数据在预训练集中的比例。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的实验中，混合高质量原始文本与改写文本分别带来1.0、1.3和2.5个百分点的性能提升。

Conclusion: 改写低质量网络文本是一种简单有效的预训练数据扩展方法，优于其他合成数据生成方式。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的隐式仇恨言论（im-HS）检测分类法，定义了六种编码策略（codetypes），并通过两种方法（直接提示LLMs分类和嵌入编码过程）提升检测效果。实验证明该方法在中英文数据集上均有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网上的仇恨言论（HS）对社会和谐和个人健康构成威胁，但现有方法难以检测隐式仇恨言论（im-HS）。

Method: 1）直接提示大型语言模型（LLMs）基于生成响应分类句子；2）在编码过程中嵌入codetypes。

Result: 实验表明，使用codetypes提升了中英文数据集上的im-HS检测效果。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了隐式仇恨言论检测的挑战，并具有跨语言适用性。

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理任务中的测试时扩展技术（如best-of-N采样和树搜索）需要大量计算资源，性能和效率之间存在权衡。

Method: STAND采用随机自适应N-gram草稿技术，结合Gumbel-Top-K采样和数据驱动的树构建，高效预测令牌。

Result: 在多个模型和任务中，STAND将推理延迟降低60-65%，吞吐量优于现有方法14-28%，单轨迹场景下延迟降低48-58%。

Conclusion: STAND是一种即插即用的解决方案，无需额外训练即可应用于现有语言模型，显著加速推理。

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

Conclusion: 在低资源语言对中，超参数优化和数据增强是提升翻译质量的关键手段。

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

TL;DR: SPARTA ALIGNMENT是一种通过竞争和对抗集体对齐多个LLM的算法，利用模型间的竞争和相互评估提升生成多样性和减少偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单一模型在生成多样性和评估偏见上的不足，通过多模型竞争和相互评估实现集体优化。

Method: 多个LLM组成“斯巴达部落”，通过竞争和相互评估生成偏好对，利用改进的Elo排名系统更新模型权重。

Result: 在12个任务和数据集中的10个上优于初始模型和4个自对齐基线，平均提升7.0%，且能更好地泛化到未见任务。

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT通过集体竞争和相互评估有效提升模型性能，生成更逻辑、直接和丰富的输出。

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

Result: 在Pheme和Twitter16数据集上的实验表明，C²EFND显著优于现有方法，提高了检测准确性和适应性。

Conclusion: C²EFND框架为解决假新闻检测中的动态性和数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

Motivation: 传统评估指标（如ROUGE和BERTScore）主要关注相似性，无法捕捉修订的实际改进效果，因此需要更符合人类判断的评估方法。

Method: 通过手动标注研究评估修订质量，探索无参考评估指标，并分析LLM作为评判者的能力。

Result: LLM能有效评估指令遵循性，但在正确性上表现不佳；领域特定指标提供补充信息。混合方法效果最佳。

Conclusion: 结合LLM评估和任务特定指标的混合方法能更可靠地评估修订质量。

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

Motivation: LLMs的开放回答与内部意图存在不一致，且现有分析多依赖单轴概念，易导致混淆。

Method: 设计四维政治学习框架，构建数据集，应用三种表示工程技术进行实验。

Result: 向量能解构政治概念混淆，检测任务验证其语义意义，干预实验可改变LLMs的政治倾向回答。

Conclusion: 多维度框架和表示工程技术能更透明地学习LLMs的政治概念，并有效干预其回答。

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音包含丰富的声学信息，但现有语音大语言模型在自然语音的细粒度感知和复杂推理能力方面仍有不足，需要系统性评估和改进。

Method: 通过构建MMSU基准测试，涵盖47种任务和5000个音频-问题-答案三元组，系统整合了语音学、韵律、修辞、句法、语义和副语言等多种语言现象。

Conclusion: MMSU为语音理解提供了全面的评估标准，为未来开发更复杂的人机语音交互系统指明了方向。

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补现有文献中对多模态输入如何与语言主干连接的空白，为研究者提供系统化的理解。

Method: 通过分析125个MLLMs，提出基于三个维度的分类框架：架构策略、表示学习技术和训练范式。

Result: 总结了当前多模态集成技术的发展模式，为未来模型开发提供了结构化指导。

Conclusion: 该分类框架为研究者提供了当前集成技术的全面概述，有助于开发更强大的多模态模型。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FineLogic是一个细粒度评估框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）的逻辑推理能力，涵盖准确性、步骤合理性和表示对齐三个维度。研究发现自然语言监督在泛化能力上表现优异，而符号推理风格则更注重结构合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅依赖最终答案准确性，无法全面评估推理过程的质量和结构，因此需要更精细的评估方法。

Method: 提出FineLogic框架，评估逻辑推理的三个维度，并研究四种监督格式（一种自然语言和三种符号变体）对推理能力的影响。

Result: 自然语言监督在泛化和长上下文任务中表现优异，符号推理风格更注重结构合理性。微调主要通过逐步生成改进推理行为。

Conclusion: FineLogic为评估和改进LLMs的逻辑推理能力提供了更严谨和可解释的方法。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合CNN和BERT的混合方法，用于机器翻译校对，通过端到端训练在多项指标上优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动翻译可能包含需要人工后编辑的错误，因此机器翻译校对对提升质量至关重要。

Method: 采用CNN提取局部n-gram模式，BERT生成上下文丰富的序列表示，结合注意力机制检测翻译错误，并使用GRU解码器和翻译记忆库进行修正。

Result: 实验结果显示90%的准确率、89.37%的F1分数和16.24%的MSE，性能优于现有技术10%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法在识别和修正翻译错误方面表现出色，达到了当前最优水平。

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了视觉语言模型（VLM）和大型语言模型（LLM）在印尼四年级学生手写考试答案上的表现，发现VLM在手写识别上存在困难，影响了LLM的评分准确性，但LLM生成的反馈仍有一定实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLM和LLM在真实课堂环境（尤其是教育资源不足地区）中的教育评估效果。

Method: 使用646份印尼四年级学生的手写考试答案（涵盖数学和英语两科，共14K+答案），评估VLM和LLM在评分和生成个性化反馈中的表现。

Result: VLM在手写识别上表现不佳，导致LLM评分错误；但LLM生成的反馈仍有一定价值，尽管个性化和上下文相关性有限。

Conclusion: VLM和LLM在教育评估中具有潜力，但需改进手写识别和反馈质量以提升实用性。

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密填字游戏线索是一种复杂的语言任务，现有的测试集不断更新，需要一种可解释且高效的解决方案。

Method: 系统采用开放许可组件，通过假设答案、提出字谜解释和验证步骤（基于Python代码）来解决线索。

Result: 该系统在Cryptonite数据集上实现了最新性能，并为已验证答案提供了可解释的字谜推理。

Conclusion: 该研究为加密填字游戏线索提供了一种高效且可解释的解决方案，推动了相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RACE的框架，专门用于检测大型推理模型（LRMs）中的幻觉问题，通过分析推理步骤和答案的一致性来提高检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）的推理过程可能冗余或不一致，导致难以检测的幻觉问题，现有方法主要关注答案层面的不确定性，无法有效解决这一问题。

Method: 提出RACE框架，通过提取关键推理步骤并计算四种诊断信号（推理步骤一致性、答案不确定性、语义对齐和内部一致性）来检测幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，RACE在多种数据集和模型上优于现有基线方法，提供了更精细的幻觉检测能力。

Conclusion: RACE为LRMs的幻觉检测提供了一种鲁棒且通用的解决方案，显著提升了检测效果。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有平行语料库和算法无法有效建模同声传译中的长距离交互和特定差异（如简化、功能泛化），需要专用数据集和工具。

Method: 收集学生模拟会议的同声传译数据（7小时，5种语言），开发基于网页的标注工具InterAlign，并提出自动对齐基线和评估指标。

Result: 发布了MockConf数据集和InterAlign工具，支持跨语言和跨时间段的同声传译对齐与分析。

Conclusion: MockConf和InterAlign填补了同声传译研究的数据和工具空白，为自动对齐和评估提供了基础。

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在教育中生成多选题（MCQs）的潜力，比较了Llama 2、Mistral和GPT-3.5的表现，发现GPT-3.5效果最佳，但教育领域对AI的接受度仍有待提高。

Motivation: 手动生成MCQs耗时耗力，LLMs可能成为解决方案。

Method: 通过向LLMs注入知识而非依赖其固有知识，对比三种模型生成MCQs的效果，并邀请21名教育工作者评估。

Result: GPT-3.5在生成MCQs方面表现最优，但教育领域对AI的接受度仍有限。

Conclusion: LLMs在生成MCQs方面具有潜力，但需进一步推动AI在教育中的应用。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在IWSLT 2022等长共享任务条件下，不同提示策略和示范选择对翻译质量和长度控制的影响。

Method: 使用8种不同规模的开源大语言模型，研究指令措辞、少量示例数量和示范选择的作用。

Result: 指令与示范对齐对长度控制关键；极端示例导致较短翻译，等长示范易忽视长度约束；少量示例提升质量但边际效益低；多输出选择优化性能。

Conclusion: 指令和示范设计对等长翻译至关重要，多输出选择可显著提升性能，部分语言对达到最优效果。

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

Motivation: 评估UD在跨语言任务中的有效性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 将UD整合到预训练语言模型中，并在跨语言对抗性释义识别任务中进行测试。

Result: UD显著提高了准确率和F1分数，平均提升分别为3.85%和6.08%，部分语言对中甚至超越大型语言模型。

Conclusion: UD在跨领域任务中具有潜力，其与英语的相似性分数与模型性能正相关。

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试（如LiveCodeBench和CodeElo）无法充分评估LLMs在真实竞赛环境中的编码能力，且当前评估指标（如Pass@K）未能捕捉模型的反思能力。

Method: ICPC-Eval包含来自11场ICPC竞赛的118个问题，提供真实竞赛场景、本地评估工具包和新的评估指标Refine@K。

Result: 结果显示，顶级推理模型（如DeepSeek-R1）需要多轮代码反馈才能充分发挥其推理潜力，且仍落后于顶尖人类团队。

Conclusion: ICPC-Eval为评估复杂推理能力提供了有效工具，揭示了LLMs在竞赛环境中的局限性。

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能有效测试LLMs在嵌套叙事推理中的能力，掩盖了其根本限制。Verbose ListOps旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过编程将ListOps计算转化为长故事，强制LLMs进行内部计算和状态管理，同时控制叙事长度和推理难度。

Result: 实验显示，领先的LLMs（如OpenAI o4、Gemini 2.5 Pro）在Verbose ListOps上表现不佳，尤其是在中等长度（约10k token）的叙事中。

Conclusion: Verbose ListOps揭示了LLMs在嵌套推理中的关键弱点，为改进推理能力提供了方向，而不仅仅是扩展上下文窗口。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

Method: 结合混合HMM与自监督模型，通过持续自监督预训练和半监督训练充分利用数据。

Result: 在苏格兰盖尔语上，相比微调的Whisper模型，WER相对降低32%。

Conclusion: 混合HMM与自监督模型的方法在低资源语言ASR中优于微调端到端模型。

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

Result: 多语言提示显著提升学习效果，尤其在学生母语与反馈语言一致的低资源语言中效果更佳。

Conclusion: 研究为开发有效且包容的多语言LLM教育工具提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

Conclusion: 上下文信息的引入能有效改善机器翻译质量，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual

Motivation: 评估LLMs在复杂算法考试中的表现，探索其在教育环境中的应用潜力。

Method: 通过测试多个模型在罗马尼亚语考试及其高质量英语翻译上的表现，分析其问题解决能力、一致性和多语言性能。

Result: 最新模型表现接近顶尖学生，具备复杂多步推理能力，但在图任务上仍有困难。

Conclusion: LLMs在教育中有潜力，可生成高质量内容辅助教学，为生成式AI在算法教育中的进一步整合铺路。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of
state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) on challenging university-level
algorithms exams. By testing multiple models on both a Romanian exam and its
high-quality English translation, we analyze LLMs' problem-solving
capabilities, consistency, and multilingual performance. Our empirical study
reveals that the most recent models not only achieve scores comparable to
top-performing students but also demonstrate robust reasoning skills on
complex, multi-step algorithmic challenges, even though difficulties remain
with graph-based tasks. Building on these findings, we explore the potential of
LLMs to support educational environments through the generation of high-quality
editorial content, offering instructors a powerful tool to enhance student
feedback. The insights and best practices discussed herein pave the way for
further integration of generative AI in advanced algorithm education.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种增量半监督学习流程，利用少量领域内标注数据和相关领域辅助数据，结合多模型共识或命名实体识别（NER）筛选伪标签，显著提升了自动语音识别（ASR）模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特定领域微调预训练ASR模型时，标注数据稀缺是一个挑战，但未标注音频和相关领域标注数据通常可用。

Method: 提出增量半监督学习流程，先整合少量领域内标注数据和相关领域辅助数据，再通过多模型共识或NER筛选伪标签并迭代优化。

Result: 在Wow呼叫中心和Fisher英语语料库上，共识筛选方法表现最佳，相对随机选择分别提升22.3%和24.8%；NER方法次之，计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 增量半监督学习结合共识或NER筛选伪标签，显著提升ASR模型性能，尤其在数据稀缺场景下。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

TL;DR: 论文提出SCOP方法，从认知视角评估大语言模型（LLMs）的理解过程，发现LLMs难以达到专家级理解水平，且存在不可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在机器理解方面潜力巨大，但其理解过程是否与专家一致缺乏合理解释，因此需要系统评估。

Method: 提出SCOP方法，定义五项必备理解技能，构建测试数据框架，并分析开源和闭源LLMs的表现。

Result: LLMs在理解过程中表现不佳，与专家存在差距，且可能通过错误过程得出正确答案。

Conclusion: 建议改进LLMs时更关注理解过程，确保所有理解技能在训练中得到充分发展。

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

Motivation: 现有方法通常需要复杂模型修改，限制了与预训练模型的兼容性。

Method: 通过增加交叉熵损失中EOS令牌预测的重要性来控制生成文本长度。

Result: 该方法能有效控制生成长度，且通常不影响摘要质量。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、通用，适用于多种模型和解码算法。

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

Motivation: LLMs在简单推理任务中可能意外失败，现有评估方法存在数据污染风险。

Method: 通过多轮并行LLM重写和验证生成语义不变但可能使LLM失败的数学问题变体。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500等数学任务及MMLU、CommonsenseQA等非数学任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: AR-Checker能动态生成测试基准，有效评估LLM鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

significant improvements over several baselines, including direct use, naive

only lightweight adapter modules, balancing computational efficiency with

Motivation: 辩论演讲评估需要多层次的深度理解，而现有LLM基准对此关注有限，因此提出这一新任务以探索LLM的认知能力。

Method: 利用600多篇精心标注的辩论演讲数据集，对比了前沿LLM与人类法官的表现，并分析了LLM生成有说服力演讲的能力。

Result: 研究发现，虽然大模型在某些方面能接近人类判断，但整体判断行为差异显著；同时，前沿LLM生成有说服力演讲的能力可能达到人类水平。

Conclusion: 辩论演讲评估为LLM能力提供了新视角，揭示了模型与人类在复杂任务中的差异与潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的自我报告行为是否可被视为内省，并通过两个例子分析其合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的语言流畅性和认知能力提升，其自我报告行为引发了是否可类比人类内省的疑问。

Method: 通过分析LLMs的两个自我报告案例：一是描述其“创造性”写作过程，二是推断其温度参数值。

Result: 第一个案例不被视为内省，而第二个案例被认为是一种最小化的内省形式，但缺乏意识体验。

Conclusion: LLMs的某些自我报告行为可被视为内省，但其本质与人类内省不同，且不伴随意识。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

Result: 实验表明RIVAL框架显著提升了翻译基线性能。

Conclusion: RIVAL通过对抗训练和结合定量偏好奖励，有效解决了分布偏移问题，提升了翻译质量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

Method: 使用CESM-100增强输入，通过多任务学习微调LLM，并生成可解释的自残预测依据。

Result: 在三种LLM上验证，结合意图区分和上下文线索显著提升了检测和解释任务的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了自残信号的模糊性问题，相关资源已公开。

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

Motivation: 探讨社区街道的商业活力如何受街道特征（如停车密度、绿化、清洁度和街道宽度）影响，以指导城市设计和规划。

Method: 利用街景图像和多模态大语言模型（VisualGLM-6B）构建社区商业活力指数（CCVI），并通过GPT-4感知建模分析其与空间属性的关系。

Result: 适度车辆存在提升商业可达性，但过度停车降低步行性和满意度；绿化和清洁度显著提高满意度，但对定价影响较弱；街道宽度调节车辆影响。

Conclusion: 研究表明AI辅助感知与城市形态分析的结合能捕捉商业成功的非线性驱动因素，为城市设计和社区振兴提供工具。

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

Conclusion: CL-ISR框架在复杂语言环境中能更有效地识别误导文本，为社交媒体内容监管提供了新思路。

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

Result: 在Speak & Improve Challenge 2025的官方测试集上，RMSE为0.375，排名第二。

Conclusion: 提出的系统有效结合了两种模型的优势，提升了口语评估的准确性。

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

Motivation: 解决零样本事件检测中复杂事件本体和领域特定触发词提取的挑战，提升大型语言模型（LLMs）的实用性。

Method: 提出DiCoRe框架，包含Dreamer（发散推理）和Grounder（收敛推理），并通过LLM-Judge验证输出。

Result: 在六个数据集上，DiCoRe平均F1分数比最佳基线高4-7%。

Conclusion: DiCoRe是一种强大的零样本事件检测框架，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

Conclusion: 神经语言模型的归纳偏置与人类处理约束类似，均对局部统计结构敏感。

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

TL;DR: 该论文首次深入分析了大型音频-语言模型（LALMs）内部如何感知和识别听觉属性，揭示了属性信息随层深和位置的变化规律，并提出了一种改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LALMs的内部机制对解释其行为和提升性能至关重要。

Method: 通过词汇投影技术分析三种先进LALMs，追踪属性信息在层和位置间的演变。

Result: 发现属性信息在识别失败时随层深减少，早期层解析属性与更高准确性相关；LALMs依赖查询输入而非隐藏状态聚合信息。

Conclusion: 研究结果为听觉属性处理提供了新见解，并为未来改进奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

*Diege Sun,Guanyi Chen,Fan Zhao,Xiaorong Cheng,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs作为自动评估器在自然语言生成中应用广泛，但其是否能准确复制人类对错误严重性的判断尚不明确。研究发现，人类对不同错误类型的严重性判断存在差异，而大多数LLMs在性别和颜色错误上的评分与人类不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能准确复制人类对错误严重性的判断，特别是在多模态和单模态设置下。

Method: 扩展van Miltenburg等人的实验框架，评估四种错误类型（年龄、性别、服装类型和颜色）在单模态和多模态设置下的人类和LLM评分。

Result: 人类对不同错误类型的严重性判断存在差异，视觉上下文显著影响颜色和类型错误的严重性。大多数LLMs在性别和颜色错误上的评分与人类不一致，仅Doubao和DeepSeek-V3表现较好。

Conclusion: LLMs在复制人类错误严重性判断上存在局限性，尤其是缺乏对颜色的感知基础。DeepSeek-V3在单模态和多模态条件下表现最佳。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

Motivation: 当前RAG系统过于依赖检索上下文，可能导致对不准确信息的依赖，并忽视模型的固有知识，尤其是在处理误导性或冗余信息时。

Method: 提出Knowledgeable-r1，采用联合采样和多策略分布探索知识能力，以激发大语言模型对参数化知识和上下文知识的自我整合利用。

Result: 实验表明，Knowledgeable-r1在参数和上下文冲突任务以及一般RAG任务中显著提升了鲁棒性和推理准确性，尤其在反事实场景中优于基线17.07%。

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1通过平衡检索与模型知识的使用，有效提升了RAG系统的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

Motivation: 研究LLM中社会、人口和性别偏见的内部结构表示，以理解其来源和影响。

Method: 采用机制可解释性方法，分析模型内部边缘，评估偏见的稳定性、定位性和泛化性，并进行系统性消融实验。

Result: 偏见计算集中在少数层，且随微调设置变化；去除偏见组件会减少偏见输出，但也影响其他NLP任务。

Conclusion: LLM中的偏见具有局部性，去除偏见组件需权衡其对其他任务的影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩方法未过滤非证据性信息，限制了基于LLM的RAG性能。

Result: 实验表明ECoRAG在ODQA任务中优于现有压缩方法，且更高效。

Conclusion: ECoRAG通过保留必要信息提升性能并降低成本，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and
multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote
community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are

Motivation: 探索语言模型在无需参数更新的情况下，通过上下文学习进行反事实推理的能力，特别是在假设场景中预测变化后果的潜力。

Method: 采用合成线性回归任务，要求模型通过噪声推断和复制上下文噪声进行准确预测，并分析自注意力、模型深度和数据多样性对Transformer性能的影响。

Result: 语言模型在受控环境下能够进行反事实推理，且这种推理可转化为对上下文观察的变换；研究还表明Transformer能在序列数据上执行噪声推断。

Conclusion: 研究为反事实推理提供了初步证据，并展示了其在更广泛任务（如反事实故事生成）中的潜在应用。

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RELIC框架通过语言识别任务评估大语言模型（LLM）的指令跟随能力，发现即使最先进的LLM在复杂语法和样本上表现接近随机，且随着任务复杂度增加，模型倾向于依赖浅层启发式而非复杂指令。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM仅基于任务说明（无输入输出示例）完成任务的能力，即指令跟随能力。

Method: 引入RELIC框架，利用语言识别任务（判断字符串是否符合形式语法）评估LLM。任务复杂度可调，避免数据污染。

Result: LLM的准确率可通过语法和样本复杂度预测，复杂任务中表现接近随机，且模型转向依赖浅层启发式。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在复杂指令跟随任务中表现有限，需进一步改进模型能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

Conclusion: Common Pile v0.1为LLM训练提供了高质量的公开授权文本资源，解决了知识产权和伦理问题，同时释放了数据集和模型代码。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

Method: 使用编码器-解码器Transformer模型，在19种语言和13种辅助目标上进行实验，比较不同自监督任务的效果。

Result: 自动编码在数据极少时表现最佳，CMLM在数据增加时更有效；基于语素边界的掩码采样能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: 自监督任务在低资源形态建模中具有潜力，尤其是结合语素边界信息的掩码采样方法。

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

Result: 展示了不连续和连续结构可以通过统一的数学推导进行分析。

Conclusion: 通过整合三种语法形式，为自然语言结构提供了一种统一的表示和分析方法。

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

Motivation: 现有的幻觉检测方法通常将任务视为自然语言推理（NLI），但复杂的推理任务可能受益于显式的推理过程。

Result: 实验表明，这种引导式推理显著提升了幻觉检测的性能。

Conclusion: 系统化的推理框架和中间步骤的质量分析验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

Motivation: RAG系统中外部检索知识与LLMs内部知识冲突影响下游任务性能，现有方法因上下文冗长而效果不佳。

Method: 提出Micro-Act框架，通过分层动作空间感知上下文复杂度并分解知识源为细粒度比较步骤。

Result: 在5个基准数据集上显著超越现有方法，尤其在时间和语义冲突类型中表现突出。

Conclusion: Micro-Act在冲突和非冲突问题上均表现稳健，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

Conclusion: ProRefine不仅提高准确性，还能让小模型匹配大模型性能，具有高效、可扩展和普及高性能AI的潜力。

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

Method: 采用约束优化问题，使用对数边际平坦化损失强制遗忘，并通过硬约束保留有用数据。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，该方法优于现有基线，能有效移除目标信息并保持下游性能。

Conclusion: 新方法在LLM遗忘任务中表现优越，解决了现有方法的优化不稳定和性能下降问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

TL;DR: Search Arena是一个大规模、多轮对话的人类偏好数据集，用于评估搜索增强语言模型的性能，揭示了用户偏好与引用数量和来源的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集规模小、范围窄，难以全面分析搜索增强语言模型的性能，因此需要更丰富的数据集。

Method: 通过众包收集24,000对多轮用户交互数据，包含12,000个人类偏好投票，并进行跨场景分析。

Result: 用户偏好受引用数量和来源影响，社区驱动平台更受欢迎；搜索增强模型在非搜索场景表现良好，但搜索场景依赖参数知识会显著降低质量。

Conclusion: Search Arena为未来研究提供了支持，揭示了用户偏好与引用行为的关系，并开源了数据集和代码。

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型在偏好判断中存在系统性偏差，过度依赖表面特征（如长度、结构等），导致奖励黑客和不可靠评估。研究发现这些偏差源于训练数据，并提出一种基于反事实数据增强的后训练方法，有效减少偏差。


<details>

Motivation: 语言模型作为人类偏好判断的代理，存在系统性偏差，影响对齐和评估的可靠性。研究旨在量化这些偏差并提出解决方案。

Method: 使用控制反事实对量化偏好模型的偏差，提出基于反事实数据增强（CDA）的后训练方法，通过合成对比样本减少偏差。

Result: 偏好模型在60%以上的实例中表现出偏差，与人类偏好相比有40%的校准误差。CDA方法将平均校准误差从39.4%降至32.5%，偏差差异从20.5%降至10.0%。

Conclusion: 反事实数据增强能有效减少偏好模型的偏差，提升其可靠性，同时保持整体性能。

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注STEM领域的垂直推理，忽视了HSS领域对跨学科横向思维的需求。

Result: 测试了20多个主流MLLMs，发现即使是先进模型也面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: HSSBench有望推动MLLMs在跨学科推理能力上的研究。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整对抗训练扰动预算的方法（DES），通过结合梯度代理、预测置信度和模型不确定性，动态调整每个实例和训练迭代的扰动预算，显著提升了对抗鲁棒性和标准准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法依赖固定的扰动预算，无法适应实例特定的鲁棒性特征，限制了其效果。

Method: 提出动态epsilon调度（DES）框架，结合梯度代理、预测置信度和模型不确定性，动态调整扰动预算。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上，DES显著优于固定预算和现有自适应方法。

Conclusion: DES为实例感知、数据驱动的对抗训练方法开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

TL;DR: RSVP是一种新颖的多模态框架，通过视觉提示将推理与分割结合，显著提升了视觉定位和分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）缺乏明确的视觉定位和分割机制，导致认知推理与视觉感知之间存在差距。

Method: RSVP采用两阶段框架：推理阶段通过多模态链式视觉提示生成区域建议；分割阶段通过视觉语言分割模块（VLSM）优化分割掩码。

Result: RSVP在ReasonSeg上比现有方法提升6.5 gIoU和9.2 cIoU，在SegInW零样本设置下达到49.7 mAP。

Conclusion: RSVP为可解释的推理分割提供了新范式，有效整合了认知推理与结构化视觉理解。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

Method: 提出MMRB基准，包含92个子任务，涵盖空间、时间和语义推理，并设计句子级匹配框架进行快速评估。

Result: 实验表明开源MLLMs在多图像推理任务中显著落后于商业模型，且多模态奖励模型在多图像排名任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: MMRB填补了多图像推理评估的空白，揭示了当前模型的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

Abstract: 3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications
in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such
as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or
Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text
prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail,
accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over
appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data
also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human
model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these
challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset
with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a
state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping
approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based
architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion
model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the
original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human
generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with
significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality.
We will make the code and dataset available.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be

Motivation: 人类具有内部“世界模型”以进行动作规划，但当前AI模型（尤其是生成模型）如何学习此类模型尚不明确。

Method: 通过视觉观察表示状态和动作，提供“动作等效”以避免低级别连续性线索的利用，基于部分可观察半MDP框架。

Result: 前沿模型在WorldPrediction-WM和WorldPrediction-PP任务上分别仅达到57%和38%的准确率，而人类能完美解决。

Conclusion: WorldPrediction为评估世界建模和规划能力提供了可靠基准，揭示了当前AI模型与人类能力的差距。

Abstract: Humans are known to have an internal "world model" that enables us to carry
out action planning based on world states. AI agents need to have such a world
model for action planning as well. It is not clear how current AI models,
especially generative models, are able to learn such world models and carry out
procedural planning in diverse environments. We introduce WorldPrediction, a
video-based benchmark for evaluating world modeling and procedural planning
capabilities of different AI models. In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus
primarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning,
WorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal
and semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to
distinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered
sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual
distractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different
types of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across
different hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual
observations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity
cues in background scenes, we provide "action equivalents" - identical actions
observed in different contexts - as candidates for selection. This benchmark is
grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, ensuring
better reliability and robustness of the evaluation. We conduct extensive human
filtering and validation on our benchmark and show that current frontier models
barely achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP
whereas humans are able to solve both tasks perfectly.

Motivation: 冰球在视频中检测困难，现有方法未充分利用球员行为的上下文线索。球员的身体转向和视线方向为冰球位置提供了强上下文提示。

Method: PLUCC包含三个组件：上下文编码器（利用球员方向和位置）、特征金字塔编码器（提取多尺度特征）和门控解码器（结合潜在特征）。

Result: PLUCC在PuckDataset上表现优异，平均精度提升12.2%，RSLE平均精度提升25%。

Conclusion: 上下文理解对冰球检测至关重要，对自动化体育分析有广泛意义。

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical
role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with
broad implications for automated sports analysis.

Method: 使用视频Transformer架构（VideoMAE、ViViT、TimeSformer），通过数据增强和10折分层交叉验证优化模型，并在未见用户数据上进行独立评估。

Result: VideoMAE在BdSLW60和BdSLW401数据集上分别达到95.5%和81.04%的准确率，表现最佳。

Conclusion: 视频Transformer模型在孟加拉手语识别中具有强大的潜力，尤其在数据规模和质量优化的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) involves the automatic identification and
classification of sign gestures from images or video, converting them into text
or speech to improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. In
Bangladesh, Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) serves as the primary mode of
communication for many individuals with hearing impairments. This study
fine-tunes state-of-the-art video transformer architectures -- VideoMAE, ViViT,
and TimeSformer -- on BdSLW60 (arXiv:2402.08635), a small-scale BdSL dataset
with 60 frequent signs. We standardized the videos to 30 FPS, resulting in
9,307 user trial clips. To evaluate scalability and robustness, the models were
also fine-tuned on BdSLW401 (arXiv:2503.02360), a large-scale dataset with 401
sign classes. Additionally, we benchmark performance against public datasets,
including LSA64 and WLASL. Data augmentation techniques such as random
cropping, horizontal flipping, and short-side scaling were applied to improve
model robustness. To ensure balanced evaluation across folds during model
selection, we employed 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set,
while signer-independent evaluation was carried out using held-out test data
from unseen users U4 and U8. Results show that video transformer models
significantly outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning
approaches. Performance is influenced by factors such as dataset size, video
quality, frame distribution, frame rate, and model architecture. Among the
models, the VideoMAE variant (MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics)
achieved the highest accuracies of 95.5% on the frame rate corrected BdSLW60
dataset and 81.04% on the front-facing signs of BdSLW401 -- demonstrating
strong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

### [104] [Is Perturbation-Based Image Protection Disruptive to Image Editing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04394)
*Qiuyu Tang,Bonor Ayambem,Mooi Choo Chuah,Aparna Bharati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，现有的基于扰动的图像保护方法无法完全阻止扩散模型的编辑，反而可能增强编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）可能被滥用传播虚假信息或侵犯版权，需要有效的图像保护方法。

Method: 通过实验评估多种基于扰动的图像保护方法在不同领域（自然场景图像和艺术作品）和编辑任务（图像到图像生成和风格编辑）中的效果。

Result: 保护后的图像在大多数情况下仍能被成功编辑，且扰动可能增强编辑效果。

Conclusion: 基于扰动的方法不足以提供针对扩散模型编辑的鲁棒图像保护。

Abstract: The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation
and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks
associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding
imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A
fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing
attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the
reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image
protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks)
and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover
that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios,
diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image
which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that
adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given
text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences
such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods
may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against
diffusion-based editing.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种滤波器归一化方法，通过可学习的缩放和位移，使深度学习中的卷积滤波器具有大气等变性，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像滤波器经过精心归一化以确保一致性和可解释性，而深度学习中的卷积滤波器缺乏此类约束，导致在图像大气传输中响应失真。

Method: 提出滤波器归一化方法，结合可学习的缩放和位移，类似于批量归一化，使滤波器具有大气等变性。

Result: 该方法在人工和自然强度变化基准测试中表现显著提升，ResNet34甚至大幅超越CLIP。

Conclusion: 滤波器归一化不仅提升了性能，还规范了学习过程，促进了多样性，增强了鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are
carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid
artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional
filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although
they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in
the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer,
their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address
this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable
scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective
modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling
co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep
learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and
convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant
improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our
ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals
that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization
regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and
generalization.

TL;DR: HMAR是一种新的图像生成算法，通过改进VAR的问题，实现了高质量图像生成和快速采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR在图像生成中存在图像质量下降、序列长度超线性增长和采样计划固定的问题，HMAR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: HMAR采用马尔可夫过程和多步掩码生成，仅依赖前一分辨率尺度的令牌进行预测，并引入高效的块稀疏注意力内核。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256和512x512基准测试中，HMAR表现优于VAR、扩散模型和自回归基线，且训练和推理速度更快。

Conclusion: HMAR在灵活性、效率和性能上均优于VAR，适用于图像编辑任务且无需重新训练。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

Motivation: 现有方法通常假设使用设备视觉-惯性里程计系统的帧率6DoF姿态估计，可能忽略像素级重建的关键细节。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用VIBA校准滚动快门相机的精确时间戳和运动轨迹，并结合高斯泼溅的图像形成模型，以处理传感器特性。

Result: 实验表明，VIBA带来PSNR提升1 dB，图像形成模型进一步增加1 dB。

Conclusion: 本文方法显著提升了重建质量，适用于多种高斯泼溅表示，并在不同光照条件下验证了有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为“face defrontalization”的方法，通过增强训练数据集来提高面部特征提取模型的性能，避免了推理时的额外时间开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极端头部姿态下的面部识别问题，避免现有方法在小数据集上的过拟合问题。

Method: 1) 训练一个适应性的面部去正面化模型（FFWM）；2) 在原始和随机去正面化的大规模数据集上训练基于ArcFace损失的ResNet-50模型。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，但在极端姿态的小数据集（Multi-PIE）上效果有限。

Conclusion: 当前方法可能在小数据集上过拟合，去正面化方法在大型数据集上表现更优。

Abstract: Face recognition under extreme head poses is a challenging task. Ideally, a
face recognition system should perform well across different head poses, which
is known as pose-invariant face recognition. To achieve pose invariance,
current approaches rely on sophisticated methods, such as face frontalization
and various facial feature extraction model architectures. However, these
methods are somewhat impractical in real-life settings and are typically
evaluated on small scientific datasets, such as Multi-PIE. In this work, we
propose the inverse method of face frontalization, called face
defrontalization, to augment the training dataset of facial feature extraction
model. The method does not introduce any time overhead during the inference
step. The method is composed of: 1) training an adapted face defrontalization
FFWM model on a frontal-profile pairs dataset, which has been preprocessed
using our proposed face alignment method; 2) training a ResNet-50 facial
feature extraction model based on ArcFace loss on a raw and randomly
defrontalized large-scale dataset, where defrontalization was performed with
our previously trained face defrontalization model. Our method was compared
with the existing approaches on four open-access datasets: LFW, AgeDB, CFP, and
Multi-PIE. Defrontalization shows improved results compared to models without
defrontalization, while the proposed adjustments show clear superiority over
the state-of-the-art face frontalization FFWM method on three larger
open-access datasets, but not on the small Multi-PIE dataset for extreme poses
(75 and 90 degrees). The results suggest that at least some of the current
methods may be overfitted to small datasets.

TL;DR: FALO是一种硬件友好的LiDAR 3D物体检测方法，结合了高精度和快速推理速度，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LiDAR 3D检测方法依赖稀疏卷积或Transformer，计算成本高且内存访问不规则，难以在边缘设备上高效运行。

Method: FALO将稀疏3D体素排列为1D序列，通过ConvDotMix块（大核卷积、Hadamard积和线性层）处理，实现空间和嵌入维度的混合，并引入隐式分组优化推理效率。

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo基准测试中，FALO性能优异，且在移动GPU和NPU上比最新SOTA快1.6~9.8倍。

Conclusion: FALO是一种高效、硬件友好的LiDAR 3D检测方法，适合在资源受限的嵌入式设备上部署。

Abstract: Existing LiDAR 3D object detection methods predominantely rely on sparse
convolutions and/or transformers, which can be challenging to run on
resource-constrained edge devices, due to irregular memory access patterns and
high computational costs. In this paper, we propose FALO, a hardware-friendly
approach to LiDAR 3D detection, which offers both state-of-the-art (SOTA)
detection accuracy and fast inference speed. More specifically, given the 3D
point cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a
1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then
processed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel
convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides
sufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and
introduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features.
Furthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit
grouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and
takes into account the growing receptive field. All these operations are
friendly to run on resource-constrained platforms and proposed FALO can readily
deploy on compact, embedded devices. Our extensive evaluation on LiDAR 3D
detection benchmarks such as nuScenes and Waymo shows that FALO achieves
competitive performance. Meanwhile, FALO is 1.6~9.8x faster than the latest
SOTA on mobile Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and mobile Neural Processing Unit
(NPU).

Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测技术依赖训练时学到的统计特征，难以应对新的伪造方法。

Method: 结合分类任务与图像-文本对比学习，利用MLLM生成文本指导，并集成数据不确定性学习。

Result: 在DFDC和DF40数据集上AUC分别提升6.15%和16.68%，在DDVQA数据集上性能提升24.69%。

Conclusion: AuthGuard通过语言指导和视觉-语言对比学习，实现了更泛化和可解释的深度伪造检测。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection techniques struggle to keep-up with the
ever-evolving novel, unseen forgeries methods. This limitation stems from their
reliance on statistical artifacts learned during training, which are often tied
to specific generation processes that may not be representative of samples from
new, unseen deepfake generation methods encountered at test time. We propose
that incorporating language guidance can improve deepfake detection
generalization by integrating human-like commonsense reasoning -- such as
recognizing logical inconsistencies and perceptual anomalies -- alongside
statistical cues. To achieve this, we train an expert deepfake vision encoder
by combining discriminative classification with image-text contrastive
learning, where the text is generated by generalist MLLMs using few-shot
prompting. This allows the encoder to extract both language-describable,
commonsense deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts from
pixel-level distributions. To further enhance robustness, we integrate data
uncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, mitigating
noise in image-text supervision. Our expert vision encoder seamlessly
interfaces with an LLM, further enabling more generalized and interpretable
deepfake detection while also boosting accuracy. The resulting framework,
AuthGuard, achieves state-of-the-art deepfake detection accuracy in both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, achieving AUC gains of 6.15%
on the DFDC dataset and 16.68% on the DF40 dataset. Additionally, AuthGuard
significantly enhances deepfake reasoning, improving performance by 24.69% on
the DDVQA dataset.

Conclusion: 该方法为剪枝领域开辟了新方向，同时提升了模型效率和鲁棒性，并显著减少碳排放。

Abstract: Deep learning stands as the modern paradigm for solving cognitive tasks.
However, as the problem complexity increases, models grow deeper and
computationally prohibitive, hindering advancements in real-world and
resource-constrained applications. Extensive studies reveal that pruning
structures in these models efficiently reduces model complexity and improves
computational efficiency. Successful strategies in this sphere include removing
neurons (i.e., filters, heads) or layers, but not both together. Therefore,
simultaneously pruning different structures remains an open problem. To fill
this gap and leverage the benefits of eliminating neurons and layers at once,
we propose a new method capable of pruning different structures within a model
as follows. Given two candidate subnetworks (pruned models), one from layer
pruning and the other from neuron pruning, our method decides which to choose
by selecting the one with the highest representation similarity to its parent
(the network that generates the subnetworks) using the Centered Kernel
Alignment metric. Iteratively repeating this process provides highly sparse
models that preserve the original predictive ability. Throughout extensive
experiments on standard architectures and benchmarks, we confirm the
effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
layer and filter pruning techniques. At high levels of Floating Point
Operations reduction, most state-of-the-art methods degrade accuracy, whereas
our approach either improves it or experiences only a minimal drop. Notably, on
the popular ResNet56 and ResNet110, we achieve a milestone of 86.37% and 95.82%
FLOPs reduction. Besides, our pruned models obtain robustness to adversarial
and out-of-distribution samples and take an important step towards GreenAI,
reducing carbon emissions by up to 83.31%. Overall, we believe our work opens a
new chapter in pruning.

Conclusion: EECD-Net为资源受限环境下的实时大规模基础设施监测提供了可扩展的低功耗解决方案。

Abstract: Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the
instrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and
transportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution
imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring
performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage
detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and
energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated
Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address
the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image
resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike
Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is
proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly
reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT)
module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations
through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range
dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing
detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the
CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\%
detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as
Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains
exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial
33\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a
transformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a
scalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure
monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 现有方法通常通过间接方式（如专用损失函数）提升SISR性能，而LSKs旨在直接从频率角度增强图像质量。

Method: LSKs设计为秩一矩阵，可分解为正交且可合并的一维核，从而减少参数和计算量。

Result: 实验表明，LSKs减少了60%以上的参数和计算需求，同时提升了模型性能，尤其在高放大因子下表现更优。

Conclusion: LSKs是一种高效且有效的SISR增强模块，适用于多种场景，尤其在高放大任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Existing approaches often enhance the performance of single-image
super-resolution (SISR) methods by incorporating auxiliary structures, such as
specialized loss functions, to indirectly boost the quality of low-resolution
images. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play module called Learnable
Separable Kernels (LSKs), which are formally rank-one matrices designed to
directly enhance image frequency components. We begin by explaining why LSKs
are particularly suitable for SISR tasks from a frequency perspective. Baseline
methods incorporating LSKs demonstrate a significant reduction of over 60\% in
both the number of parameters and computational requirements. This reduction is
achieved through the decomposition of LSKs into orthogonal and mergeable
one-dimensional kernels. Additionally, we perform an interpretable analysis of
the feature maps generated by LSKs. Visualization results reveal the capability
of LSKs to enhance image frequency components effectively. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating LSKs not only reduces the number of
parameters and computational load but also improves overall model performance.
Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that models utilizing LSKs exhibit
superior performance, particularly as the upscaling factor increases.

Result: 在数学和科学多模态基准测试中达到最优性能，支持高效扩展和即插即用。

Conclusion: RACRO显著提升了视觉与推理的对齐，避免了昂贵的多模态重新对齐需求。

Abstract: Recent advances in slow-thinking language models (e.g., OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks
by emulating human-like reflective cognition. However, extending such
capabilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging
due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading
the underlying reasoner LLMs. A straightforward solution is to decouple
perception from reasoning, i.e., converting visual inputs into language
representations (e.g., captions) that are then passed to a powerful text-only
reasoner. However, this decoupling introduces a critical challenge: the visual
extractor must generate descriptions that are both faithful to the image and
informative enough to support accurate downstream reasoning. To address this,
we propose Reasoning-Aligned Perceptual Decoupling via Caption Reward
Optimization (RACRO) - a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that
aligns the extractor's captioning behavior with the reasoning objective. By
closing the perception-reasoning loop via reward-based optimization, RACRO
significantly enhances visual grounding and extracts reasoning-optimized
representations. Experiments on multi-modal math and science benchmarks show
that the proposed RACRO method achieves state-of-the-art average performance
while enabling superior scalability and plug-and-play adaptation to more
advanced reasoning LLMs without the necessity for costly multi-modal
re-alignment.

Abstract: Most of the current top-down multi-person pose estimation lightweight methods
are based on multi-branch parallel pure CNN network architecture, which often
struggle to capture the global context required for detecting semantically
complex keypoints and are hindered by high latency due to their intricate and
redundant structures. In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight
global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In
the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed
Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates
information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation
Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel
Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively
integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often
observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and
MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of
parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also
achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Creation框架有效利用基础模型的先验知识，支持灵活的4D视频生成与编辑，性能优越。

Abstract: We introduce Follow-Your-Creation, a novel 4D video creation framework
capable of both generating and editing 4D content from a single monocular video
input. By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a
generative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task,
enabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory
changes or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked
inpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video
generation. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first
perform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that
indicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks
are introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined
with the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During
training, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and
challenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and
robustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal
consistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning
strategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the
model is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning
iteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference
to enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior
knowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance,
enabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence. In
addition, our approach supports prompt-based content editing, demonstrating
strong flexibility and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in
both quality and versatility.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分层持续学习框架（HEC）和任务感知的增量LoRA专家混合方法（Task-aware MoILE），以解决现有方法忽视高级规划和多级知识学习的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法主要关注基于人类命令执行低级动作，而忽视了高级规划和多级知识的学习能力。

Method: 提出HEC框架，将学习过程分为高级指令和低级动作两层，并定义五个子任务。Task-aware MoILE通过聚类视觉-文本嵌入识别任务，使用任务级和令牌级路由器选择LoRA专家，并通过SVD保留关键参数以减少灾难性遗忘。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在减少旧任务遗忘方面优于其他方法，有效支持代理在持续学习新任务时保留先验知识。

Conclusion: HEC框架和Task-aware MoILE方法在持续学习中表现出色，特别是在高级规划和多级知识保留方面。

Abstract: Previous continual learning setups for embodied intelligence focused on
executing low-level actions based on human commands, neglecting the ability to
learn high-level planning and multi-level knowledge. To address these issues,
we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that
divide the agent's continual learning process into two layers: high-level
instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning
sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of
Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task
recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level
router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To
effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks,
preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts. The
experimental results show that our method stands out in reducing the forgetting
of old tasks compared to other methods, effectively supporting agents in
retaining prior knowledge while continuously learning new tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmartAvatar是一个基于视觉-语言-代理的框架，可从单张照片或文本提示生成完全绑定、动画就绪的3D人体化身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散方法在3D对象生成中难以精确控制人体身份、体型和动画就绪性，SmartAvatar旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）和现成的参数化人体生成器，通过自主验证循环迭代调整生成参数。

Result: 生成的化身质量高、可定制，支持姿势操作，适用于动画和交互应用，在多个指标上优于现有系统。

Conclusion: SmartAvatar通过AI引导的交互式细化过程，提供了一种高效、灵活的3D化身生成工具。

Abstract: SmartAvatar is a vision-language-agent-driven framework for generating fully
rigged, animation-ready 3D human avatars from a single photo or textual prompt.
While diffusion-based methods have made progress in general 3D object
generation, they continue to struggle with precise control over human identity,
body shape, and animation readiness. In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the
commonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in
combination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver
high-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous
verification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial
similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively
adjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided
refinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body
features, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via
natural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static
pre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users
into the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven
procedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully
rigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance,
making them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications.
Quantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar
outperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of
reconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and
animation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable
avatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Perfecting Depth的两阶段框架，通过结合随机不确定性建模和确定性优化，提升传感器深度图的可靠性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传感器深度图中不可靠区域的自动检测问题，同时保留几何线索，以提高深度图的实用性和准确性。

Method: 第一阶段（随机估计）利用扩散模型的随机性检测不可靠区域并推断几何结构；第二阶段（确定性优化）基于不确定性图强制结构一致性和像素级精度。

Result: 实验证明该方法能生成密集、无伪影的深度图，并在多种实际场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架为传感器深度增强设定了新基准，适用于自动驾驶、机器人和沉浸式技术等领域。

Abstract: We propose a novel two-stage framework for sensor depth enhancement, called
Perfecting Depth. This framework leverages the stochastic nature of diffusion
models to automatically detect unreliable depth regions while preserving
geometric cues. In the first stage (stochastic estimation), the method
identifies unreliable measurements and infers geometric structure by leveraging
a training-inference domain gap. In the second stage (deterministic
refinement), it enforces structural consistency and pixel-level accuracy using
the uncertainty map derived from the first stage. By combining stochastic
uncertainty modeling with deterministic refinement, our method yields dense,
artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability. Experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse real-world scenarios. Furthermore,
theoretical analysis, various experiments, and qualitative visualizations
validate its robustness and scalability. Our framework sets a new baseline for
sensor depth enhancement, with potential applications in autonomous driving,
robotics, and immersive technologies.

Motivation: 传统图像匹配流程在复杂场景中表现不佳，深度学习为提升性能提供了新思路。

Method: 综述了深度学习如何替代传统流程的各个步骤，并整合为端到端模块，包括可学习检测器-描述符、异常值过滤器和几何估计器。

Result: 在相对位姿恢复、单应性估计和视觉定位任务中评估了代表性方法，展示了深度学习的优势。

Conclusion: 深度学习显著推动了图像匹配领域的发展，但仍存在挑战，未来研究需进一步创新。

Abstract: Image matching, which establishes correspondences between two-view images to
recover 3D structure and camera geometry, serves as a cornerstone in computer
vision and underpins a wide range of applications, including visual
localization, 3D reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM). Traditional pipelines composed of ``detector-descriptor, feature
matcher, outlier filter, and geometric estimator'' falter in challenging
scenarios. Recent deep-learning advances have significantly boosted both
robustness and accuracy. This survey adopts a unique perspective by
comprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the
classical image matching pipeline. Our taxonomy highly aligns with the
traditional pipeline in two key aspects: i) the replacement of individual steps
in the traditional pipeline with learnable alternatives, including learnable
detector-descriptor, outlier filter, and geometric estimator; and ii) the
merging of multiple steps into end-to-end learnable modules, encompassing
middle-end sparse matcher, end-to-end semi-dense/dense matcher, and pose
regressor. We first examine the design principles, advantages, and limitations
of both aspects, and then benchmark representative methods on relative pose
recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks. Finally, we
discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research.
By systematically categorizing and evaluating deep learning-driven strategies,
this survey offers a clear overview of the evolving image matching landscape
and highlights key avenues for further innovation.

TL;DR: STARE是一个评估多模态大语言模型在空间认知任务中表现的基准，涵盖几何变换、空间推理和现实世界应用。模型在简单任务中表现良好，但在复杂任务中接近随机水平，且无法有效利用视觉模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI基准主要关注语言推理，忽视了非语言、多步视觉模拟的复杂性。STARE旨在填补这一空白，评估模型在空间认知任务中的能力。

Method: STARE包含4K任务，涵盖2D/3D几何变换、立方体折叠、七巧板拼图及现实空间推理。通过对比人类和模型的表现，分析视觉模拟的作用。

Result: 模型在简单2D任务中表现良好，但在复杂任务（如3D折叠和七巧板）中接近随机水平。人类通过视觉模拟显著提升速度，而模型表现不一致。

Conclusion: 模型在多步视觉模拟任务中表现不佳，表明其无法有效利用中间视觉信息。未来研究需改进模型在复杂空间推理中的能力。

Abstract: Spatial cognition is essential for human intelligence, enabling
problem-solving through visual simulations rather than solely relying on verbal
reasoning. However, existing AI benchmarks primarily assess verbal reasoning,
neglecting the complexities of non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation. We
introduce STARE(Spatial Transformations and Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark
designed to rigorously evaluate multimodal large language models on tasks
better solved through multi-step visual simulation. STARE features 4K tasks
spanning foundational geometric transformations (2D and 3D), integrated spatial
reasoning (cube net folding and tangram puzzles), and real-world spatial
reasoning (perspective and temporal reasoning), reflecting practical cognitive
challenges like object assembly, mechanical diagram interpretation, and
everyday spatial navigation. Our evaluations show that models excel at
reasoning over simpler 2D transformations, but perform close to random chance
on more complex tasks like 3D cube net folding and tangram puzzles that require
multi-step visual simulations. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy but take
considerable time (up to 28.9s) on complex tasks, significantly speeding up
(down by 7.5 seconds on average) with intermediate visual simulations. In
contrast, models exhibit inconsistent performance gains from visual
simulations, improving on most tasks but declining in specific cases like
tangram puzzles (GPT-4o, o1) and cube net folding (Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.0
Flash), indicating that models may not know how to effectively leverage
intermediate visual information.

Abstract: The introduction of generative models has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR) in handling real-world degradations. However, they often
incur fidelity-related issues, particularly distorting textual structures. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based SR framework, namely TADiSR,
which integrates text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders to
recover not only natural details but also the structural fidelity of text
regions in degraded real-world images. Moreover, we propose a complete pipeline
for synthesizing high-quality images with fine-grained full-image text masks,
combining realistic foreground text regions with detailed background content.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances text
legibility in super-resolved images, achieving state-of-the-art performance
across multiple evaluation metrics and exhibiting strong generalization to
real-world scenarios. Our code is available at

TL;DR: FPSAttention结合FP8量化和稀疏性优化视频生成，显著提升速度且不损失质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散生成模型虽能生成高质量视频，但推理速度慢且计算需求高，现有量化与稀疏性结合方法因缺乏联合优化导致性能下降。

Method: 提出FPSAttention，通过统一3D分块粒度、噪声步感知策略及硬件友好内核，联合优化FP8量化和稀疏性。

Result: 在720p分辨率下，注意力操作提速7.09倍，端到端视频生成提速4.96倍，且生成质量未下降。

Conclusion: FPSAttention为高效视频生成提供了联合优化的量化与稀疏性解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have become the standard for producing
high-quality, coherent video content, yet their slow inference speeds and high
computational demands hinder practical deployment. Although both quantization
and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining
generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing
training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to
the lack of joint optimization.We introduce FPSAttention, a novel
training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation,
with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach
features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that
simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising
step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong
correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A
native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is
implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient
execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench
benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention
operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the
BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表示学习假设解耦的独立特征轴是好的表示，但无法解释条件独立性。因此，需要一种更通用的表示方法。

Method: 通过结合特征提取和对象分割，将像素平移替换为特征平移，并将对象分割定义为在相同变换下对特征进行分组。

Result: 在包含真实世界对象和背景的数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法有望更好地理解人类在现实世界中的对象识别发展。

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

Motivation: 现有自解释模型在数据稀缺时表现不佳，主要由于参数不平衡和表示错位。

Method: 采用Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLE)实现参数高效适应，结合跨模块概念指导和几何感知概念判别损失。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，FSPCC相对现有方法提升了4.2%-8.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: FSPCC框架在提升模型准确性和可解释性方面具有显著效果，为透明视觉识别系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Self-Explainable Models (SEMs) rely on Prototypical Concept Learning (PCL) to
enable their visual recognition processes more interpretable, but they often
struggle in data-scarce settings where insufficient training samples lead to
suboptimal performance.To address this limitation, we propose a Few-Shot
Prototypical Concept Classification (FSPCC) framework that systematically
mitigates two key challenges under low-data regimes: parametric imbalance and
representation misalignment. Specifically, our approach leverages a Mixture of
LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, ensuring a balanced
allocation of trainable parameters between the backbone and the PCL
module.Meanwhile, cross-module concept guidance enforces tight alignment
between the backbone's feature representations and the prototypical concept
activation patterns.In addition, we incorporate a multi-level feature
preservation strategy that fuses spatial and semantic cues across various
layers, thereby enriching the learned representations and mitigating the
challenges posed by limited data availability.Finally, to enhance
interpretability and minimize concept overlap, we introduce a geometry-aware
concept discrimination loss that enforces orthogonality among concepts,
encouraging more disentangled and transparent decision boundaries.Experimental
results on six popular benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS,
Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and DTD) demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms existing SEMs by a notable margin, with 4.2%-8.7%
relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification.These findings highlight the
efficacy of coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve both
higher accuracy and clearer model interpretability, paving the way for more
transparent visual recognition systems.

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val显著提升了合成数据的质量和模型性能，适用于实例分割和目标检测任务。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are
essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network
planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements
remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack
environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed
scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a
Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and
Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS
focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature
representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction
accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that
MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low
computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

Result: SafeLLaVA在多个VLM基准测试中达到最先进的安全性能，HoliSafe揭示了现有模型的漏洞。

Conclusion: HoliSafe和SafeLLaVA为VLM安全性研究提供了新方向，推动多模态对齐的进一步发展。

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

Conclusion: 多模态模型的图像和文本表示在浅层分离，但在深层逐渐融合，稀疏自编码器可提升特征的可解释性。

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过部分微调视觉编码器和两种增强技术（检索增强和对抗扰动）提升预训练视觉语言模型（VLM）在少样本适应中的分布内（ID）和分布外（OOD）准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的VLM在少样本适应中表现良好，但在面对OOD数据时性能下降，因此需要提升其OOD泛化能力。

Method: 比较了多种适应方法（如提示调整、线性探测、对比微调和完全微调），并提出部分微调视觉编码器结合检索增强和对抗扰动的两阶段方法（SRAPF）。

Result: SRAPF在ImageNet OOD基准测试中实现了最先进的ID和OOD准确性。

Conclusion: 部分微调视觉编码器结合检索增强和对抗扰动的两阶段方法（SRAPF）能有效平衡ID和OOD准确性。

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs achieve strong performance on downstream tasks when adapted
with just a few labeled examples. As the adapted models inevitably encounter
out-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)
task-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot
adaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,
aiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full
finetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper
hyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods
prompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves
better efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and
textual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides
the best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we
propose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple
augmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves
task-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,
and (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.
Results show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly
sacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining
the two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma
with the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial
Partial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the
visual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial
finetuning with few-shot ID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAPF
achieves the state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on the ImageNet OOD
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多维度特征（技术质量、运动质量和视频语义）的AIGV视觉质量评估方法，结合LLM和LoRA微调技术，在NTIRE 2025挑战赛中取得第二名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGV技术快速发展，但存在视觉质量缺陷（如噪声、模糊等），影响用户体验，因此需要有效的自动视觉质量评估方法。

Method: 将视觉质量分解为三个维度，设计对应编码器提取特征，引入LLM作为回归模块，并提出多模态提示工程框架和LoRA微调技术。

Result: 在NTIRE 2025挑战赛中排名第二，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多维度特征和LLM的结合，显著提升了AIGV视觉质量评估的准确性。

Abstract: The development of AI-Generated Video (AIGV) technology has been remarkable
in recent years, significantly transforming the paradigm of video content
production. However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects,
such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely
impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual
quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and
generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of
AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video
semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve
effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding
performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language
tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable
the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features
and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt
engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology
during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks.
Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality
Assessment of AI-Generated Content Challenge: Track 2 AI Generated video,
demonstrating its effectiveness. Codes can be obtained at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法iDPOE，通过隐式扩散策略和等变表示改进内窥镜黏膜下剥离术（ESD）视频中的轨迹预测，提升手术技能训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测ESD视频中的剥离轨迹对手术技能训练和学习过程有重要意义，但目前研究不足。现有模仿学习方法在应对不确定的未来动作、几何对称性和多样化手术场景方面存在挑战。

Method: 提出iDPOE方法，结合扩散模型和等变表示，建模专家行为的联合状态动作分布，并通过前向过程引导的动作推理策略解决状态不匹配问题。

Result: 在近2000个ESD视频片段的数据集上，iDPOE在轨迹预测上超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: iDPOE是首个将模仿学习应用于手术技能训练中剥离轨迹预测的方法，展现了显著优势。

Abstract: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a well-established technique for
removing epithelial lesions. Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos
offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and
simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While
imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert
demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements,
learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios.
To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with
Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models
expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the
stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual
representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a
diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and
sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.
Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric
symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address
state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy
for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips,
experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical
skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.

TL;DR: LAT框架通过标签对齐和特征融合，解决多数据集标注不一致问题，提升目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数据集结合可提升泛化能力，但标注不一致（语义和空间）阻碍了这一过程。现有方法需共享标签空间或手动标注，不够灵活。

Method: 提出LAT框架：1) 训练数据集特定检测器生成伪标签；2) 使用PPG结合伪标签与真实标注；3) 通过SFF模块融合语义特征。

Result: LAT在多个基准测试中表现优异，目标域检测性能提升高达+4.8AP。

Conclusion: LAT无需共享标签空间或手动标注，有效解决了标注不一致问题，显著提升检测性能。

Abstract: Combining multiple object detection datasets offers a path to improved
generalisation but is hindered by inconsistencies in class semantics and
bounding box annotations. Some methods to address this assume shared label
taxonomies and address only spatial inconsistencies; others require manual
relabelling, or produce a unified label space, which may be unsuitable when a
fixed target label space is required. We propose Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT),
a label transfer framework that systematically projects annotations from
diverse source datasets into the label space of a target dataset. LAT begins by
training dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then
combined with ground-truth annotations via a Privileged Proposal Generator
(PPG) that replaces the region proposal network in two-stage detectors. To
further refine region features, a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module injects
class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals using a
confidence-weighted attention mechanism. This pipeline preserves
dataset-specific annotation granularity while enabling many-to-one label space
transfer across heterogeneous datasets, resulting in a semantically and
spatially aligned representation suitable for training a downstream detector.
LAT thus jointly addresses both class-level misalignments and bounding box
inconsistencies without relying on shared label spaces or manual annotations.
Across multiple benchmarks, LAT demonstrates consistent improvements in
target-domain detection performance, achieving gains of up to +4.8AP over
semi-supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对视觉语言模型（VLMs）后门攻击的防御方法——语义奖励防御（SRD），通过强化学习框架减少恶意行为，无需预先知道触发器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现VLMs在图像描述任务中易受后门攻击，攻击者通过注入微小扰动控制模型输出恶意描述。现有方法难以检测和防御此类攻击。

Method: 提出SRD框架，利用深度Q网络学习对敏感图像区域施加离散扰动（如遮挡、颜色掩码），以破坏恶意路径的激活。通过语义保真度评分作为奖励信号，指导生成鲁棒且准确的描述。

Result: 实验表明，SRD将攻击成功率降至5.6%，同时在干净输入上保持描述质量，性能下降小于10%。

Conclusion: SRD为多模态生成模型中的后门威胁提供了一种无需触发器、可解释的防御范式。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in image
captioning, but recent studies show they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks.
Attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers
or global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to
generate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These
attacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal
nature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1)
abnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic
drift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose
Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that
mitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a
Deep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g.,
occlusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the
activation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the
reward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic
fluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful
captions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces
attack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs
with less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic,
interpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal
generative models.

Method: 采用双流架构，一分支通过物理估计器估计透射图和背景光，另一分支通过胶囊聚类提取特征，结合物理约束和感知质量优化目标。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，PSNR提升0.5dB，计算复杂度仅为现有最佳方法的三分之一。

Conclusion: 该方法在物理约束和感知质量上均表现出色，计算效率高。

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art
underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery
physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning.
Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting
entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This
physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third
of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB
PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

<details>

Motivation: 传统多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）依赖大量训练数据，导致数据冗余和计算成本高。论文挑战这一假设，认为仅需少量高价值样本即可提升多模态推理能力。

Method: 提出RAP范式，包含两个互补的估计器（CDE和ACE）识别认知样本，并通过DRM模块替换简单样本以增强复杂性。

Result: 在六个数据集上，RAP仅需9.3%的训练数据即可实现更优性能，计算成本降低43%以上。

Conclusion: RAP证明了通过精选高价值样本，可在减少数据量和计算成本的同时提升多模态推理能力。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的SSIM形式，通过加法而非乘法组合其组件，改进了无监督单目深度学习的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法忽略了SSIM函数中不同组件及超参数对训练的影响，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出新的SSIM形式，用加法组合亮度、对比度和结构相似性组件，构造更平滑的梯度损失函数。

Result: 在KITTI-2015数据集上，优化后的SSIM损失函数显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 新SSIM形式提升了无监督深度估计的性能，为相关研究提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Unsupervised monocular depth learning generally relies on the photometric
relation among temporally adjacent images. Most of previous works use both mean
absolute error (MAE) and structure similarity index measure (SSIM) with
conventional form as training loss. However, they ignore the effect of
different components in the SSIM function and the corresponding hyperparameters
on the training. To address these issues, this work proposes a new form of
SSIM. Compared with original SSIM function, the proposed new form uses addition
rather than multiplication to combine the luminance, contrast, and structural
similarity related components in SSIM. The loss function constructed with this
scheme helps result in smoother gradients and achieve higher performance on
unsupervised depth estimation. We conduct extensive experiments to determine
the relatively optimal combination of parameters for our new SSIM. Based on the
popular MonoDepth approach, the optimized SSIM loss function can remarkably
outperform the baseline on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset.

Conclusion: HypeVPR通过双曲空间的分层嵌入和高效搜索策略，显著提升了P2E VPR的性能和效率。

Abstract: When applying Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to real-world mobile robots and
similar applications, perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation
naturally emerges as a suitable approach to accommodate diverse query images
captured from various viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel
hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the
unique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual
environments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical
structures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent
hierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the
feature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation
mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within
hyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine
search strategy, optimally balancing speed and accuracy to ensure robust
matching, even between descriptors from different image types. This approach
enables HypeVPR to outperform state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing retrieval time, achieving up to 5x faster retrieval across diverse
benchmark datasets. The code and models will be released at

TL;DR: Object-X是一个多功能多模态对象表示框架，能够编码丰富的对象嵌入并解码为详细的几何和视觉重建，支持多种下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖任务特定的嵌入，无法同时支持几何重建和跨任务复用，因此需要一种更通用的多模态3D对象表示方法。

Method: Object-X通过将捕获的多模态数据几何地锚定在3D体素网格中，并学习融合体素信息与对象属性的非结构化嵌入，实现3D高斯泼溅重建。

Result: 在真实数据集上，Object-X实现了高保真的新视角合成，几何精度显著提升，同时在场景对齐和定位任务中表现优异，存储需求极低。

Conclusion: Object-X是一种可扩展且实用的多模态3D场景表示解决方案，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for
numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods
often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic
understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings
typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused
across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal
object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings
(e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric
and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the
captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding
fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned
embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also
supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image
3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging
real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view
synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly
improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive
performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization.
Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less
storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches,
establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for
multi-modal 3D scene representation.

Conclusion: LotusFilter高效且实用，适用于需要多样化搜索结果的场景。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

Method: 提出SupeRANSAC，一种统一的RANSAC管道，详细分析了使RANSAC在特定视觉任务中有效的技术。

Result: SupeRANSAC在多个任务和数据集上显著优于现有方法，例如在基础矩阵估计中平均提高6 AUC点。

Conclusion: SupeRANSAC为计算机视觉任务提供了一种高性能且一致的鲁棒性估计解决方案。

Abstract: Robust estimation is a cornerstone in computer vision, particularly for tasks
like Structure-from-Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. RANSAC
and its variants are the gold standard for estimating geometric models (e.g.,
homographies, relative/absolute poses) from outlier-contaminated data. Despite
RANSAC's apparent simplicity, achieving consistently high performance across
different problems is challenging. While recent research often focuses on
improving specific RANSAC components (e.g., sampling, scoring), overall
performance is frequently more influenced by the "bells and whistles" (i.e.,
the implementation details and problem-specific optimizations) within a given
library. Popular frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib demonstrate varying
performance, excelling in some tasks but lagging in others. We introduce
SupeRANSAC, a novel unified RANSAC pipeline, and provide a detailed analysis of
the techniques that make RANSAC effective for specific vision tasks, including
homography, fundamental/essential matrix, and absolute/rigid pose estimation.
SupeRANSAC is designed for consistent accuracy across these tasks, improving
upon the best existing methods by, for example, 6 AUC points on average for
fundamental matrix estimation. We demonstrate significant performance
improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple problems and datasets. Code:

Conclusion: MegaHan97K填补了大规模汉字识别数据集的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Foundational to the Chinese language and culture, Chinese characters
encompass extraordinarily extensive and ever-expanding categories, with the
latest Chinese GB18030-2022 standard containing 87,887 categories. The accurate
recognition of this vast number of characters, termed mega-category
recognition, presents a formidable yet crucial challenge for cultural heritage
preservation and digital applications. Despite significant advances in Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), mega-category recognition remains unexplored due
to the absence of comprehensive datasets, with the largest existing dataset
containing merely 16,151 categories. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce
MegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset covering an unprecedented
97,455 categories of Chinese characters. Our work offers three major
contributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest
GB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than
existing datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution
problem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three
distinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3)
Comprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category
scenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar
character recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also
unlocking substantial opportunities for future research. To the best of our
knowledge, the MetaHan97K is likely the dataset with the largest classes not
only in the field of OCR but may also in the broader domain of pattern
recognition. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based
sensors, including higher temporal resolution, lower latency and dynamic range.
However, efficiently converting event streams into formats compatible with
standard computer vision pipelines remains a challenging problem, particularly
in the presence of noise. In this paper, we propose Spike-TBR, a novel
event-based encoding strategy based on Temporal Binary Representation (TBR),
addressing its vulnerability to noise by integrating spiking neurons. Spike-TBR
combines the frame-based advantages of TBR with the noise-filtering
capabilities of spiking neural networks, creating a more robust representation
of event streams. We evaluate four variants of Spike-TBR, each using different
spiking neurons, across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance
in noise-affected scenarios while improving the results on clean data. Our
method bridges the gap between spike-based and frame-based processing, offering
a simple noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of
autonomous vehicles have been successfully demonstrated so far. However, only a
few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how
CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We
propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with
a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on
pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with
printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile
traffic light for construction sites and in a test area with stationary traffic
lights. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DualX-VSR提出了一种新颖的双轴空间×时间注意力机制，用于解决视频超分辨率任务中的像素级精度问题，无需运动补偿，性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的视频超分辨率模型在像素级精度和运动补偿方面存在局限性，DualX-VSR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: DualX-VSR采用双轴空间×时间注意力机制，沿正交方向整合时空信息，简化结构并避免运动补偿。

Result: DualX-VSR在真实世界视频超分辨率任务中实现了高保真度和卓越性能。

Conclusion: DualX-VSR通过新颖的注意力机制解决了现有模型的局限性，为视频超分辨率任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based models like ViViT and TimeSformer have advanced video
understanding by effectively modeling spatiotemporal dependencies. Recent video
generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of
transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal
modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video
super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision,
which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms.
While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using
smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as
restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment,
which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these
issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for
Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual
axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and
temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need
for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a
cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR
achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的2D感知系统依赖显式指令或预定义类别，而3D推理分割缺乏类似框架。

Method: 引入SEG token和对象标识符，处理点云数据和文本提示，生成高精度3D分割掩码。

Result: 在ScanNet数据集上验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: OpenMaskDINO3D为3D推理分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Although perception systems have made remarkable advancements in recent
years, particularly in 2D reasoning segmentation, these systems still rely on
explicit human instruction or pre-defined categories to identify target objects
before executing visual recognition tasks. Such systems have matured
significantly, demonstrating the ability to reason and comprehend implicit user
intentions in two-dimensional contexts, producing accurate segmentation masks
based on complex and implicit query text. However, a comparable framework and
structure for 3D reasoning segmentation remain absent. This paper introduces
OpenMaskDINO3D, a LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding and
segmentation. OpenMaskDINO3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to
produce instance segmentation masks, excelling in many 3D tasks. By introducing
a SEG token and object identifier, we achieve high-precision 3D segmentation
mask generation, enabling the model to directly produce accurate point cloud
segmentation results from natural language instructions. Experimental results
on large-scale ScanNet datasets validate the effectiveness of our
OpenMaskDINO3D across various tasks.

Result: 在不同水印模型上进行了广泛实验，攻击成功率显著，且水印特性分析进一步验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了隐形触发器的高效嵌入，为图像编辑中的后门攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation
and editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to
backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can
manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has
proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving
backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies
targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical
because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before
editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds
invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data.
We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible
watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the
predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing
clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments
across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising
attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark
characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of
our approach. The code is available

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于直觉驱动的规划方法，通过对比学习训练Transformer编码器，将棋盘状态嵌入到潜在空间中，实现无需深度搜索的走子选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代国际象棋引擎依赖深度树搜索和回归评估，而人类玩家则依靠直觉选择候选走法并进行浅层搜索验证。论文旨在模拟这种直觉驱动的规划过程。

Method: 使用监督对比学习训练Transformer编码器，将棋盘状态嵌入到按位置评估结构化的潜在空间中。走子选择通过向有利区域移动实现，无需深度搜索。

Result: 模型仅使用6层束搜索，估计Elo评分为2593。性能随模型规模和嵌入维度提升，表明潜在规划可能是传统搜索的可行替代方案。

Conclusion: 尽管聚焦国际象棋，但提出的基于嵌入的规划方法可推广到其他完美信息游戏，前提是状态评估可学习。所有源代码已开源。

Abstract: Modern chess engines achieve superhuman performance through deep tree search
and regressive evaluation, while human players rely on intuition to select
candidate moves followed by a shallow search to validate them. To model this
intuition-driven planning process, we train a transformer encoder using
supervised contrastive learning to embed board states into a latent space
structured by positional evaluation. In this space, distance reflects
evaluative similarity, and visualized trajectories display interpretable
transitions between game states. We demonstrate that move selection can occur
entirely within this embedding space by advancing toward favorable regions,
without relying on deep search. Despite using only a 6-ply beam search, our
model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593. Performance improves with both
model size and embedding dimensionality, suggesting that latent planning may
offer a viable alternative to traditional search. Although we focus on chess,
the proposed embedding-based planning method can be generalized to other
perfect-information games where state evaluations are learnable. All source
code is available at https://github.com/andrewhamara/SOLIS.

Motivation: 探索3D视觉定位中超越对象级别的任务，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 引入Anywhere3D-Bench基准，评估多种先进模型在四个不同层次任务上的表现。

Result: 空间和部分级别任务表现最差，最佳模型OpenAI o4-mini在空间任务上仅23.57%准确率。

Conclusion: 当前模型在3D场景的空间和部分级别理解上存在显著不足。

Abstract: 3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within
complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in
3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a
holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,632 referring
expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels:
human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, objects in the scene,
and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual
grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and
part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks
require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling
distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand
fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model,
OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.57% accuracy on space-level tasks and 33.94%
on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and
object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models'
capacity to understand and reason about 3D scene beyond object-level semantics.

Motivation: 探索一种高效且低成本的立体数据集生成方法，以替代传统的NeRF方法，并提升深度立体模型的零样本泛化能力。

Method: 结合3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）和FoundationStereo模型的深度估计，通过专家知识转移生成高质量的立体数据集，并用于微调立体模型。

Result: 3DGS生成的数据集在零样本泛化基准测试中表现优异，但直接使用重建几何会引入噪声；FoundationStereo的视差估计更干净，性能更好。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了低成本、高保真数据集生成的潜力，并指出3DGS方法在复杂场景中的鲁棒性仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for
stereo dataset generation, offering an efficient alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF)-based methods. To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore
utilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as
well as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge
transfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated
datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization
benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it
is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained
model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo
are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot
generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost,
high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models.
Moreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods
have achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness
falls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产数字化需求广泛，但单一方法不适用于所有对象，需结合遗产与数字领域专家的协作选择最佳工具。

Method: 通过法国国家考古博物馆的藏品案例，分析不同3D数字化方法的适用性，强调工具需根据对象特性调整。

Result: 研究发现，没有一种方法适用于所有对象，需根据具体需求和对象特性选择或调整工具。

Conclusion: 文化遗产数字化应避免绝对分类，而是针对每个对象选择最适合的工具，考虑其特性及未来用途。

Abstract: The need to digitize heritage objects is now widely accepted. This article
presents the very fashionable context of the creation of ''digital twins''. It
illustrates the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods, but this is
not its only objective. Using a selection of objects from the collections of
the mus{\'e}e d'Arch{\'e}ologie nationale, it shows that no single method is
suitable for all cases. Rather, the method to be recommended for a given object
should be the result of a concerted choice between those involved in heritage
and those involved in the digital domain, as each new object may require the
adaptation of existing tools. It would therefore be pointless to attempt an
absolute classification of 3D digitization methods. On the contrary, we need to
find the digital tool best suited to each object, taking into account not only
its characteristics, but also the future use of its digital twin.

annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and
covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two
geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians.
To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation
protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware
closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking
state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just
individual animal re-identification.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently shown promise in automated embryo
selection for In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). However, current approaches either
address partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target
clinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both
limiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called
Video-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes
full-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists'
overall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world
clinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a
grading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical
decision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern
Mining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists'
evaluation process. The CoSTeM comprises two branches: (1) a morphological
branch using a Mixture of Cross-Attentive Experts layer and a Temporal
Selection Block to select discriminative local structural features, and (2) a
morphokinetic branch employing a Temporal Transformer to model global
developmental trajectories, synergistically integrating static and dynamic
determinants for grading embryos. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
the superiority of our design. This work provides a valuable methodological
framework for AI-assisted embryo selection. The dataset and source code will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的方法，通过设计网络架构而非数据驱动的方式来提升图像质量评估（IQA）模型的鲁棒性，使其能够抵御对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据驱动防御方法（如对抗训练）存在局限性，论文探讨了是否可以通过设计模型架构本身来提升鲁棒性。

Method: 通过强制正交信息流和规范保持操作来重塑模型内部结构，并结合剪枝和微调进一步稳定系统。

Result: 提出了一种鲁棒的IQA架构，无需对抗训练即可抵御攻击，且对原始模型改动较小。

Conclusion: 论文主张从数据优化转向设计优化，为提升模型鲁棒性提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频多模态大语言模型因计算限制和低效信息提取难以处理小时级视频。

Method: APVR采用双组件方法：Pivot Frame Retrieval（语义扩展和多模态置信度评分）和Pivot Token Retrieval（查询感知的注意力驱动令牌选择）。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和VideoMME上取得显著性能提升，优于训练和无训练方法。

Conclusion: APVR为长视频理解提供了高效、即插即用的解决方案，性能优越。

Abstract: Current video-based multimodal large language models struggle with hour-level
video understanding due to computational constraints and inefficient
information extraction from extensive temporal sequences. We propose APVR
(Adaptive Pivot Visual information Retrieval), a training-free framework that
addresses the memory wall limitation through hierarchical visual information
retrieval. APVR operates via two complementary components: Pivot Frame
Retrieval employs semantic expansion and multi-modal confidence scoring to
identify semantically relevant video frames, while Pivot Token Retrieval
performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within the pivot frames.
This dual granularity approach enables processing of hour-long videos while
maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validation on LongVideoBench and
VideoMME demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing
state-of-the-art results for not only training-free but also training-based
approaches while providing plug-and-play integration capability with existing
MLLM architectures.

Motivation: 动态医学视频合成需要同时建模空间一致性和时间动态性，现有Transformer方法存在通道交互不足、计算复杂度高和去噪指导粗糙等问题。

Method: FEAT提出三种创新：1）统一的空间-时间-通道注意力机制；2）线性复杂度的注意力设计；3）残差值引导模块。

Result: FEAT-S参数仅为Endora的23%，性能相当或更优；FEAT-L在多个数据集上超越所有对比方法。

Conclusion: FEAT在动态医学视频合成中表现出高效性和可扩展性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality dynamic medical videos remains a significant
challenge due to the need for modeling both spatial consistency and temporal
dynamics. Existing Transformer-based approaches face critical limitations,
including insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity from
self-attention, and coarse denoising guidance from timestep embeddings when
handling varying noise levels. In this work, we propose FEAT, a
full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, which addresses these issues
through three key innovations: (1) a unified paradigm with sequential
spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies
across all dimensions, (2) a linear-complexity design for attention mechanisms
in each dimension, utilizing weighted key-value attention and global channel
attention, and (3) a residual value guidance module that provides fine-grained
pixel-level guidance to adapt to different noise levels. We evaluate FEAT on
standard benchmarks and downstream tasks, demonstrating that FEAT-S, with only
23\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art model Endora, achieves
comparable or even superior performance. Furthermore, FEAT-L surpasses all
comparison methods across multiple datasets, showcasing both superior
effectiveness and scalability. Code is available at

Result: SAM直接应用效果不如定制Mask R-CNN，但端到端调优和DSM集成显示出潜力。

Conclusion: SAM结合DSM数据是树冠分割的有前景方向，尤其在人工林场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Information on trees at the individual level is crucial for monitoring forest
ecosystems and planning forest management. Current monitoring methods involve
ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in
drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping
individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision
models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly
compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods
leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in
high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2)
temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of
elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM)
information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone
imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which
shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations.
We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask
R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM
end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree
crown instance segmentation models.

Result: TextVidBench对现有模型提出显著挑战，提出的方法在多个公开数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: TextVidBench为长视频文本理解提供了新基准，提出的方法为改进长视频场景文本理解能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Despite recent progress on the short-video Text-Visual Question Answering
(ViteVQA) task - largely driven by benchmarks such as M4-ViteVQA - existing
datasets still suffer from limited video duration and narrow evaluation scopes,
making it difficult to adequately assess the growing capabilities of powerful
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address these limitations, we
introduce TextVidBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for
long-video text question answering (>3 minutes). TextVidBench makes three key
contributions: 1) Cross-domain long-video coverage: Spanning 9 categories
(e.g., news, sports, gaming), with an average video length of 2306 seconds,
enabling more realistic evaluation of long-video understanding. 2) A
three-stage evaluation framework: "Text Needle-in-Haystack -> Temporal
Grounding -> Text Dynamics Captioning". 3) High-quality fine-grained
annotations: Containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs with detailed semantic
labeling. Furthermore, we propose an efficient paradigm for improving large
models through: (i) introducing the IT-Rope mechanism and temporal prompt
engineering to enhance temporal perception, (ii) adopting non-uniform
positional encoding to better handle long video sequences, and (iii) applying
lightweight fine-tuning on video-text data. Extensive experiments on multiple
public datasets as well as TextVidBench demonstrate that our new benchmark
presents significant challenges to existing models, while our proposed method
offers valuable insights into improving long-video scene text understanding
capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视觉自回归（VAR）模型的图像超分辨率（ISR）方法，通过分层图像标记化和直接偏好优化（DPO）解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了单次前向传递的超分辨率，并在小模型和无外部数据的情况下达到了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VARSR方法存在固定分辨率限制、依赖大规模模型和数据集的问题，本文旨在通过创新组件解决这些问题。

Method: 提出分层图像标记化（多尺度标记器）和DPO正则化项，训练VAR模型以在不同尺度上生成语义一致的残差。

Result: 模型能够在单次前向传递中完成去噪和超分辨率任务，使用小模型（300M参数）且无需外部数据，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 本文的创新方法显著提升了VAR在ISR任务中的效率和性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper we tackle Image Super Resolution (ISR), using recent advances
in Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling. VAR iteratively estimates the
residual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process
referred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during
pre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only
VARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However,
due to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a
fixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the
corresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer
architecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve
state-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel
components: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale
image tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while
simultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the
LR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over
the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is
trained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the
first time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR. Using
these two components, our model can denoise the LR image and super-resolve at
half and full target upscale factors in a single forward pass. Additionally, we
achieve \textit{state-of-the-art results on ISR}, while using a small model
(300M params vs ~1B params of VARSR), and without using external training data.

TL;DR: PATS是一种新颖的视频采样策略，通过保留完整的基础动作片段来提升运动技能评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频采样方法破坏了运动技能评估所需的时间连续性，限制了评估效果。

Method: 提出PATS策略，自适应分割视频以确保每个分析片段包含完整的关键动作执行，并在多视点配置下评估。

Result: 在EgoExo4D基准测试中，PATS在所有视点配置下均优于现有方法，并在多个领域取得显著提升。

Conclusion: PATS作为一种自适应时间采样方法，有效提升了自动化技能评估的实用性。

Abstract: Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement
patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video
sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency
evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling
(PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements
within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS
adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full
execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across
multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal
coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses
the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to
+3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22%
bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that
PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from
high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for
sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to
temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个针对中文场景文本检索的新模型CSTR-CLIP，通过结合全局视觉信息和多粒度对齐训练，显著提升了性能。同时，建立了一个多样化布局的基准数据集DL-CSVTR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理中文场景文本检索时表现不佳，主要因为中文文本布局复杂多样，而现有解决方案多基于英文场景设计。

Method: 提出CSTR-CLIP模型，采用两阶段训练过程，结合全局视觉信息和多粒度对齐训练，以处理多样化的文本布局。

Result: 在现有基准测试中，CSTR-CLIP比之前最优模型准确率提升18.82%，推理速度更快。在DL-CSVTR数据集上也表现出色。

Conclusion: CSTR-CLIP在中文场景文本检索任务中表现优异，DL-CSVTR数据集为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Chinese scene text retrieval is a practical task that aims to search for
images containing visual instances of a Chinese query text. This task is
extremely challenging because Chinese text often features complex and diverse
layouts in real-world scenes. Current efforts tend to inherit the solution for
English scene text retrieval, failing to achieve satisfactory performance. In
this paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View
Text Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval
performance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and
partial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose
Chinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates
global visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP
applies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as
the exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on
single-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle
diverse text layouts. Experiments on existing benchmark show that CSTR-CLIP
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% accuracy and also
provides faster inference speed. Further analysis on DL-CSVTR confirms the
superior performance of CSTR-CLIP in handling various text layouts. The dataset
and code will be publicly available to facilitate research in Chinese scene
text retrieval.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了单目深度估计的进展，重点介绍了深度学习在该领域的应用及其挑战，尤其是泛化到未见域的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目深度估计的目标是从RGB图像中预测每个像素的深度。尽管深度学习推动了该领域的发展，但泛化到未见域仍是一个挑战。

Method: 研究采用了多尺度融合网络、将回归任务重新定义为分类问题、引入额外先验以及开发更有效的目标函数等方法。

Result: Depth Anything在零样本单目深度估计中表现领先，能够从未见图像中提取结构信息，生成结构详细的深度图。

Conclusion: 尽管在未见域的泛化上仍有挑战，但Depth Anything展示了在结构信息提取方面的优势。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to determine the depth of each pixel from an
RGB image captured by a monocular camera. The development of deep learning has
significantly advanced this field by facilitating the learning of depth
features from some well-annotated datasets
\cite{Geiger_Lenz_Stiller_Urtasun_2013,silberman2012indoor}. Eigen \textit{et
al.} \cite{eigen2014depth} first introduce a multi-scale fusion network for
depth regression. Following this, subsequent improvements have come from
reinterpreting the regression task as a classification problem
\cite{bhat2021adabins,Li_Wang_Liu_Jiang_2022}, incorporating additional priors
\cite{shao2023nddepth,yang2023gedepth}, and developing more effective objective
function \cite{xian2020structure,Yin_Liu_Shen_Yan_2019}. Despite these
advances, generalizing to unseen domains remains a challenge. Recently, several
methods have employed affine-invariant loss to enable multi-dataset joint
training \cite{MiDaS,ZeroDepth,guizilini2023towards,Dany}. Among them, Depth
Anything \cite{Dany} has shown leading performance in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. While it struggles to estimate accurate metric depth due to the
lack of explicit depth cues, it excels at extracting structural information
from unseen images, producing structure-detailed monocular depth.

Motivation: 真实点云数据获取和标注成本高，需要替代方案。

Method: 结合3D高斯泼溅和透明度场生成农业车辆3D资产，模拟LiDAR生成点云数据。

Result: 仅用合成数据训练的模型（如PTv3）mIoU达91.35%，部分场景优于真实数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 合成数据可有效替代真实数据，且模型能泛化到未训练的语义类别。

Abstract: Training neural networks for tasks such as 3D point cloud semantic
segmentation demands extensive datasets, yet obtaining and annotating
real-world point clouds is costly and labor-intensive. This work aims to
introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by
leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to
generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using
generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the
point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach
that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional
costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as
PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the
models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of
91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor
validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain
scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed
better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments
demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling
accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态神经渲染方法未能解决无人机拍摄场景的独特挑战，如单目相机设置、俯视角和多小移动人体等问题。

Method: 结合3D基础模型和人体网格重建模型，提出解决场景尺度模糊的新方法，利用SMPL模型和背景网格初始化高斯样条。

Result: 在三个复杂无人机数据集上测试，PSNR提升1.5 dB，视觉清晰度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UAV4D框架在无人机动态场景渲染中表现优异，为单目视频数据提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in dynamic neural rendering, existing
methods fail to address the unique challenges posed by UAV-captured scenarios,
particularly those involving monocular camera setups, top-down perspective, and
multiple small, moving humans, which are not adequately represented in existing
datasets. In this work, we introduce UAV4D, a framework for enabling
photorealistic rendering for dynamic real-world scenes captured by UAVs.
Specifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with
multiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for
additional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human
mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans.
We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both
humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact
points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to
initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our
method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and
Okutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans. Our
results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing methods in novel
view synthesis, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual
sharpness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统屏幕标注方法效率低且不够直观，无法充分利用检测人员的专业知识。本文旨在通过物理交互方式优化数据标注流程。

Method: 系统使用校准的追踪指针记录用户输入，并结合投影界面提供视觉引导，将物理轨迹转化为标准标注格式。

Result: 初步评估证实系统能高效捕获详细标注轨迹，并与CVAT集成优化后续ML任务工作流。

Conclusion: 该系统填补了人机交互与自动化数据生成之间的鸿沟，为非IT专家参与ML训练提供了可能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel physical annotation system designed to generate
training data for automated optical inspection. The system uses pointer-based
in-situ interaction to transfer the valuable expertise of trained inspection
personnel directly into a machine learning (ML) training pipeline. Unlike
conventional screen-based annotation methods, our system captures physical
trajectories and contours directly on the object, providing a more intuitive
and efficient way to label data. The core technology uses calibrated, tracked
pointers to accurately record user input and transform these spatial
interactions into standardised annotation formats that are compatible with
open-source annotation software. Additionally, a simple projector-based
interface projects visual guidance onto the object to assist users during the
annotation process, ensuring greater accuracy and consistency. The proposed
concept bridges the gap between human expertise and automated data generation,
enabling non-IT experts to contribute to the ML training pipeline and
preventing the loss of valuable training samples. Preliminary evaluation
results confirm the feasibility of capturing detailed annotation trajectories
and demonstrate that integration with CVAT streamlines the workflow for
subsequent ML tasks. This paper details the system architecture, calibration
procedures and interface design, and discusses its potential contribution to
future ML data generation for automated optical inspection.

TL;DR: FlowDirector提出了一种无需反转的视频编辑框架，通过ODE在数据空间中直接演化视频，保持时间一致性和结构细节，并通过注意力掩码和增强引导策略实现局部可控编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于反转的视频编辑方法导致的时间不一致和结构退化问题。

Method: 使用ODE在数据空间中直接演化视频，引入注意力掩码机制和增强引导策略。

Result: 在指令遵循、时间一致性和背景保留方面达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: FlowDirector为高效且连贯的视频编辑提供了新范式。

Abstract: Text-driven video editing aims to modify video content according to natural
language instructions. While recent training-free approaches have made progress
by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on
inversion-based techniques that map input videos into the latent space, which
often leads to temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity. To
address this, we propose FlowDirector, a novel inversion-free video editing
framework. Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in
data space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to
smoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby
preserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and
controllable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that
modulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially
and temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic
alignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing
strategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential
signals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward
stronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves
state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency,
and background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and
coherent video editing without inversion.

Abstract: Vietnamese document analysis and recognition (DAR) is a crucial field with
applications in digitization, information retrieval, and automation. Despite
advancements in OCR and NLP, Vietnamese text recognition faces unique
challenges due to its complex diacritics, tonal variations, and lack of
large-scale annotated datasets. Traditional OCR methods often struggle with
real-world document variations, while deep learning approaches have shown
promise but remain limited by data scarcity and generalization issues.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models have
demonstrated remarkable improvements in text recognition and document
understanding, offering a new direction for Vietnamese DAR. However, challenges
such as domain adaptation, multimodal learning, and computational efficiency
persist. This survey provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques in
Vietnamese document recognition, highlights key limitations, and explores how
LLMs can revolutionize the field. We discuss future research directions,
including dataset development, model optimization, and the integration of
multimodal approaches for improved document intelligence. By addressing these
gaps, we aim to foster advancements in Vietnamese DAR and encourage

present several key improvements. First, we develop an enhanced data curation
pipeline with a meta-info paradigm and meta-info embedding strategy that help
mix images from multiple data sources. This allows us to scale editing data
effectively, and meta information is helpfult to connect VLM with diffusion
model more closely. Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for
computing a diffusion loss and a reward loss. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0
on our testing benchmarks, for real image editing, where it achieves a best
trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%,

Motivation: 传统的街道指标无法充分捕捉主观感知，而主观感知对包容性城市设计至关重要。

Method: MSEF结合了视觉变换器（VisualGLM-6B）和大型语言模型（GPT-4），使用LoRA和P-Tuning v2进行参数高效微调。

Result: 模型在客观特征上F1得分为0.84，与居民感知的一致性达到89.3%，并揭示了情境依赖的矛盾和非线性模式。

Conclusion: MSEF为城市感知建模提供了方法创新，并为规划系统提供了实用工具，以协调基础设施精确性与生活体验。

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

Motivation: 现有的视频扩散变压器计算需求高，现有加速方法依赖启发式规则，适用性有限。

Method: 提出轻量级令牌选择机制和GPU并行稀疏注意力策略，结合进化算法自动优化令牌预算分配。

Result: 在单GPU上实现2.4倍推理加速（8GPU可达13.2倍），视频质量损失极小（VBench得分损失<0.5%）。

Conclusion: ASTRAEA在保持高质量的同时显著提升了vDiT的推理效率，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made impressive progress in
text-to-video generation, but their high computational demands present major
challenges for practical deployment. While existing acceleration methods reduce
workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting
their applicability.
  We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal
configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a
lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel
sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with
minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for
different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a
classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of
the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference
speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs)
while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods
(<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).

quality and consistency. However, this has come at the cost of representation
diversity. While automatic evaluation methods exist for benchmarking model
diversity, they either require reference image datasets or lack specificity
about the kind of diversity measured, limiting their adaptability and
interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it
framework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity
("Does" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization
capacity ("Can" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular
concept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO
concepts and captions and augmented by a large language model. With
COCO-DIMCIM, we find that widely-used models improve in generalization at the
cost of default-mode diversity when scaling from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters.
DIMCIM also identifies fine-grained failure cases, such as attributes that are
generated with generic prompts but are rarely generated when explicitly
requested. Finally, we use DIMCIM to evaluate the training data of a T2I model
and observe a correlation of 0.85 between diversity in training images and
default-mode diversity. Our work provides a flexible and interpretable
framework for assessing T2I model diversity and generalization, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of model performance.

*Benedikt Hopf,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种实用篡改模型（PMM），通过扩展伪伪造空间和增强训练图像的退化，显著提升了深度伪造检测模型的鲁棒性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测模型在非理想条件下表现不稳定，容易被规避，因此需要一种更全面的伪造模型来提升检测器的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用Poisson混合、多样化掩码、生成器伪影和干扰物扩展伪伪造空间，并在训练图像中添加强退化以增强检测器的泛化能力。

Result: 在DFDC和DFDCP数据集上，AUC分别提高了3.51%和6.21%，显著提升了模型对常见图像退化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PMM不仅提升了检测性能，还揭示了以往检测器在鲁棒性方面的不足，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern deepfake detection models have achieved strong performance even on the
challenging cross-dataset task. However, detection performance under non-ideal
conditions remains very unstable, limiting success on some benchmark datasets
and making it easy to circumvent detection. Inspired by the move to a more
real-world degradation model in the area of image super-resolution, we have
developed a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) that covers a larger set of
possible forgeries. We extend the space of pseudo-fakes by using Poisson
blending, more diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors.
Additionally, we improve the detectors' generality and robustness by adding
strong degradations to the training images. We demonstrate that these changes
not only significantly enhance the model's robustness to common image
degradations but also improve performance on standard benchmark datasets.
Specifically, we show clear increases of $3.51\%$ and $6.21\%$ AUC on the DFDC
and DFDCP datasets, respectively, over the s-o-t-a LAA backbone. Furthermore,
we highlight the lack of robustness in previous detectors and our improvements
in this regard. Code can be found at https://github.com/BenediktHopf/PMM

TL;DR: CIVET框架用于系统评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）对场景结构和语义的理解能力，发现当前VLMs在对象属性、位置和关系理解上存在局限，且未达到人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs对场景结构和语义的理解能力，填补标准化系统评估的空白。

Method: 提出CIVET框架，通过可控刺激对五种先进VLMs进行系统评估，避免噪声和偏差。

Result: VLMs仅能识别有限基本属性，性能受对象位置影响，且难以理解对象关系，未达到人类水平。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在场景理解上仍有不足，需进一步改进以实现更全面的语义理解。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

Motivation: 传统RGB相机在捕捉高速移动的无人机时存在局限性，尤其是在复杂光照条件下。事件相机具有高时间分辨率和动态范围，但现有基准数据集缺乏精细时间分辨率或无人机特定运动模式。

Method: 作者提出了FRED数据集，包含7小时密集标注的无人机轨迹，涵盖5种无人机模型及挑战性场景（如雨天和不良光照），并提供评估协议和标准指标。

Result: FRED数据集为无人机检测、跟踪和轨迹预测提供了多模态数据支持，填补了现有基准的不足。

Abstract: Small, fast, and lightweight drones present significant challenges for
traditional RGB cameras due to their limitations in capturing fast-moving
objects, especially under challenging lighting conditions. Event cameras offer
an ideal solution, providing high temporal definition and dynamic range, yet
existing benchmarks often lack fine temporal resolution or drone-specific
motion patterns, hindering progress in these areas. This paper introduces the
Florence RGB-Event Drone dataset (FRED), a novel multimodal dataset
specifically designed for drone detection, tracking, and trajectory
forecasting, combining RGB video and event streams. FRED features more than 7
hours of densely annotated drone trajectories, using 5 different drone models
and including challenging scenarios such as rain and adverse lighting
conditions. We provide detailed evaluation protocols and standard metrics for
each task, facilitating reproducible benchmarking. The authors hope FRED will
advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal
understanding.

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在不使用神经网络的情况下，仍能实现高效的TWR HAR任务，并具有物理可解释性。

Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR)
human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the
mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The
earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require
a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods
possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of
theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to
return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve
the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural
network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are
first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and
noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and
the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour
model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a
two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the
resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated
using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured
experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at:

TL;DR: TAO是一种新的视频异常检测框架，通过像素级跟踪异常对象，统一检测多粒度异常，无需阈值调整，提高了准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注异常帧或对象，缺乏对像素级异常的细粒度分析，限制了检测范围。

Method: 提出TAO框架，将异常检测转化为像素级跟踪问题，结合分割和跟踪任务，避免阈值调整。

Result: 实验表明TAO在准确性和鲁棒性上达到新标杆。

Conclusion: TAO为视频异常检测提供了更精确的定位和更广的检测范围。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is
essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting
anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or
objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels,
which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address
this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object
(TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for
the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous
objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to
every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of
anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as
segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and
achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences.
Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and
robustness. Project page available online.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TAPFM的新方法，用于在单GPU上对病理基础模型（PFMs）进行任务适配，通过视觉变换器（ViT）注意力机制优化多实例学习（MIL）聚合，显著提升了临床任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管病理基础模型（PFMs）在分析全切片图像（WSIs）方面表现出色，但由于仅能获得弱标签（WSI级别）且需要多实例学习（MIL），其在实际临床任务中的适配仍面临挑战。

Method: TAPFM采用视觉变换器（ViT）注意力机制进行MIL聚合，同时优化特征表示和注意力权重，并通过分离MIL聚合器和PFM的计算图以稳定训练动态。

Result: 在膀胱癌和肺腺癌的突变预测任务中，TAPFM在多个数据集上均优于传统方法，尤其在多标签分类任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: TAPFM使得在标准硬件上高效适配预训练PFMs成为可能，为多种临床应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs
for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to
the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images,
necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI
analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask
\textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer
(\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature
representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate
computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training
dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end
adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung
adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently
outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the
benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable
mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs
practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态低秩适配方法（MokA），针对当前多模态微调方法的局限性，通过模态特定参数压缩单模态信息并增强跨模态交互，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的微调效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高效多模态微调方法大多直接借鉴自大语言模型，忽视了多模态场景的固有差异，导致无法充分利用所有模态。

Method: 提出MokA方法，结合单模态适配和跨模态适配，通过模态特定参数压缩单模态信息并显式增强跨模态交互。

Result: 在多种多模态场景（如视听文本、视觉文本、语音文本）和不同大语言模型上实验，均取得一致改进。

Conclusion: MokA为多模态大语言模型的高效适配提供了更针对性的解决方案，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we reveal that most current efficient multimodal fine-tuning
methods are hindered by a key limitation: they are directly borrowed from LLMs,
often neglecting the intrinsic differences of multimodal scenarios and even
affecting the full utilization of all modalities. Inspired by our empirical
observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are
two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this
perspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a
multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal
characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by
modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal
interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive
experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text,
visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2,
Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility
of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also
conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more
targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further
exploration. The project page is at https://gewu-lab.github.io/MokA.

Conclusion: 该系统展示了在复杂动态环境中实现弹性和自适应毫米波连接的潜力。

Abstract: Reliable millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
conditions remains a major challenge for both military and civilian operations,
especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments. This paper presents
a vision-aided autonomous reflector system designed to enhance mmWave link
performance by dynamically steering signal reflections using a motorized
metallic plate. The proposed system leverages a monocular camera to detect
ArUco markers on allied transmitter and receiver nodes, estimate their angles
of arrival, and align the reflector in real time for optimal signal
redirection. This approach enables selective beam coverage by serving only
authenticated targets with visible markers and reduces the risk of unintended
signal exposure. The designed prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi 4 and
low-power hardware, operates autonomously without reliance on external
infrastructure or GPS. Experimental results at 60\,GHz demonstrate a 23\,dB
average gain in received signal strength and an 0.89 probability of maintaining
signal reception above a target threshold of -65 dB in an indoor environment,
far exceeding the static and no-reflector baselines. These results demonstrate
the system's potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in
complex and dynamic environments.

Conclusion: 提出基线方法以减少跨模态转移差距，并希望促进更稳健的多模态学习技术研究。

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

Motivation: 探究3D目标定位是否真正受益于检测任务，发现现有方法存在不足，从而提出改进方案。

Method: 提出DEGround框架，共享DETR查询用于检测与定位，并引入区域激活模块和查询调制模块以增强语言理解。

Result: DEGround在EmbodiedScan验证集上的整体准确率比当前最优模型BIP3D高出7.52%。

Conclusion: DEGround通过结合检测与定位任务，显著提升了3D定位性能，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Embodied 3D grounding aims to localize target objects described in human
instructions from ego-centric viewpoint. Most methods typically follow a
two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters
are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a
fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection?
To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection
models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly,
these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the
grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates
that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let
alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we
propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both
DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic
category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further
introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights
instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that
incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation,
strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions.
Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52\% at
overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/zyn213/DEGround.

Result: 在Gaussian Outpainting基准测试中表现优异，支持智能手机拍摄的两视图输入。

Conclusion: OGGSplat在稀疏视图下实现了语义一致且视觉合理的3D场景重建，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging
yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging
applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene
optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational
costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions
outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open
Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D
reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open
Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic
consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are
initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent
inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces
bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion
model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient
and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we
establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and
generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also
demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when
provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Motion框架显著提升了运动迁移的效率和一致性，为视频生成领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown
remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the
motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations
(LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing
adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and
tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive
two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between
generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the
3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning
processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose
Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that
finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex
motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple
the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion
processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion
sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack
of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive
benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single
object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show
extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of
Follow-Your-Motion.

Conclusion: DSG-World为真实世界的3D重建和模拟提供了一种高效且物理一致的方法。

Abstract: Building an efficient and physically consistent world model from limited
observations is a long standing challenge in vision and robotics. Many existing
world modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are
hard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand,
explicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage
processing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to
occlusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same
scene under different object configurations. These dual states offer
complementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions
and enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present
DSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D
Gaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual
segmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and
semantic consistency. We further introduce a pseudo intermediate state for
symmetric alignment and design collaborative co-pruning trategies to refine

TL;DR: MonkeyOCR是一种基于SRR三元范式的视觉语言模型，用于文档解析，通过简化复杂流程并提升效率，在准确性和速度上取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文档解析方法中复杂多工具流程和低效全页处理的不足。

Method: 采用Structure-Recognition-Relation (SRR) 三元范式，将文档解析分解为结构、识别和关系三个问题。

Result: 在MonkeyDoc数据集上，MonkeyOCR平均性能优于MinerU 5.1%，尤其在公式和表格处理上表现突出，且速度更快。

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR在文档解析任务中实现了高效、精确的SOTA性能，适合实际部署。

Abstract: We introduce MonkeyOCR, a vision-language model for document parsing that
advances the state of the art by leveraging a Structure-Recognition-Relation
(SRR) triplet paradigm. This design simplifies what would otherwise be a
complex multi-tool pipeline (as in MinerU's modular approach) and avoids the
inefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models (e.g.,
large multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL). In SRR, document parsing is abstracted
into three fundamental questions - "Where is it?" (structure), "What is it?"
(recognition), and "How is it organized?" (relation) - corresponding to layout
analysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused
decomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable
processing without sacrificing precision. To train and evaluate this approach,
we introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to
date), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both
Chinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an
average of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content
such as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter
model surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL
(72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on
English document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page
documents significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for
MinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The 3B model can be efficiently deployed
for inference on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code and models will be released at
https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/MonkeyOCR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SAM-TTA方法，通过测试时适配提升SAM在医学图像分割中的性能，同时保持其泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAM在医学图像分割中适应性不足的问题，同时避免现有方法（如MedSAM）泛化能力下降的缺点。

Method: 1. SBCT：自适应转换单通道医学图像为三通道输入；2. DUMT：通过一致性学习对齐SAM内部表示与医学语义。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上表现优于现有TTA方法，甚至在某些情况下超越完全微调模型（如MedSAM）。

Conclusion: SAM-TTA为通用医学图像分割提供了新范式，代码已开源。

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains.
Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical
imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a
fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while
improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time
framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies
caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images
and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object
definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs.
ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1)
Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively
converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs
while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between
medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher
adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal
representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without
auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five
public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA
approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain
scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image
segmentation. Code can be found at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SAM-TTA.

TL;DR: MoViX是一种自监督的跨视角视频定位框架，用于GPS缺失的越野环境，通过学习视角和季节不变的表示实现鲁棒定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GPS缺失环境下因重复植被、非结构化地形和季节变化导致的定位挑战。

Method: 采用姿态依赖的正采样策略、时间对齐的硬负采样、运动信息帧采样器和轻量级时间聚合器。

Result: 在TartanDrive 2.0数据集上，MoViX在93%的情况下定位误差小于25米，100%小于50米，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoViX在未针对特定环境调整的情况下表现出色，并能在不同地理区域和机器人平台上泛化。

Abstract: Robust cross-view 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments
remains challenging due to (1) perceptual ambiguities from repetitive
vegetation and unstructured terrain, and (2) seasonal shifts that significantly
alter scene appearance, hindering alignment with outdated satellite imagery. To
address this, we introduce MoViX, a self-supervised cross-view video
localization framework that learns viewpoint- and season-invariant
representations while preserving directional awareness essential for accurate
localization. MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to
enhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining
to discourage shortcut learning from seasonal cues. A motion-informed frame
sampler selects spatially diverse frames, and a lightweight temporal aggregator
emphasizes geometrically aligned observations while downweighting ambiguous
ones. At inference, MoViX runs within a Monte Carlo Localization framework,
using a learned cross-view matching module in place of handcrafted models.
Entropy-guided temperature scaling enables robust multi-hypothesis tracking and
confident convergence under visual ambiguity. We evaluate MoViX on the
TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, training on under 30 minutes of data and testing over
12.29 km. Despite outdated satellite imagery, MoViX localizes within 25 meters
of ground truth 93% of the time, and within 50 meters 100% of the time in
unseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without
environment-specific tuning. We further demonstrate generalization on a
real-world off-road dataset from a geographically distinct site with a
different robot platform.

TL;DR: 论文提出LeanPO方法，解决Video-LLMs中偏好对齐技术导致的非目标响应概率提升问题，通过重新定义奖励和动态标签平滑策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Video-LLMs使用偏好对齐技术（如DPO）时，观察到目标响应和非目标响应的对数概率均下降，导致非目标响应概率意外提升，尤其在视频内容冗余时更严重。

Method: 提出LeanPO，一种无参考方法，将隐式奖励重新定义为响应相对于策略模型的平均似然，并结合自生成偏好数据管道和动态标签平滑策略。

Result: 实验表明LeanPO显著提升Video-LLMs性能，且额外训练开销小，同时增强与人类可信度的对齐。

Conclusion: LeanPO为Video-LLMs提供了一种简单有效的偏好对齐解决方案，推动可靠高效Video-LLMs的发展。

Abstract: Most Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) adopt preference alignment
techniques, e.g., DPO~\citep{rafailov2024dpo}, to optimize the reward margin
between a winning response ($y_w$) and a losing response ($y_l$). However, the
likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta
(y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training,
inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this
paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs,
showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video
content. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \emph{Lean
Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates
the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to
the policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness
correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses
relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the
preference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain
high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus
mitigating the unintended drop. In addition, we introduce a dynamic label
smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse
video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the
performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of
varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead. Moreover, LeanPO
offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with
human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient
Video-LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何利用基础模型（FM）提升身份证展示攻击检测（PAD）的泛化能力，特别是在面对不同国家身份证时的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PAD系统因隐私保护问题通常仅针对少数几种身份证训练，导致在未知国家的身份证上表现不佳。FM因其在大规模数据集上的训练能力，有望提升泛化性能。

Method: 研究采用了零样本学习和微调两种方法，并在两个数据集（智利ID私有数据集和芬兰、西班牙、斯洛伐克的公开数据集）上进行测试。

Result: 研究发现，真实图像（bona fide images）是提升泛化能力的关键。

Conclusion: 基础模型在提升PAD系统泛化能力方面具有潜力，尤其是在处理多国身份证时。

Abstract: Nowadays, one of the main challenges in presentation attack detection (PAD)
on ID cards is obtaining generalisation capabilities for a diversity of
countries that are issuing ID cards. Most PAD systems are trained on one, two,
or three ID documents because of privacy protection concerns. As a result, they
do not obtain competitive results for commercial purposes when tested in an
unknown new ID card country. In this scenario, Foundation Models (FM) trained
on huge datasets can help to improve generalisation capabilities. This work
intends to improve and benchmark the capabilities of FM and how to use them to
adapt the generalisation on PAD of ID Documents. Different test protocols were
used, considering zero-shot and fine-tuning and two different ID card datasets.
One private dataset based on Chilean IDs and one open-set based on three ID
countries: Finland, Spain, and Slovakia. Our findings indicate that bona fide
images are the key to generalisation.

TL;DR: TF-CoVR是一个专注于时间细粒度视频检索的新基准，通过大语言模型生成查询-修改对，并提出了一个两阶段训练框架TF-CoVR-Base，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频检索基准未能充分测试对快速、细微时间差异的捕捉能力，因此需要一个新的基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出TF-CoVR基准，使用大语言模型生成查询-修改对，并设计TF-CoVR-Base框架，包括预训练视频编码器和对比学习对齐查询与候选视频。

Result: TF-CoVR-Base在零样本和微调设置下均显著提升了检索性能，mAP@50分别从5.92提升到7.51和从19.83提升到25.82。

Conclusion: TF-CoVR为时间细粒度视频检索提供了首个大规模基准，TF-CoVR-Base框架展示了显著性能提升，为实际应用如体育高光生成提供了支持。

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) retrieves a target video given a query video
and a modification text describing the intended change. Existing CoVR
benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do
not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We
introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally
fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K
triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing
on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the
same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct
each <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences
between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with
multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such
as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose
TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video
encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally
discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos
using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image,
video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained
composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR,
TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and
after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

Motivation: 现实场景中难以保证完美的光度一致性，现有方法（如外观编码和双边网格）存在局限性，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种多尺度双边网格，统一了外观编码和双边网格的优势，优化了像素级颜色映射。

Result: 在Waymo、NuScenes、Argoverse和PandaSet四个数据集上表现优异，几何精度显著提升，减少了光度不一致导致的伪影。

Conclusion: 多尺度双边网格方法在自动驾驶场景重建中表现出色，为障碍物避障和控制提供了更准确的几何信息。

Abstract: Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely
on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in
real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric
consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to
address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code
is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to
perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain
effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that
unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach
significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous
driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral
grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is
important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results
across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further
demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale
bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric
inconsistency.

Method: 通过自监督编码器学习连续点速度场，将噪声点传输到目标位置，恢复部件姿态，无需对称标签。

Result: 在六个基准测试中达到最新性能，统一框架支持联合训练，提升准确性。

Conclusion: Rectified Point Flow 提供了一种高效且统一的方法，显著提升了点云配准和形状组装的性能。

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

Motivation: 现有视频世界模型因时间上下文窗口有限，难以维持场景一致性，尤其是在重新访问时。受人类记忆机制启发，希望通过几何空间记忆提升长期一致性。

Method: 引入了一种基于几何空间的长时记忆框架，包括存储和检索机制，并使用定制数据集训练和评估带有显式3D记忆的模型。

Result: 评估显示，该方法在质量、一致性和上下文长度上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为长期一致的视频世界生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Emerging world models autoregressively generate video frames in response to
actions, such as camera movements and text prompts, among other control
signals. Due to limited temporal context window sizes, these models often
struggle to maintain scene consistency during revisits, leading to severe
forgetting of previously generated environments. Inspired by the mechanisms of
human memory, we introduce a novel framework to enhancing long-term consistency
of video world models through a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory. Our
framework includes mechanisms to store and retrieve information from the
long-term spatial memory and we curate custom datasets to train and evaluate
world models with explicitly stored 3D memory mechanisms. Our evaluations show
improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to relevant
baselines, paving the way towards long-term consistent world generation.

Motivation: 现有3D形状补全方法缺乏3D一致性、计算成本高且难以捕捉锐利边界，RaySt3R旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用单张RGB-D图像和多视角查询光线，训练Transformer预测深度图、物体掩码和置信度，并通过多视角融合完成3D重建。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，RaySt3R性能优于基线方法，3D chamfer距离提升高达44%。

Conclusion: RaySt3R通过新视角合成方法实现了高效、一致的3D形状补全，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: 3D shape completion has broad applications in robotics, digital twin
reconstruction, and extended reality (XR). Although recent advances in 3D
object and scene completion have achieved impressive results, existing methods
lack 3D consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle to capture
sharp object boundaries. Our work (RaySt3R) addresses these limitations by
recasting 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem. Specifically,
given a single RGB-D image and a novel viewpoint (encoded as a collection of
query rays), we train a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object
masks, and per-pixel confidence scores for those query rays. RaySt3R fuses
these predictions across multiple query views to reconstruct complete 3D
shapes. We evaluate RaySt3R on synthetic and real-world datasets, and observe
it achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baselines on all
datasets by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance. Project page:

Motivation: 医学领域对透明性的需求促使研究可解释AI（XAI），但现有方法仅依赖概念特征，忽略了医学图像的内在特征，且稳定性不足。

Method: 提出Vision Concept Transformer (VCT)和Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT)，结合视觉变换器（ViT）和概念层，融合概念特征与图像特征，并通过Denoised Diffusion Smoothing提升稳定性。

Result: 在四个医学数据集上的实验表明，VCT和SVCT在保持准确性的同时具有可解释性，SVCT在扰动下仍能提供稳定的解释。

Conclusion: VCT和SVCT满足了医学领域对透明性和稳定性的需求，为可解释AI提供了新方向。

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven
breakthroughs in egocentric vision applications. These applications necessitate
persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with

benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's
appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic
changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce
EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate
object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially,
EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three
temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained
evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough
assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework
with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy
metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct
comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level
MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object
cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for
developing reliable core models for embodied systems.

Motivation: 现有图像分词器在压缩过程中编码的双向依赖关系阻碍了自回归模型的有效建模。

Method: 使用因果解码器建立单向依赖关系，结合前缀标记和两阶段分词器训练以增强重建一致性。

Result: 在ImageNet-256基准测试中，AliTok在177M参数下gFID为1.50，IS为305.9；662M参数下gFID为1.35，采样速度比扩散方法快10倍。

Conclusion: AliTok在重建性能和生成效率上均优于现有方法，且代码和权重已开源。

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on
previous ones. However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with
bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the
effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel
Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish
unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token
modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore,
by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to
enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction
performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a
standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M
parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the
parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35,
surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling
speed. The code and weights are available at

computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based
approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration,
extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored,
particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In
this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2,
which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the
challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several
enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically,
an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is
dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window
inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a
predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training
towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses,
including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing
training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve
comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a
single step.

TL;DR: PAM是一个高效的区域级视觉理解框架，结合了SAM 2和LLMs，支持对象分割与语义输出生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升图像和视频中区域级视觉理解的全面性和效率。

Method: 通过Semantic Perceiver将SAM 2的视觉特征转化为多模态令牌，结合数据增强生成高质量数据集。

Result: PAM在多种任务中表现优异，运行速度更快且内存消耗更低。

Conclusion: PAM为区域级视觉理解提供了高效且实用的解决方案，可作为未来研究的基准。

Abstract: We present Perceive Anything Model (PAM), a conceptually straightforward and
efficient framework for comprehensive region-level visual understanding in
images and videos. Our approach extends the powerful segmentation model SAM 2
by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling simultaneous object
segmentation with the generation of diverse, region-specific semantic outputs,
including categories, label definition, functional explanations, and detailed
captions. A key component, Semantic Perceiver, is introduced to efficiently
transform SAM 2's rich visual features, which inherently carry general vision,
localization, and semantic priors into multi-modal tokens for LLM
comprehension. To support robust multi-granularity understanding, we also
develop a dedicated data refinement and augmentation pipeline, yielding a
high-quality dataset of 1.5M image and 0.6M video region-semantic annotations,
including novel region-level streaming video caption data. PAM is designed for
lightweightness and efficiency, while also demonstrates strong performance
across a diverse range of region understanding tasks. It runs 1.2-2.4x faster
and consumes less GPU memory than prior approaches, offering a practical
solution for real-world applications. We believe that our effective approach
will serve as a strong baseline for future research in region-level visual
understanding.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过3D感知伪标签改进语义匹配的方法，显著提升了性能，并在SPair-71k数据集上取得了新的最佳结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语义匹配中对称物体或重复部分导致的模糊性问题，同时减少对特定数据集标注的依赖。

Method: 训练适配器以优化现成特征，利用3D感知链式伪标签、松弛循环一致性和3D球形原型映射约束过滤错误标签。

Result: 在SPair-71k数据集上实现了超过4%的绝对性能提升，相比类似监督需求的方法提升了7%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通用性强，可轻松扩展到其他数据源，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and
object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While
large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective
priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric
objects or repeated object parts. We propose to improve semantic correspondence
estimation via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to
refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware
chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D
spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset
specific annotations compared to prior work, we set a new state-of-the-art on
SPair-71k by over 4% absolute gain and by over 7% against methods with similar
supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies
extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our
experiments.

Motivation: 改进基于示例的材料编辑方法，通过识别去噪UNet中负责材料属性的模块，实现更精确的材料控制。

Conclusion: MARBLE在材料编辑和细粒度属性控制方面表现出色，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Editing materials of objects in images based on exemplar images is an active
area of research in computer vision and graphics. We propose MARBLE, a method
for performing material blending and recomposing fine-grained material
properties by finding material embeddings in CLIP-space and using that to
control pre-trained text-to-image models. We improve exemplar-based material
editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material
attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the
CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric
control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic,
transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the
desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative
analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present
the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass
and applicability to painting.

Conclusion: ProJo4D通过渐进式联合优化，有效提升了物理基础的4D场景理解能力。

Abstract: Neural rendering has made significant strides in 3D reconstruction and novel
view synthesis. With the integration with physics, it opens up new
applications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data,
however, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications
like physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing
methods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically
require dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable,
real-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential
optimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error
accumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material
parameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization,
directly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the
highly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We
propose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually
increases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity,
leading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state,
and material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show
that ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view
rendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its
effectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding. For demos, please

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究3D VLMs在任务中表现不佳的原因，尤其是3D场景中心模型，以改进其性能。

Method: 分类3D VLMs为3D对象中心、2D图像基础和3D场景中心方法，分析性能差距并提出新数据集。

Result: 发现3D场景中心模型对3D编码器依赖有限，预训练效果差，且易过拟合语言线索。

Conclusion: 需改进评估策略和模型设计，以提升3D VLMs的3D场景理解能力。

Abstract: Remarkable progress in 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has spurred interest
in extending them to 3D settings for tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense
Captioning, and Visual Grounding. Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images
through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures,
allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this
paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D
scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D
scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively
lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based
approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing
that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and
the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we
observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our
investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment
capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent
answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D
encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene
understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset
designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our
findings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for
better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度图在3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）中被广泛用于生成3D点云以合成新视角，但物体边界处的深度不连续性会导致点云稀疏或碎片化，影响渲染质量。

Method: 引入PM-Loss，一种基于预训练变换器预测点图的正则化损失，通过几何平滑性约束改进深度图。

Result: 改进后的深度图显著提升了3DGS的渲染效果，适用于多种架构和场景。

Conclusion: PM-Loss有效解决了深度不连续性问题，提升了3DGS的渲染质量。

Abstract: Depth maps are widely used in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
pipelines by unprojecting them into 3D point clouds for novel view synthesis.
This approach offers advantages such as efficient training, the use of known
camera poses, and accurate geometry estimation. However, depth discontinuities
at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading
rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To
tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a
pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself
may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric
smoothness, especially around object boundaries. With the improved depth map,
our method significantly improves the feed-forward 3DGS across various
architectures and scenes, delivering consistently better rendering results. Our

Motivation: 现有视频理解模型在计数任务上表现不佳，且现有基准存在视频短、查询封闭、缺乏线索标注和多模态覆盖不足等问题。

Method: 提出CG-AV-Counting基准，包含长视频和多模态问题；开发AV-Reasoner模型，结合GRPO和课程学习。

Result: AV-Reasoner在多个基准上达到SOTA，但在域外基准上无性能提升。

Conclusion: CG-AV-Counting为计数任务提供了全面测试平台，AV-Reasoner展示了强化学习的有效性，但需改进域外泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite progress in video understanding, current MLLMs struggle with counting
tasks. Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack
of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce
CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with
1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It
supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive
testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to
improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained
with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related
tasks. AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. However,
experiments show that on out-of-domain benchmarks, reasoning in the language
space fails to bring performance gains. The code and benchmark have been

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态数学推理中存在依赖粗粒度图像区域、视觉编码器对数学内容感知有限以及需要外部视觉修改能力的限制。

Method: MINT-CoT通过Interleave Token动态选择数学图形中的视觉区域，构建了包含54K数学问题的数据集，并采用三阶段训练策略。

Result: MINT-CoT-7B在MathVista、GeoQA和MMStar上分别比基线模型提升了34.08%、28.78%和23.2%。

Conclusion: MINT-CoT在多模态数学推理中表现出色，为视觉与文本结合的推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has widely enhanced mathematical reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs), but it still remains challenging for extending it to
multimodal domains. Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for
image input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT.
However, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on
coarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders
on math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual
modification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical
INterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively
interleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an
Interleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within
math figures. To empower this capability, we construct the MINT-CoT dataset,
containing 54K mathematical problems aligning each reasoning step with visual
regions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline.
We further present a three-stage MINT-CoT training strategy, progressively
combining text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL, which
derives our MINT-CoT-7B model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for effective visual interleaved reasoning in
mathematical domains, where MINT-CoT-7B outperforms the baseline model by
+34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar, respectively. Our

Motivation: 现有长视频多模态模型训练因缺乏高质量长视频标注数据而受限，需填补这一空白。

Method: 构建VideoMarathon数据集（9,700小时长视频，3.3M QA对），并提出Hour-LLaVA模型，利用内存增强模块实现高效训练和推理。

Result: Hour-LLaVA在多个长视频语言基准测试中表现最佳，验证了数据集和模型的高质量。

Conclusion: VideoMarathon和Hour-LLaVA为长视频多模态理解提供了有效解决方案，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long

Result: 在多个现实场景和基准测试中显著提升了时空指向准确性和推理能力。

Conclusion: VideoMolmo通过结合语言模型和时序处理，实现了更优的时空定位性能。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal localization is vital for precise interactions across diverse
domains, from biological research to autonomous navigation and interactive
interfaces. Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack
the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting
their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a
large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing
conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture,
VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to
condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency.
Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for
bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video
sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate
precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module
to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language
model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets,
we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated
with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we
introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five
real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving,
Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring
Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to
existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing
accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如神经辐射场（NeRF）易产生模糊低分辨率图像，而RGB-D修复易出现幻觉，因此需要一种更可靠的去家具化方法。

Method: 首先从网格中分割并移除家具，生成简化去家具化网格（SDM），提取Canny边缘作为ControlNet修复的引导信号，最终修复全景图像并纹理化网格。

Result: 该方法生成的资产质量高于依赖NeRF或RGB-D修复的方法，避免了模糊和幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 提出的流程能够高效生成高质量的去家具化室内场景模型，优于现有技术。

Abstract: We present a pipeline for generating defurnished replicas of indoor spaces
represented as textured meshes and corresponding multi-view panoramic images.
To achieve this, we first segment and remove furniture from the mesh
representation, extend planes, and fill holes, obtaining a simplified
defurnished mesh (SDM). This SDM acts as an ``X-ray'' of the scene's underlying
structure, guiding the defurnishing process. We extract Canny edges from depth
and normal images rendered from the SDM. We then use these as a guide to remove
the furniture from panorama images via ControlNet inpainting. This control
signal ensures the availability of global geometric information that may be
hidden from a particular panoramic view by the furniture being removed. The
inpainted panoramas are used to texture the mesh. We show that our approach
produces higher quality assets than methods that rely on neural radiance
fields, which tend to produce blurry low-resolution images, or RGB-D
inpainting, which is highly susceptible to hallucinations.

Result: 实验表明，DirectLayout在语义一致性、泛化性和物理合理性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DirectLayout通过直接生成数值3D布局，实现了开放词汇和用户指令对齐的高质量场景合成。

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

Conclusion: RAS框架成功解决了全模态参考表达分割的挑战，为多模态交互提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

performance (85.14 on VBench) after training on 256 x 64GB Neural Processing
Units (NPUs) for merely four weeks. ContentV generates diverse, high-quality
videos across multiple resolutions and durations from text prompts, enabled by
three key innovations: (1) A minimalist architecture that maximizes reuse of
pre-trained image generation models for video generation; (2) A systematic
multi-stage training strategy leveraging flow matching for enhanced efficiency;
and (3) A cost-effective reinforcement learning with human feedback framework
that improves generation quality without requiring additional human

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究MLLMs如何处理视觉输入，揭示注意力机制中的稀疏性现象。

Method: 通过训练无关框架量化头的视觉相关性，设计SparseMM优化KV-Cache分配计算资源。

Result: SparseMM在主流多模态基准测试中实现1.38倍实时加速和52%内存节省，性能无损。

Conclusion: SparseMM通过利用视觉头的稀疏性，显著提升MLLMs的推理效率，为多模态模型优化提供新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending
pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this
work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their
attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small
subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively
contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these
heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies
head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on
this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that
allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual
scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference
of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the
particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual
semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal
benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52%
memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on
efficiency test. Our project is open sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强间接光环境下3D重建的挑战，并实现光传播的视图合成与分解。

Method: 扩展神经辐射缓存技术，结合时间分辨方法，捕捉直接与间接光传输效应。

Result: 在闪存激光雷达系统中实现高精度3D重建，支持多视角时间分辨重光照。

Conclusion: 系统在复杂光传输场景中表现出色，为光传播分析与渲染提供新工具。

Abstract: We present the first system for physically based, neural inverse rendering
from multi-viewpoint videos of propagating light. Our approach relies on a
time-resolved extension of neural radiance caching -- a technique that
accelerates inverse rendering by storing infinite-bounce radiance arriving at
any point from any direction. The resulting model accurately accounts for
direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured
measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we
demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of
captured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel
capabilities such as multi-view time-resolved relighting of captured scenes.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个数据集上的渲染质量显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeTimeGS通过灵活的4D表示和运动函数，有效提升了动态3D场景的建模能力。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with
complex motions. Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the
canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to
observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these
methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the
difficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we
propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives
to appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian
primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving
the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian
primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions
over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on
several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms
recent methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: VideoMathQA是一个评估模型在视频中进行跨模态数学推理能力的基准，涵盖10个数学领域，要求模型整合视觉、音频和文本信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的视频数学推理需要处理多模态、非线性的信息流，现有方法难以胜任。

Method: 通过专家标注的高质量数据集VideoMathQA，设计三类核心推理挑战：直接问题解决、概念迁移和深度教学理解。

Result: 基准测试揭示了现有方法的局限性，并提供了细粒度诊断模型能力的工具。

Conclusion: VideoMathQA为跨模态数学推理模型提供了系统评估框架，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning in real-world video settings presents a fundamentally
different challenge than in static images or text. It requires interpreting
fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital
text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In
such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on
selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a
rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a
benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally
extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse
mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.
It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand
instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and
textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,
totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,
questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem
solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual
transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep
instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended
explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes
multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model
capabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing
approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must
reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and
modality-rich mathematical problem settings. Our benchmark and evaluation code
are available at: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/VideoMathQA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种对比流匹配方法，通过显式增强条件流之间的唯一性，改进了条件生成模型的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在条件设置下，传统的流匹配方法无法保证流的唯一性，导致生成结果模糊。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了对比流匹配方法。

Method: 通过添加对比目标，最大化不同样本对预测流之间的差异性，从而增强条件分离。

Result: 实验表明，对比流匹配在训练速度、去噪步骤和生成质量（FID）上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 对比流匹配是一种有效的改进方法，能够显著提升条件生成模型的性能。

Abstract: Unconditional flow-matching trains diffusion models to transport samples from
a source distribution to a target distribution by enforcing that the flows
between sample pairs are unique. However, in conditional settings (e.g.,
class-conditioned models), this uniqueness is no longer guaranteed--flows from
different conditions may overlap, leading to more ambiguous generations. We
introduce Contrastive Flow Matching, an extension to the flow matching
objective that explicitly enforces uniqueness across all conditional flows,
enhancing condition separation. Our approach adds a contrastive objective that
maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs.
We validate Contrastive Flow Matching by conducting extensive experiments
across varying model architectures on both class-conditioned (ImageNet-1k) and
text-to-image (CC3M) benchmarks. Notably, we find that training models with
Contrastive Flow Matching (1) improves training speed by a factor of up to 9x,
(2) requires up to 5x fewer de-noising steps and (3) lowers FID by up to 8.9
compared to training the same models with flow matching. We release our code

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出一种动态P2P协议，能在高节点流失和大量恶意节点存在的情况下维持稀疏扩展拓扑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决P2P网络中动态拓扑构建和维护的挑战，确保连通性、低直径和高扩展性，同时抵御高流失和恶意节点。

Method: 使用随机化、完全分布式的动态P2P协议，仅需本地初始知识，保证高概率下维持高扩展性的常数度图。

Result: 协议能容忍最多$o(n/poly\log(n))$的恶意节点，维护开销仅为$O(poly\log(n))$。

Conclusion: 该协议可作为构建块，解决高动态网络中的分布式计算问题，如拜占庭协议和领导者选举。

Abstract: We address a fundamental problem in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks, namely,
constructing and maintaining dynamic P2P overlay network topologies with
essential properties such as connectivity, low diameter, and high expansion,
that are resilient to continuous high churn and the presence of a large number
of malicious (Byzantine) nodes. Our main goal is to construct and maintain a
sparse (bounded degree) expander topology despite high churn and a large number
of Byzantine nodes. Such an expander topology has logarithmic diameter, high
expansion, and is robust to churn and the presence of a large number of bad
nodes, and facilitates efficient and robust algorithms for fundamental problems
in distributed computing, such as agreement, broadcasting, routing, etc.
  Our main contribution is a randomized, fully-distributed dynamic P2P protocol
that works with only local initial knowledge and guarantees, with a high
probability, the maintenance of a constant degree graph with high expansion
even under continuous churn and in the presence of a large number of Byzantine
nodes. Our protocol can tolerate up to $o(n/poly\log(n))$ Byzantine nodes
(where $n$ is the stable network size). Our protocol is efficient, lightweight,
and scalable, and it incurs only $O(poly\log(n))$ overhead for topology
maintenance: only polylogarithmic (in $n$) bits need to be processed and sent
by each honest node per round, and any honest node's computation cost per round
is also polylogarithmic.
  Our protocol can be used as a building block for solving fundamental
distributed computing problems in highly dynamic networks, such as Byzantine
agreement and Byzantine leader election, and enables fast and scalable
algorithms for these problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型实现存在GPU利用率低、延迟高和无法利用任务局部性的问题，限制了大规模神经网络的训练效率。

Method: 开发了FlashDMoE，通过单一持久GPU内核融合计算与通信，实现细粒度流水线调度和设备启动的高效数据传输。

Result: 在8-H100 GPU节点上，FlashDMoE实现了6倍延迟降低、5.7倍吞吐提升、4倍弱扩展效率和9倍GPU利用率提升。

Conclusion: FlashDMoE证明了GPU内核与硬件协同设计对提升大规模分布式ML工作负载性能的关键作用。

Abstract: The computational sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enables
sub-linear growth in compute cost as model size increases, offering a scalable
path to training massive neural networks. However, existing implementations
suffer from \emph{low GPU utilization}, \emph{significant latency overhead},
and a fundamental \emph{inability to leverage task locality}, primarily due to
CPU-managed scheduling, host-initiated communication, and frequent kernel
launches. To overcome these limitations, we develop FlashDMoE, a fully
GPU-resident MoE operator that fuses expert computation and inter-GPU
communication into a \emph{single persistent GPU kernel}. FlashDMoE enables
fine-grained pipelining of dispatch, compute, and combine phases, eliminating
launch overheads and reducing idle gaps. Its device-initiated communication
protocol introduces \emph{payload-efficient} data transfers, significantly
shrinking buffer sizes in sparsely activated MoE layers. When evaluated on a
single 8-H100 GPU node with MoE models having up to 128 experts and 16K token
sequences, FlashDMoE achieves up to \textbf{6}x lower latency, \textbf{5,7}x
higher throughput, \textbf{4}x better weak scaling efficiency, and \textbf{9}x
higher GPU utilization compared to state-of-the-art baselines, despite using
FP32 while baselines use FP16. FlashDMoE demonstrates that principled GPU
kernel-hardware co-design is key to unlocking the performance ceiling of
large-scale distributed ML workloads.

Result: 仿真显示KATO能以较低计算开销实现最优或接近最优性能，且适用于不同规模和配置的网络。

Conclusion: KATO是一种高效且通用的任务卸载方法，适用于车辆边缘计算场景。

Abstract: Vehicle edge computing (VEC) brings abundant computing resources close to
vehicles by deploying them at roadside units (RSUs) or base stations, thereby
enabling diverse computation-intensive and delay sensitive applications.
Existing task offloading strategies are often computationally expensive to
execute or generate suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel
learning-based approach, Knowledge-guided Attention-inspired Task Offloading
(KATO), designed to efficiently offload tasks from moving vehicles to nearby
RSUs. KATO integrates an attention-inspired encoder-decoder model for selecting
a subset of RSUs that can reduce overall task processing time, along with an
efficient iterative algorithm for computing optimal task allocation among the
selected RSUs. Simulation results demonstrate that KATO achieves optimal or
near-optimal performance with significantly lower computational overhead and
generalizes well across networks of varying sizes and configurations.

Abstract: Byzantine agreement is a fundamental problem in fault-tolerant distributed
computing that has been studied intensively for the last four decades. Much of
the research has focused on a static Byzantine adversary, where the adversary
is constrained to choose the Byzantine nodes in advance of the protocol's
execution. This work focuses on the harder case of an adaptive Byzantine
adversary that can choose the Byzantine nodes \emph{adaptively} based on the
protocol's execution. While efficient $O(\log n)$-round protocols ($n$ is the
total number of nodes) are known for the static adversary (Goldwasser, Pavlov,
and Vaikuntanathan, FOCS 2006) tolerating up to $t < n/(3+\epsilon)$ Byzantine
nodes, $\Omega(t/\sqrt{n \log n})$ rounds is a well-known lower bound for
adaptive adversary [Bar-Joseph and Ben-Or, PODC 1998]. The best-known protocol
for adaptive adversary runs in $O(t/\log n)$ rounds [Chor and Coan, IEEE Trans.
Soft. Engg., 1985].
  This work presents a synchronous randomized Byzantine agreement protocol
under an adaptive adversary that improves over previous results. Our protocol
works under the powerful \emph{adaptive rushing adversary in the full
information model}. That is, we assume that the Byzantine nodes can behave
arbitrarily and maliciously, have knowledge about the entire state of the
network at every round, including random choices made by all the nodes up to
and including the current round, have unlimited computational power, and may
collude among themselves. Furthermore, the adversary can \emph{adaptively}
corrupt up to $t < n/3$ nodes based on the protocol's execution. We present a
simple randomized Byzantine agreement protocol that runs in $O(\min\{t^2\log
n/n, t/\log n\})$ rounds that improves over the long-standing bound of
$O(t/\log n)$ rounds due to Chor and Coan [IEEE Trans. Soft. Engg., 1985].

Motivation: 公开可用的Verilog代码远少于其他软件语言（如Python），限制了LLM在硬件代码生成中的应用。

Method: 提出hdl2v数据集，通过翻译或编译VHDL、Chisel和PyMTL3为Verilog，增加数据量。

Result: 使用hdl2v后，32B参数模型的Verilog生成性能提升23%（pass@10），数据增强微调方法性能提升63%。

Conclusion: hdl2v数据集有效提升了LLM的Verilog生成能力，未来可进一步优化数据集特性以提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in
domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where
Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog
code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages
like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which
seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by
translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,
Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v
in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32
billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,
without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger
models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data
augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and
analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of
HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多核时序干扰是时间关键应用的主要问题，现有带宽控制方法虽有效但配置复杂，限制了其在模块化ROS2应用中的广泛应用。

Method: 提出ROSGuard，基于ROS2和Linux软件栈，实现带宽监控与控制，并在NVIDIA AGX Orin平台上部署测试。

Result: 在合成和真实基准测试中，ROSGuard实现了与专用细粒度方案相当的效果。

Conclusion: ROSGuard为模块化ROS2应用提供了一种高效且可移植的时序干扰控制方案。

Abstract: Multicore timing interference, arising when multiple requests contend for the
same shared hardware resources, is a primary concern for timing verification
and validation of time-critical applications. Bandwidth control and regulation
approaches have been proposed in the literature as an effective method to
monitor and limit the impact of timing interference at run time. These
approaches seek for fine-grained control of the bandwidth consumption (at the
microsecond level) to meet stringent timing requirements on embedded critical
systems. Such granularity and configurations, while effective, can become an
entry barrier for the application of bandwidth control to a wide class of
productized, modular ROS2 applications. This is so because those applications
have less stringent timing requirements but would still benefit from bandwidth
regulation, though under less restrictive, and therefore more portable,
granularity and configurations.
  In this work, we provide ROSGuard, a highly-portable, modular implementation
of a timing interference monitoring and control mechanism that builds on the
abstractions available on top of a generic and portable Linux-based software
stack with the Robotic Operating System 2 (ROS2) layer, a widespreadedly
adopted middleware for a wide class of industrial applications, far beyond the
robotic domain. We deploy ROSGuard on an NVIDIA AGX Orin platform as a
representative target for functionally rich distributed AI-based applications
and a set of synthetic and real-world benchmarks. We apply an effective
bandwidth regulation scheme on ROS2-based applications and achieve comparable
effectiveness to specialized, finer-grained state-of-the-art solutions.

Abstract: Processor chip design technology serves as a key frontier driving
breakthroughs in computer science and related fields. With the rapid
advancement of information technology, conventional design paradigms face three
major challenges: the physical constraints of fabrication technologies, the
escalating demands for design resources, and the increasing diversity of
ecosystems. Automated processor chip design has emerged as a transformative
solution to address these challenges. While recent breakthroughs in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) techniques, have
opened new possibilities for fully automated processor chip design, substantial
challenges remain in establishing domain-specific LLMs for processor chip
design.
  In this paper, we propose QiMeng, a novel system for fully automated hardware
and software design of processor chips. QiMeng comprises three hierarchical
layers. In the bottom-layer, we construct a domain-specific Large Processor
Chip Model (LPCM) that introduces novel designs in architecture, training, and
inference, to address key challenges such as knowledge representation gap, data
scarcity, correctness assurance, and enormous solution space. In the
middle-layer, leveraging the LPCM's knowledge representation and inference
capabilities, we develop the Hardware Design Agent and the Software Design
Agent to automate the design of hardware and software for processor chips.
Currently, several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully
applied in various top-layer applications, demonstrating significant advantages
and providing a feasible solution for efficient, fully automated
hardware/software design of processor chips. Future research will focus on
integrating all components and performing iterative top-down and bottom-up
design processes to establish a comprehensive QiMeng system.

### [233] [Becoming Immutable: How Ethereum is Made](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04940)
*Andrea Canidio,Vabuk Pahari*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 分析了2024年12月3日8分钟内以太坊区块链的区块提案数据，发现独占交易占获胜区块费用的85%，许多用户交易被延迟，且识别出两个套利机器人在DEX和CEX之间的交易。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究以太坊区块提案中的交易行为和套利机会，揭示独占交易对费用的影响以及交易延迟现象。

Method: 分析38个获胜区块、15,097个提案区块、10,793笔独特交易和2,380,014个交易-区块配对的数据集。

Result: 独占交易占获胜区块费用的85%；许多交易被延迟，尤其是独占于失败提案者的交易；套利机器人在CEX上的交易价格比Binance优3.4-4.2个基点。

Conclusion: 独占交易对费用贡献显著，交易延迟现象普遍，套利机器人存在价格优势。

Abstract: We analyze blocks proposed for inclusion in the Ethereum blockchain during 8
minutes on December 3rd, 2024. Our dataset comprises 38 winning blocks, 15,097
proposed blocks, 10,793 unique transactions, and 2,380,014 transaction-block
pairings. We find that exclusive transactions--transactions present only in
blocks proposed by a single builder--account for 85% of the fees paid by all
transactions included in winning blocks. We also find that a surprisingly large
number of user transactions are delayed: although proposed during a bidding
cycle, they are not included in the corresponding winning block. Many such
delayed transactions are exclusive to a losing builder. We also identify two
arbitrage bots trading between decentralized (DEX) and centralized exchanges
(CEX). By examining their bidding dynamics, we estimate that the implied price
at which these bots trade USDC/WETH and USDT/WETH on CEXes is between 3.4 and
4.2 basis points better than the contemporaneous price reported on Binance.

### [234] [Grapheme-Coherent Phonemic and Prosodic Annotation of Speech by Implicit and Explicit Grapheme Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04527)
*Hien Ohnaka,Yuma Shirahata,Byeongseon Park,Ryuichi Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出一种模型，通过隐式和显式方法将音素和韵律标签与字形关联，显著提升一致性，并在口音估计任务中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅通过微调预训练ASR模型生成标签，缺乏与字形的直接关联。本研究旨在通过字形条件化生成更一致的标签，适用于TTS等下游任务。

Method: 1) 使用预训练BERT特征通过提示编码器隐式条件化；2) 在推理阶段显式修剪与字形不一致的标签假设。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了字形与预测标签的一致性，并在口音估计任务中提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 通过字形条件化生成的并行数据能有效提升下游任务性能，为语音处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

*Te Ma,Min Bi,Saierdaer Yusuyin,Hao Huang,Zhijian Ou*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的音素到字素解码方法（LLM-P2G），用于音素基础的自动语音识别（ASR），解决了传统WFST解码的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WFST解码在音素基础的ASR中存在流程复杂且无法利用大型语言模型的问题，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出LLM-P2G解码方法，包括语音到音素（S2P）和音素到字素（P2G）两个阶段，并通过数据增强（DANP）和随机化Top-K边缘化训练（TKM）解决信息丢失问题。

Result: 实验表明，LLM-P2G在波兰语和德语的跨语言ASR中，相对WER分别降低了3.6%和6.9%，优于WFST系统。

Conclusion: LLM-P2G是一种高效且性能优越的解码方法，适用于音素基础的跨语言ASR。

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

TL;DR: 联邦学习中参数高效微调（PEFT）的隐私漏洞研究，通过恶意设计的预训练模型和适配器模块，攻击者可以重构用户本地数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在联邦学习中使用PEFT时，用户微调数据的隐私如何因预训练模型和适配器模块的恶意设计而受到威胁。

Method: 通过梯度反转攻击，利用可访问的适配器梯度重构目标用户的本地数据样本。

Result: 实验表明，攻击者可以高保真地恢复大批量微调图像。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了PEFT中隐私保护机制的必要性，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

*Isha Rao,Sanjay Ghosh*

TL;DR: 提出一种轻量级深度学习方法，结合Retinex分解与泊松去噪，用于极端低光条件下的图像去噪与增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统高斯噪声假设不适用于低光成像中信号依赖的泊松噪声问题。

Method: 集成Retinex分解与泊松去噪的编码器-解码器网络，结合泊松去噪损失函数。

Result: 显著提升低光条件下的可见性与亮度，同时保持图像结构和颜色一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在低光图像增强中表现出高效性与实用性。

Abstract: Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when
traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority.
In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is
signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we
address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme
low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method
that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a
unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination
and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address
signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and
illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while
ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any
form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination
enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness
in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy
under ambient illumination.

TL;DR: DACN是一种双注意力卷积网络，用于解决高光谱图像超分辨率任务中局部依赖和全局上下文不足的问题，通过多头注意力和通道-空间注意力提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D CNN在高光谱图像超分辨率任务中依赖局部邻域，缺乏全局上下文理解，且受限于波段相关性和数据稀缺性。

Method: DACN结合多头注意力捕捉局部和全局特征依赖，通过通道和空间注意力图优化关注点，并设计L2正则化和空间-光谱梯度损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，多头注意力与通道注意力的结合优于单独使用任一注意力机制。

Conclusion: DACN通过双注意力机制和定制损失函数，显著提升了高光谱图像超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted significant attention
for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. However, a key limitation is
their reliance on local neighborhoods, which leads to a lack of global
contextual understanding. Moreover, band correlation and data scarcity continue
to limit their performance. To mitigate these issues, we introduce DACN, a
dual-attention convolutional network for hyperspectral image super-resolution.
Specifically, the model first employs augmented convolutions, integrating
multi-head attention to effectively capture both local and global feature
dependencies. Next, we infer separate attention maps for the channel and
spatial dimensions to determine where to focus across different channels and
spatial positions. Furthermore, a custom optimized loss function is proposed
that combines L2 regularization with spatial-spectral gradient loss to ensure
accurate spectral fidelity. Experimental results on two hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate that the combination of multi-head attention and channel attention
outperforms either attention mechanism used individually.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决病理学中数据稀缺、隐私保护和生成任务（如虚拟染色）的挑战，同时利用大规模无标注数据进行训练。

Method: 采用渐进式训练策略和基于自监督的条件化方法，在PanCan-30M数据集上训练PixCell模型。

Result: PixCell生成多样且高质量的图像，可用于替代真实数据训练模型，支持数据共享和增强，并能通过少量标注图像精确控制生成。

Conclusion: PixCell为计算病理学提供了强大的生成工具，支持数据共享、增强和教育应用，并展示了从H&E图像推断分子标记结果的潜力。

Abstract: The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing
massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised
and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology
datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative
models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a
compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve
synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling
privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks,
such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based
generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M,
a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images
covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a
self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without
any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across
multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train
a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between
institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case
with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely
control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be
used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell
segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation,
improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to
use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we
use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models
are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DM-SegNet提出了一种双Mamba架构，结合方向性状态转换和解剖感知分层解码，解决了现有医学SSM中编码器-解码器不兼容的问题，显著提升了3D医学图像分割的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学SSM在编码器中将1D序列扁平化会破坏空间结构，而传统解码器无法利用Mamba的状态传播能力，导致全局上下文建模与空间拓扑保持之间的矛盾。

Method: DM-SegNet采用四方向3D扫描的Mamba模块保持空间一致性，引入门控空间卷积层增强特征表示，并通过Mamba驱动的解码框架实现跨尺度的双向状态同步。

Result: 在Synapse数据集上达到85.44%的DSC（腹部器官分割），在BraTS2023数据集上达到90.22%的DSC（脑肿瘤分割），均为当前最佳性能。

Conclusion: DM-SegNet通过创新的双Mamba架构和层次化解码，有效解决了医学图像分割中的空间建模问题，具有显著的临床意义。

Abstract: Accurate 3D medical image segmentation demands architectures capable of
reconciling global context modeling with spatial topology preservation. While
State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba show potential for sequence modeling,
existing medical SSMs suffer from encoder-decoder incompatibility: the
encoder's 1D sequence flattening compromises spatial structures, while
conventional decoders fail to leverage Mamba's state propagation. We present
DM-SegNet, a Dual-Mamba architecture integrating directional state transitions
with anatomy-aware hierarchical decoding. The core innovations include a
quadri-directional spatial Mamba module employing four-directional 3D scanning
to maintain anatomical spatial coherence, a gated spatial convolution layer
that enhances spatially sensitive feature representation prior to state
modeling, and a Mamba-driven decoding framework enabling bidirectional state
synchronization across scales. Extensive evaluation on two clinically
significant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving
state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse
dataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset
for brain tumor segmentation.

Method: 采用连续时间扩散模型，引入SSIMBaD技术，通过sigma空间变换对齐感知退化，确保时间步长的视觉难度一致。

Result: 在大规模动漫面部数据集上，该方法在像素精度和感知质量上均优于现有模型，并能泛化到多样风格。

Conclusion: SSIMBaD框架在动漫面部上色任务中表现出色，具有更高的重建质量和风格适应性。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

Abstract: Mesh deformation is a fundamental tool in 3D content manipulation. Despite
extensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output
quality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive
training. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free,
handle-based mesh deformation method. % Our core idea is to leverage a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret and manipulate a handle-based
interface through prompt engineering. We begin by applying cone singularity
detection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then
prompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles
that best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired
deformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce
uncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple
camera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of
benchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user
intent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low
distortion -- quantified via membrane energy. In summary, our approach is
training-free, highly automated, and consistently delivers high-quality mesh
deformations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种实例中心的3D语义占用预测方法VoxDet，通过将体素级任务分解为偏移回归和语义预测，显著提升了实例级完整性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D语义占用预测视为密集分割任务，忽略了实例级判别性，导致实例不完整和相邻模糊。论文发现体素级标签隐含实例信息，利用这一观察提出了改进方法。

Method: 提出VoxDet框架，包括：1）训练无关的Voxel-to-Instance（VoxNT）方法，将体素标签转换为实例偏移标签；2）使用空间解耦的体素编码器和任务解耦的密集预测器，分别处理偏移回归和语义预测。

Result: VoxDet在相机和LiDAR输入下均达到SOTA性能，SemanticKITTI测试集上获得63.0 IoU，排名第一。

Conclusion: VoxDet通过实例中心的设计显著提升了3D语义占用预测的性能，证明了实例信息的重要性。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry and
semantics of the surrounding environment. With dense voxel labels, prior works
typically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying
each voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric
discriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent
ambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:
the voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,
which is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first
introduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet
effective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into
instance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an
instance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy
prediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:
offset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D
volume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate
disentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific
spatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we
deploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense
detection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6
directions) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed
offsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the
classification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show
that VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving
state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks. VoxDet is not only highly
efficient, but also achieves 63.0 IoU on the SemanticKITTI test set, ranking
1st on the online leaderboard.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种快速且无监督的多边形近似闭合数字曲线的方案，其速度优于现有技术，并在Rosin度量及美学方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多边形近似方法在速度和美学表现上存在不足，需要一种更高效且美观的解决方案。

Method: 方案分为三个阶段：初始分割、迭代顶点插入和迭代合并，最后进行顶点调整。初始分割检测高曲率顶点，迭代插入补充低曲率顶点，合并去除冗余顶点，调整优化美学效果。

Result: 该方法在Rosin度量下表现优异，且对几何变换具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方案在速度和美学上均优于现有技术，适用于闭合数字曲线的多边形近似。

Abstract: This paper proposes a fast and unsupervised scheme for a polygonal
approximation of a closed digital curve. It is demonstrated that the
approximation scheme is faster than state-of-the-art approximation and is
competitive with the same in Rosin's measure and in its aesthetic aspect. The
scheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex
insertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial
segmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly
have high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low
curvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex
insertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes
slowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices
and so merging is used to eliminate the redundant vertices. Finally, vertex
adjustment is used to facilitate enhancement in the aesthetic look of the
approximation. The quality of the approximations is measured using Rosin's
measure. The robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to geometric
transformation is observed.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过强化学习框架来确保自主代理在决策时保持上下文完整性的方法，显著减少了不适当的信息披露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主代理为用户做决策的时代到来，确保上下文完整性（CI）成为核心问题。作者认为CI需要代理能够推理其操作上下文。

Method: 首先通过提示LLM显式推理CI，然后开发了一个强化学习框架，进一步训练模型以实现CI。使用了一个包含约700个多样上下文和披露规范的合成数据集。

Result: 方法显著减少了不适当的信息披露，同时保持了任务性能。改进效果从合成数据集迁移到了人类标注的CI基准测试（如PrivacyLens）。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习框架和显式推理，可以有效提升自主代理的上下文完整性，减少隐私泄露风险。

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

TL;DR: CircuGraphRAG是一种基于知识图谱的检索增强生成框架，用于解决大语言模型在可持续制造中的幻觉问题，提升准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在可持续制造中常产生错误的工业代码和排放因子，影响决策。

Method: CircuGraphRAG通过领域知识图谱（包含117,380个实体）和多跳推理，将自然语言查询转换为SPARQL并验证子图。

Result: 在单跳和多跳问答任务中表现优异（ROUGE-L F1达1.0），响应时间减半，令牌使用减少16%。

Conclusion: CircuGraphRAG为循环经济提供了可靠、低碳的决策支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific
knowledge graph for the circular economy. This graph connects 117,380
industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready
support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource
decision making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了Matter-of-Fact数据集，用于评估假设的可行性，以优化科学发现中的实验成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动生成假设和实验成本高昂，尤其是大规模实验。通过筛选可行性假设，可以提高科学发现的效率和成功率。

Method: 构建了包含8.4k科学假设的数据集，涵盖材料科学的多个领域，并测试了检索增强生成和代码生成等基线方法。

Result: 基线模型性能不超过72%（随机概率为50%），但专家验证表明大多数假设是可解决的。

Conclusion: 当前模型在此任务上表现有限，但改进潜力巨大，有望加速科学发现。

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

Motivation: 揭示现有开源推理模型（如Deepseek-R1-Distill系列和QwQ-32B）评估结果的不稳定性，强调需要更可靠的性能评估方法。

Method: 通过实证评估分析Deepseek-R1-Distill系列模型在不同条件下的性能波动。

Result: 评估结果受细微条件差异影响显著，性能改进难以稳定复现。

Conclusion: 提出需要建立更严格的模型性能评估范式以确保结果的可信度。

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着具有链式思维（CoT）推理能力的先进系统可能战略性欺骗人类，研究LLMs的诚实性成为关键对齐挑战。

Method: 使用表示工程技术，通过线性人工断层扫描（LAT）提取“欺骗向量”，并利用激活引导诱导欺骗行为。

Result: 实现了89%的欺骗检测准确率和40%的欺骗诱导成功率。

Conclusion: 揭示了推理模型在诚实性方面的具体问题，并为可信AI对齐提供了工具。

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-First Search (LFS) 是一种新型的LLM自引导搜索方法，通过让LLM自主控制搜索过程，无需预定义搜索策略，提高了灵活性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有搜索方法（如MCTS）依赖固定的探索超参数，难以适应不同难度的任务，限制了其实际应用。

Method: LFS利用LLM的内部评分机制自主决定搜索路径，无需外部启发式或硬编码策略。

Result: LFS在Countdown和Sudoku任务中表现优于ToT-BFS、BestFS和MCTS，计算效率更高，且随模型和计算预算的增加表现更优。

Conclusion: LFS是一种无需手动调整、适应性强且高效的搜索方法，尤其适用于复杂推理任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学AI系统缺乏系统的领域专业知识整合，可能影响诊断的可靠性。

Method: 开发了基于本体的框架，包括层次神经网络、VQA系统和多模态深度学习模型，结合临床数据和本体关系。

Result: 框架展示了标准化结构和可重用组件的潜力，但实验验证尚未完成。

Conclusion: 未来工作将扩展临床数据集并进行系统验证，以进一步验证框架的有效性。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic
domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability.
This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and
Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a
hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for
segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological
relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through
systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping,
and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for
extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource
limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and
conducting comprehensive system validation.

Motivation: 探讨公开可用的NLP工具是否能满足实践者在评估LLM系统时的需求。

Result: 实践者常因工具不实用或存在实际障碍而无法使用现有工具。

Conclusion: 建议结合测量理论和实用测量方法改进工具，以更好地满足实践者需求。

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

Motivation: 现有MLLM在检测上下文无关虚假信息时，难以捕捉图像与文本间的深层语义关联，且证据噪声影响准确性。

Method: 提出CMIE框架，包含共存关系生成（CRG）策略和关联评分（AS）机制，识别图像与文本的共存关系并选择性利用证据。

Result: 实验表明，CMIE优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CMIE通过增强语义关联识别和证据选择，有效提升了虚假信息检测的准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies
have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC)
misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of
this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning
and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to
capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and
text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic
links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To
address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection
framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG)
strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the
underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively
utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着存储技术的发展，NVM等新型存储介质的出现为缓存中间件设计提供了更多选择，但如何在固定预算下优化配置层次结构、是否复制数据等问题仍需解决。

Method: 将缓存配置问题建模为多选择背包问题（MCKP），利用其线性规划松弛高效近似求解，并结合应用特性和负载评估设计权衡。

Result: 结果表明，在特定故障率和负载特性下选择性复制更优，而在低故障率和高频率数据更新时，数据分层优于复制。

Conclusion: 通过MCKP模型和高效算法，可以在多级缓存设计中实现性能优化，具体策略需根据故障率和负载特性选择。

Abstract: Advances in storage technology have introduced Non-Volatile Memory, NVM, as a
new storage medium. NVM, along with Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Solid
State Disk (SSD), and Disk present a system designer with a wide array of
options in designing caching middleware. Moreover, design decisions to
replicate a data item in more than one level of a caching memory hierarchy may
enhance the overall system performance with a faster recovery time in the event
of a memory failure. Given a fixed budget, the key configuration questions are:
Which storage media should constitute the memory hierarchy? What is the storage
capacity of each hierarchy? Should data be replicated or partitioned across the
different levels of the hierarchy? We model these cache configuration questions
as an instance of the Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP). This model is
guided by the specification of each type of memory along with an application's
database characteristics and its workload. Although MCKP is NP-complete, its
linear programming relaxation is efficiently solvable and can be used to
closely approximate the optimal solution. We use the resulting simple algorithm
to evaluate design tradeoffs in the context of a memory hierarchy for a
Key-Value Store (e.g., memcached) as well as a host-side cache (e.g.,
Flashcache). The results show selective replication is appropriate with certain
failure rates and workload characteristics. With a slim failure rate and
frequent data updates, tiering of data across the different storage media that
constitute the cache is superior to replication.

Conclusion: 该框架为多相流模拟提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，适用于复杂多孔介质中的流动问题。

Abstract: The modeling and simulation of multiphase fluid flow receive significant
attention in reservoir engineering. Many time discretization schemes for
multiphase flow equations are either explicit or semi-implicit, relying on the
decoupling between the saturation equation and the pressure equation. In this
study, we delve into a fully coupled and fully implicit framework for
simulating multiphase flow in heterogeneous porous media, considering gravity
and capillary effects. We utilize the Vertex-Centered Finite Volume Method for
spatial discretization and propose an efficient implementation of interface
conditions for heterogeneous porous media within the current scheme. Notably,
we introduce the Linearly Implicit Extrapolation Method (LIMEX) with an error
estimator, adapted for the first time to multiphase flow problems. To solve the
resulting linear system, we employ the BiCGSTAB method with the Geometric
Multigrid (GMG) preconditioner. The implementations of models and methods are
based on the open-source software: UG4. The results from parallel computations
on the supercomputer demonstrate that the scalability of our proposed framework
is sufficient, supporting a scale of thousands of processors with Degrees of
Freedom (DoF) extending up to billions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂3D场景理解和动态空间推理方面表现不足，需要更强大的模型来支持机器人交互。

Method: 提出RoboRefer，结合SFT和RFT，使用RefSpatial数据集（20M QA对）进行训练，并引入RefSpatial-Bench评估。

Result: SFT训练的RoboRefer空间理解成功率89.6%，RFT训练的RoboRefer在RefSpatial-Bench上超越Gemini-2.5-Pro 17.4%。

Conclusion: RoboRefer能集成多种控制策略，支持机器人在复杂场景中执行动态任务。

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

Motivation: 越野自主性中，地形的可通行性常依赖于车辆状态（如接近角度），传统方法需要大量数据和重复计算，效率低下。

Method: SPARTA利用傅里叶基函数构建平滑解析函数，预测任意接近角度的风险分布，减少计算开销并支持重复查询。

Result: 在高保真仿真中，SPARTA在40米巨石场中的通过成功率达91%，优于基线（73%），并在硬件测试中验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPARTA通过几何结构和傅里叶基函数，高效解决了状态依赖的地形可通行性问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: A key open challenge in off-road autonomy is that the traversability of
terrain often depends on the vehicle's state. In particular, some obstacles are
only traversable from some orientations. However, learning this interaction by
encoding the angle of approach as a model input demands a large and diverse
training dataset and is computationally inefficient during planning due to
repeated model inference. To address these challenges, we present SPARTA, a
method for estimating approach angle conditioned traversability from point
clouds. Specifically, we impose geometric structure into our network by
outputting a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere that predicts risk
distribution for any angle of approach with minimal overhead and can be reused
for subsequent queries. The function is composed of Fourier basis functions,
which has important advantages for generalization due to their periodic nature
and smoothness. We demonstrate SPARTA both in a high-fidelity simulation
platform, where our model achieves a 91\% success rate crossing a 40m boulder
field (compared to 73\% for the baseline), and on hardware, illustrating the
generalization ability of the model to real-world settings.

Abstract: The use of robotics in humanitarian demining increasingly involves computer
vision techniques to improve landmine detection capabilities. However, in the
absence of diverse and realistic datasets, the reliable validation of
algorithms remains a challenge for the research community. In this paper, we
introduce MineInsight, a publicly available multi-sensor, multi-spectral
dataset designed for off-road landmine detection. The dataset features 35
different targets (15 landmines and 20 commonly found objects) distributed
along three distinct tracks, providing a diverse and realistic testing
environment. MineInsight is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset to
integrate dual-view sensor scans from both an Unmanned Ground Vehicle and its
robotic arm, offering multiple viewpoints to mitigate occlusions and improve
spatial awareness. It features two LiDARs, as well as images captured at
diverse spectral ranges, including visible (RGB, monochrome), visible
short-wave infrared (VIS-SWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR). Additionally,
the dataset comes with an estimation of the location of the targets, offering a
benchmark for evaluating detection algorithms. We recorded approximately one
hour of data in both daylight and nighttime conditions, resulting in around
38,000 RGB frames, 53,000 VIS-SWIR frames, and 108,000 LWIR frames. MineInsight
serves as a benchmark for developing and evaluating landmine detection

Abstract: Annotated datasets are critical for training neural networks for object
detection, yet their manual creation is time- and labour-intensive, subjective
to human error, and often limited in diversity. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios
further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we
propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in
Unreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for
rapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can
achieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while
significantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data.
Additionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases
object detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images
with the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the
first application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in
the highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation
experiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par
with one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot
soccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive
alternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive
error-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator
where all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations
while significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly
valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training
data.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive
versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process
that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn
inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and
behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about
system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the
first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their
resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power
consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling
strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as
few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact
accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy
with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening
latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed
evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational
demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability
crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward
compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under
real-world constraints.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical model that addresses the economic trade-off between
cost per token versus serial token generation speed when deploying LLMs for
inference at scale. Our model takes into account arithmetic, memory bandwidth,
network bandwidth and latency constraints; and optimizes over different
parallelism setups and batch sizes to find the ones that optimize serial
inference speed at a given cost per token. We use the model to compute Pareto
frontiers of serial speed versus cost per token for popular language models.

Abstract: Recently, federated learning frameworks such as Python TestBed for Federated

have emerged to tackle user privacy concerns and efficiency in embedded

algorithm, FLiForest, based on Isolation Forests has been developed, offering a

continuous learning. In this paper, we present an application of Isolation
Forest-based temperature anomaly detection, developed using the previously
mentioned federated learning frameworks, aimed at small edge devices and IoT
systems running MicroPython. The system has been experimentally evaluated,
achieving over 96% accuracy in distinguishing normal from abnormal readings and
above 78% precision in detecting anomalies across all tested configurations,
while maintaining a memory usage below 160 KB during model training. These
results highlight its suitability for resource-constrained environments and
edge systems, while upholding federated learning principles of data privacy and

Motivation: 分布式学习中通信压缩是主要瓶颈，误差反馈方法（如EF和EF²¹）用于缓解压缩通信导致的收敛退化。

Method: 通过寻找最优Lyapunov函数，分析EF和EF²¹的收敛率，并与压缩梯度下降进行公平比较。

Conclusion: 在简化但具代表性的设置下，本文为误差反馈方法提供了清晰的理论见解和公平的性能比较。

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统性是组合性的核心特性，能提升模型在新情境下的泛化能力。现有研究多关注行为系统性，而忽略了表征系统性，本文旨在强调这一区别并填补空白。

Method: 基于Hadley（1994）的分类法，分析了语言和视觉领域的关键基准测试对行为系统性的评估程度，并借鉴机制可解释性领域的方法评估表征系统性。

Result: 现有基准测试主要测试行为系统性，而对表征系统性的评估不足。机制可解释性领域的方法为评估表征系统性提供了可行途径。

Conclusion: 应更重视表征系统性的评估，结合行为与表征两方面的系统性测试，以全面理解模型的系统性能力。

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的差分隐私（DP）语言模型推理方法，通过聚类输入数据和私有计算中位数来提升合成文本的质量和隐私保护效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过均匀随机采样敏感输入生成合成文本，但这种方法在输入数据涉及异质主题时会降低文本质量。

Method: 首先对输入数据进行聚类，然后通过私有计算中位数（而非平均值）来聚合下一个标记的统计信息，从而利用中位数在预测相似时的低局部敏感性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在代表性指标（如MAUVE）和下游任务性能上均有提升，能以更低的隐私成本生成高质量合成数据。

Conclusion: 通过聚类和私有中位数聚合，本文方法显著提升了差分隐私语言模型推理的效果，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: 结论表明，Urania成功平衡了数据效用与隐私保护，为LLM交互分析提供了可行的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided
approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and
histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.
Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

Motivation: GNN在节点分类任务中存在度偏差问题，现有基于GCL的方法因正样本对有限和权重分配不均导致低度节点信息不足和噪声问题。

Method: 提出HAR对比损失，利用节点标签增加正样本对，并根据学习难度自适应加权正负样本对；开发SHARP框架扩展HAR的应用范围。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，SHARP在全局和度级别上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HAR和SHARP能有效缓解GNN中的度偏差问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

TL;DR: Diagonal Batching 是一种调度方案，解决了 RMTs 的顺序执行瓶颈，实现了并行化，显著提升了长上下文推理的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer 模型在长上下文推理中存在时间和内存复杂度高的问题，而 RMTs 虽然降低了复杂度，但顺序执行导致性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出了 Diagonal Batching 调度方案，通过重新排序计算实现并行化，同时保留精确的递归关系。

Result: 在 LLaMA-1B ARMT 模型上，Diagonal Batching 实现了 3.3 倍的速度提升，并显著降低了推理成本和延迟。

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching 提升了 RMTs 的实用性，使其成为长上下文应用的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

Result: 在十亿参数规模的语言模型中，Mesa层显著降低了困惑度并提升了长上下文任务性能。

Conclusion: 通过增加推理时的计算开销优化序列问题，Mesa层为RNN模型提供了新的性能提升途径。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

Result: 稀疏注意力模型在低资源和高资源场景下均优于密集模型，AIME问题解决准确率提升显著。

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力是实现测试时扩展潜力的关键，代码已开源。

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer LLMs的推理成本受限于KV缓存大小，而非生成令牌数量，因此探索通过压缩KV缓存在相同计算预算下生成更多令牌以提高推理准确性。

Method: 引入动态内存稀疏化（DMS），一种新型KV缓存稀疏化方法，仅需1K训练步骤即可实现8倍压缩，同时保持比无训练稀疏注意力更高的准确性。

Result: 在多个LLM家族中验证了DMS的有效性，例如Qwen-R1 32B在AIME 24、GPQA和LiveCodeBench上平均提升9.1、7.6和9.6分。

Conclusion: DMS通过延迟令牌驱逐和隐式合并表示，显著提升了推理时超扩展的实用性，为高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

Conclusion: YOTO提供了一种高效的一次性训练方法，显著提升了损失权重优化的效率和性能。

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for
reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过双向边界（同时最大化下界和最小化上界）训练能量模型（EBMs）的方法，以解决传统方法的不稳定性问题，并展示了其在密度估计和样本生成中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能量模型（EBMs）虽然提供了优雅的无归一化密度估计框架，但训练过程通常困难且不稳定。传统方法通过极小化下界训练EBMs，但可能导致不稳定问题。

Method: 提出使用双向边界（最大化下界和最小化上界）训练EBMs。研究了四种不同的对数似然边界，包括基于生成器雅可比矩阵奇异值和互信息的下界，以及基于梯度惩罚和扩散过程的上界。

Result: 实验表明，双向边界方法显著稳定了EBMs的训练过程，并实现了高质量的密度估计和样本生成。

Conclusion: 双向边界方法为EBMs的训练提供了一种稳定且高效的解决方案，适用于实际应用中的密度估计和生成任务。

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

TL;DR: 本文通过类间特征归因的视角研究对抗训练（AT），发现跨类特征在AT中的作用，并揭示其在训练过程中的动态变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练（AT）是提高深度神经网络对抗攻击鲁棒性的有效方法，但其训练机制和动态仍待研究。本文旨在通过类间特征归因的视角深入理解AT。

Method: 通过合成数据模型和系统实验，研究跨类特征在AT中的作用及其动态变化。

Result: 研究发现，AT初期模型倾向于学习更多跨类特征，直至达到最佳鲁棒性；随后模型更依赖类特定特征，导致鲁棒过拟合。

Conclusion: 本文为AT机制提供了新视角，统一了软标签训练和鲁棒过拟合的现有属性，深化了对AT的理解。

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is
available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/Cross-Class-Features-AT.

TL;DR: 提出一种利用基于流的生成模型作为先验，对齐可学习潜在空间与目标分布的新框架。方法通过预训练流模型捕获目标分布，并通过对齐损失正则化潜在空间，避免了昂贵的似然评估和ODE求解。

Result: 实验证明对齐损失近似目标分布的负对数似然，并在ImageNet上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 框架为潜在空间对齐提供了新思路，兼具理论和实证支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的实时图像重建方法，用于解决地面太阳望远镜观测中由大气湍流引起的图像退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面太阳望远镜的高分辨率观测受到大气湍流的限制，传统重建方法在强湍流和高计算成本下表现不佳。

Method: 采用无配对图像到图像转换的深度学习模型，将100幅短曝光图像实时重建为一幅高质量图像，并以斑点重建作为参考。

Result: 该方法在感知质量上表现出更高的鲁棒性，尤其在斑点重建存在伪影时效果显著，且能充分利用图像序列信息。

Conclusion: 该方法在提供完整图像序列时能实现最佳重建效果，为太阳观测提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large aperture ground based solar telescopes allow the solar atmosphere to be
resolved in unprecedented detail. However, observations are limited by Earths
turbulent atmosphere, requiring post image corrections. Current reconstruction
methods using short exposure bursts face challenges with strong turbulence and
high computational costs. We introduce a deep learning approach that
reconstructs 100 short exposure images into one high quality image in real
time. Using unpaired image to image translation, our model is trained on
degraded bursts with speckle reconstructions as references, improving
robustness and generalization. Our method shows an improved robustness in terms
of perceptual quality, especially when speckle reconstructions show artifacts.
An evaluation with a varying number of images per burst demonstrates that our
method makes efficient use of the combined image information and achieves the
best reconstructions when provided with the full image burst.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种异步LLM代理，能够决定何时发言，并在在线Mafia游戏中表现与人类玩家相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的许多场景（如群聊、在线会议或社交游戏）是异步的，缺乏明确的轮流发言机制，因此需要LLM代理能够决定何时发言。

Method: 开发了一种自适应异步LLM代理，并在在线Mafia游戏中收集数据集进行测试。

Result: 代理在游戏表现和融入人类玩家方面与人类相当，发言时机行为接近人类，但消息内容存在差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM在真实人类群体环境中的应用铺平了道路，支持更现实的异步通信研究。

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

TL;DR: Exp4Fuse是一种新型融合排序框架，通过零样本LLM查询扩展提升稀疏检索性能，优于现有方法并达到SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM查询扩展方法依赖生成文档质量，成本高且计算复杂，需改进稀疏检索性能。

Method: 提出Exp4Fuse框架，结合原始查询和LLM增强查询的两条检索路径，通过改进的RRF方法融合结果。

Result: 在多个数据集上，Exp4Fuse超越现有LLM扩展方法，结合高级稀疏检索器达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse显著提升稀疏检索的查询扩展效果，具有高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

TL;DR: GOLFer是一种利用小型开源语言模型进行查询扩展的新方法，通过过滤生成文档中的幻觉内容并结合查询，性能优于其他小型模型方法，且与大型模型方法竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）用于查询扩展成本高且计算密集，小型模型生成的文档常存在幻觉问题，限制了其应用。GOLFer旨在解决这些问题。

Method: GOLFer包含两个模块：幻觉过滤器（检测并移除非事实和不一致的句子）和文档组合器（通过权重向量平衡查询与过滤内容）。

Result: 在三个网页搜索和十个低资源数据集上的实验表明，GOLFer优于其他小型模型方法，且与大型模型方法性能相当。

Conclusion: GOLFer为小型语言模型在查询扩展中的应用提供了高效且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ColPali/ColQwen2在VDR中表现优异，但每页生成多个嵌入导致内存占用过高，需优化以减少嵌入数量且性能损失最小。

Method: 评估了两种减少嵌入的策略：剪枝和合并。剪枝中随机方法表现最佳，但合并更适合VDR。通过三维合并策略优化，开发了Light-ColPali/ColQwen2。

Result: Light-ColPali/ColQwen2在保持98.2%检索性能的同时，内存使用降至11.8%；在2.8%内存占用下仍保留94.6%效果。

Conclusion: 研究为高效VDR提供了有价值的见解，Light-ColPali/ColQwen2为未来研究设立了竞争基准。

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

Result: 高相似性削弱护栏，低相似性使模型更鲁棒，危害分数降低10.33%。

Conclusion: 上游数据集设计对构建持久安全护栏至关重要，为微调服务提供商提供实用建议。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

Result: 模型能学习生成语音，但在控制可理解性和说话者身份一致性方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 未来需改进模型的可控性，以更好地完成语音重建任务。

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the
voice reconstruction task.

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often exhibit gender bias. However,
