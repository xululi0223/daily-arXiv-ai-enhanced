Aim to submit to IEEE TCAD", "summary": "Software-defined radio (SDR) plays an important role in the communication field by providing a flexible and customized communication system for different purposes according to the needs. To enhance the performance of SDR applications, hardware accelerators have been widely deployed in recent years. In facing this obstacle, a necessity arises for a high-level synthesis (HLS) tool specifically designed for communication engineers without detailed hardware knowledge. To lower the barrier between SDR engineers and hardware development, this work proposed a Python-based HLS tool, VeriPy, which can generate both mainstream architecture for hardware accelerators in Verilog specifically for SDR designs including unrolled design and pipelined design, requiring no detailed digital hardware knowledge or Hardware Description Languages (HDL). Furthermore, VeriPy supports automatic testbench generation with random input stimulus, an extensible hardware library, performance and resource estimation, and offers strong optimisation potential at both the algorithmic and digital hardware levels. The generated hardware design by VeriPy can achieve up to 70% faster operating frequency compared to pragma-optimised Vivado HLS designs with a reasonably higher resource con-sumption while delivering comparable performance and resource consumption to hand-coded implementations. Regarding code complexity, VeriPy requires no pragmas, completely eliminating the need for low-level hardware knowledge. For straightforward algorithms, the input code length remains comparable to that of Vivado HLS.", "AI": {"tldr": "VeriPy\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8ePython\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u7efc\u5408\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u786c\u4ef6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210Verilog\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8eVivado HLS\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u9700\u8981\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u4fe1\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7f3a\u4e4f\u786c\u4ef6\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u964d\u4f4e\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u95e8\u69db\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8ePython\u7684HLS\u5de5\u5177VeriPy\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5c55\u5f00\u5f0f\u548c\u5e73\u94fa\u5f0f\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u751f\u6210\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u786c\u4ef6\u5e93\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u8d44\u6e90\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u786c\u4ef6\u63cf\u8ff0\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "VeriPy\u751f\u6210\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6bd4pragma\u4f18\u5316\u7684Vivado HLS\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5feb70%\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5408\u7406\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u624b\u5de5\u7f16\u7801\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e14\u65e0\u9700pragmas\u3002", "conclusion": "VeriPy\u6210\u529f\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86SDR\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5c42\u9762\u90fd\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Although efficient sequential algorithms exist for this task, the scale of modern networks requires faster, multicore-ready approaches. To this end, we adapt a distributed $k$-core algorithm originally proposed by Montresor et al. to shared-memory systems and implement it in Rust, leveraging the language's strengths in concurrency and memory safety. We developed three progressively optimized versions: SequentialK as a baseline, ParallelK introducing multi-threaded message passing, and FastK further reducing synchronization overhead. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including road networks, web graphs, and social networks, show that FastK consistently outperforms both SequentialK and ParallelK, as well as a reference Python implementation available in the NetworkX library.

With the advent of generative AI various attempts have been made to automate parts of the design and verification process. Large language models (LLMs) as well as specialized models generate hdl and testbenches for small components, having a few leaf level components. However, there are only a few attempts to automate the entire processor design process. Hardware design demands hierarchical and modular design processes. We utilized this best practice systematically and effectively. We propose agentic automated processor design and verification with engineers in the loop. The agent with optional specification tries to break down the design into sub-components, generate HDL and cocotb tests, and verifies the components involving engineer guidance, especially during debugging and synthesis. We designed various digital systems using this approach. However, we selected two simple processors for demonstration purposes in this work. The first one is a LEGv8 like a simple processor verified, synthesized and programmed for the DE-10 Lite FPGA. The second one is a RISC-V like 32-bit processor designed and verified in similar manner and synthesized. However, it is not programmed into the DE-10 Lite. This process is accomplished usually using around a million inference tokens per processor, using a combination of reasoning (e.g gemini-pro) and non-reasoning models (eg. gpt-5-mini) based on the complexity of the task. This indicates that hardware design and verification experimentation can be done cost effectively without using any specialized hardware.

Heimdall, as a representative GPU-accelerated single-pulse search tool, offers substantial performance advantages over CPU-based approaches. However, its sequential execution model and resource contention in intermediate processing stages limit GPU utilization, leading to suboptimal throughput and increased computational latency. To address these limitations, we present Heimdall++, an optimized successor to Heimdall that incorporates fine-grained GPU parallelization, enhanced memory management, and a multi-threaded framework to decouple CPU-bound and GPU-bound processing stages.

However, once a device model is widely deployed, the performance of each device becomes different after a period of running. This is caused by the differences in user configurations, environmental conditions, manufacturing variances, battery degradation, etc. Existing DNN compression methods have not taken this scenario into consideration and can not guarantee good compression results in all homogeneous edge devices. To address this, we propose Homogeneous-Device Aware Pruning (HDAP), a hardware-aware DNN compression framework explicitly designed for homogeneous edge devices, aiming to achieve optimal average performance of the compressed model across all devices. To deal with the difficulty of time-consuming hardware-aware evaluations for thousands or millions of homogeneous edge devices, HDAP partitions all the devices into several device clusters, which can dramatically reduce the number of devices to evaluate and use the surrogate-based evaluation instead of hardware evaluation in real-time. Extensive experiments on multiple device types (Jetson Xavier NX and Jetson Nano) and task types (image classification with ResNet50, MobileNetV1, ResNet56, VGG16; object detection with YOLOv8n) demonstrate that HDAP consistently achieves lower average latency and competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant speedups (e.g., 2.86$\\times$ on ResNet50 at 1.0G FLOPs).

We present IslandRun, a multi-objective orchestration system that treats computational resources as autonomous \"islands\" spanning personal devices, private edge servers, and public cloud.

Within this broader landscape, Verilog, as a representative hardware description language (HDL), plays a fundamental role in digital circuit design and verification, making its automated generation particularly significant for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Consequently, recent research has increasingly focused on applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to Verilog code generation, particularly at the Register Transfer Level (RTL), exploring how these AI-driven techniques can be effectively integrated into hardware design workflows. Despite substantial research efforts have explored LLM applications in this domain, a comprehensive survey synthesizing these developments remains absent from the literature. This review fill addresses this gap by providing a systematic literature review of LLM-based methods for Verilog code generation, examining their effectiveness, limitations, and potential for advancing automated hardware design. The review encompasses research work from conferences and journals in the fields of SE, AI, and EDA, encompassing 70 papers published on venues, along with 32 high-quality preprint papers, bringing the total to 102 papers. By answering four key research questions, we aim to (1) identify the LLMs used for Verilog generation, (2) examine the datasets and metrics employed in evaluation, (3) categorize the techniques proposed for Verilog generation, and (4) analyze LLM alignment approaches for Verilog generation. Based on our findings, we have identified a series of limitations of existing studies. Finally, we have outlined a roadmap highlighting potential opportunities for future research endeavors in LLM-assisted hardware design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u662f\u5173\u4e8eLLM\u5728Verilog\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86102\u7bc7\u76f8\u5173\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "Verilog\u4f5c\u4e3a\u786c\u4ef6\u63cf\u8ff0\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cLLM\u5728Verilog\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7efc\u8ff0\u6765\u603b\u7ed3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fdb\u5c55\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\u3001\u5206\u6790\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u4e86SE\u3001AI\u548cEDA\u9886\u57df\u768470\u7bc7\u4f1a\u8bae/\u671f\u520a\u8bba\u6587\u548c32\u7bc7\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u5370\u672c\uff0c\u5171\u8ba1102\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u7b54\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5206\u6790\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u7684LLM\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1b3) Verilog\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b4) Verilog\u751f\u6210\u7684LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5404\u79cdLLM\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5bf9Verilog\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7efc\u8ff0\u586b\u8865\u4e86LLM\u5728Verilog\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7efc\u8ff0\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u72b6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

These networks face unique challenges due to UAVs high mobility, limited energy resources, and dynamic topology. In this work, we propose a novel multi-hop clustering algorithm aimed at creating stable, energy-efficient clusters in FANET environments. The proposed solution enhances cluster longevity and communication efficiency through mobility-aware clustering, energy-centric cluster head (CH) selection, and a ground station(GS)-assisted cluster maintenance management mechanism. First, steady multi-hop clusters are constructed, having CHs with not only high stability and high energy but also with steady and high-energy neighboring areas, and then a proper GS-assisted cluster maintenance mechanism is applied. Experimental results, based on extended simulations, demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing schemes significantly, in terms of cluster stability, communication overhead, and security resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eFANET\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u8df3\u5206\u7c07\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7c07\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7c07\u5934\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5730\u9762\u7ad9\u8f85\u52a9\u7ef4\u62a4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u96c6\u7fa4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u6548", "motivation": "FANET\u7531\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u3001\u6709\u9650\u80fd\u91cf\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u62d3\u6251\u7b49\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u80fd\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u7c07\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7c07\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7c07\u5934\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5730\u9762\u7ad9\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u96c6\u7fa4\u7ef4\u62a4\u7ba1\u7406\u673a\u5236", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u96c6\u7fa4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5f39\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u5206\u7c07\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9FANET\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u6548"}}

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on deductive methods with predefined labels, this research investigates the inductive process where labels emerge from the data. The study evaluates the performance of six open-source LLMs compared to human experts. As part of the evaluation, experts rated the perceived difficulty of the quotes they coded. The results reveal a peculiar dichotomy: human coders consistently perform well when labeling complex sentences but struggle with simpler ones, while LLMs exhibit the opposite trend. Additionally, the study explores systematic deviations in both human and LLM generated labels by comparing them to the golden standard from the test set. While human annotations may sometimes differ from the golden standard, they are often rated more favorably by other humans. In contrast, some LLMs demonstrate closer alignment with the true labels but receive lower evaluations from experts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u7eb3\u5f0f\u5b9a\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u590d\u6742\u53e5\u5b50\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u4f46\u7b80\u5355\u53e5\u5b50\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff0c\u800cLLMs\u5219\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u4e14\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0e\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u540c\u4f46\u66f4\u53d7\u4e13\u5bb6\u597d\u8bc4", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9a\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4f9d\u8d56\u6f14\u7ece\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u7eb3\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6807\u7b7e\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u516d\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u96be\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5947\u7279\u4e8c\u5206\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u7801\u8005\u5728\u590d\u6742\u53e5\u5b50\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u826f\u597d\u4f46\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u53e5\u5b50\u4e0a\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u800cLLMs\u5219\u5448\u73b0\u76f8\u53cd\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u867d\u4e0e\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u540c\u4f46\u66f4\u53d7\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u7c7b\u597d\u8bc4\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9bLLMs\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f46\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8f83\u4f4e", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b9a\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf"}}

Embedded solutions such as fall detection, rehabilitation tracking, and patient supervision require fast and efficient tracking of movements while avoiding unwanted false alarms. This study presents an efficient solution on how to build very efficient motion-based models only using triaxial accelerometer sensors. We explore the capability of the AutoML pipelines to extract the most important features from the data segments. This approach also involves training multiple lightweight machine learning algorithms using the extracted features.

Phase-change memory (PCM) has gained attention as a promising option due to its scalability, fast access speeds, and zero leakage power compared to conventional memory systems. However, despite these advantages, PCM faces several challenges that impede its broader adoption, particularly its limited lifespan due to material degradation during write operations, as well as the high energy demands of these processes. For PCM to become a viable storage alternative, enhancing its endurance and reducing the energy required for write operations are essential. This paper proposes the use of a neural network (NN) model to predict critical parameters such as write latency, energy consumption, and endurance by monitoring real-time operating conditions and device characteristics. These predictions are key to improving PCM performance and identifying optimal write settings, making PCM a more practical and efficient option for data storage in applications with frequent write operations.

Their runtime-dependent transition probabilities break down the pre-computation strategy that underpins most existing CPU and GPU static random walk optimizations. This leaves practitioners suffering from suboptimal frameworks and having to write hand-tuned kernels that do not adapt to workload diversity. To handle this issue, we present FlexiWalker, the first GPU framework that delivers efficient, workload-generic support for dynamic random walks. Our design-space study shows that rejection sampling and reservoir sampling are more suitable than other sampling techniques under massive parallelism. Thus, we devise (i) new high-performance kernels for them that eliminate global reductions, redundant memory accesses, and random-number generation. Given the necessity of choosing the best-fitting sampling strategy at runtime, we adopt (ii) a lightweight first-order cost model that selects the faster kernel per node at runtime. To enhance usability, we introduce (iii) a compile-time component that automatically specializes user-supplied walk logic into optimized building blocks. On various dynamic random walk workloads with real-world graphs, FlexiWalker outperforms the best published CPU/GPU baselines by geometric means of 73.44x and 5.91x, respectively, while successfully executing workloads that prior systems cannot support.

We simulate 7500 multi-agent, multi-round discussions in an inductive coding task, generating over 125000 utterances that capture both final annotations and their interactional histories. We introduce process-level metrics: code stability, semantic self-consistency, and lexical confidence alongside sentiment and convergence measures, to track coordination dynamics. To probe deeper alignment signals, we analyze the evolving geometry of output embeddings, showing that intrinsic dimensionality declines over rounds, suggesting semantic compression. The results reveal that LLM groups converge lexically and semantically, develop asymmetric influence patterns, and exhibit negotiation-like behaviors despite the absence of explicit role prompting. This work demonstrates how black-box interaction analysis can surface emergent coordination strategies, offering a scalable complement to internal probe-based interpretability methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df7500\u6b21\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790LLM\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u89d2\u8272\u63d0\u793a\uff0cLLM\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e5f\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8c08\u5224\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65f6\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76LLM\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5f52\u7eb3\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df7500\u6b21\u591a\u8f6e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u8fc7125000\u6761\u8bdd\u8bed\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\uff08\u4ee3\u7801\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u8f93\u51fa\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6f14\u5316\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "LLM\u7fa4\u4f53\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8c08\u5224\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8f93\u51fa\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u968f\u8f6e\u6b21\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8bed\u4e49\u538b\u7f29\u53d1\u751f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ed1\u76d2\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793aLLM\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8865\u5145\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, like any digital circuit, these processors are prone to faults induced by radiation particles such as heavy ions, protons, etc., making their use in harsh radiation environments a challenge. This work presents an in-depth analysis of the impact of such faults on the computational pipeline of a Systolic Array based Deep Neural Network accelerator (SA-DNN accelerator) by means of a Register Transfer Level (RTL) Fault Injection (FI) simulation in order to improve the observability of each hardware block. From this analysis, we present the sensitivity to single bit faults of register groups in the pipeline for three different DNN workloads utilising two datasets, namely MNIST and CIFAR-10. These sensitivity figures are presented in terms of Fault Propagation Probability ($P(f_{non-crit})$) and False Classification Probability ($P(f_{crit})$) which respectively show the probability that an injected fault causes a non-critical error (numerical offset) or a critical error (classification fault).

This creates a structural holdout: sampling neither expands with TP nor balances across PP stages, so its share of iteration time grows as GPUs get faster and it caps pipeline frequency at the last stage. We present SIMPLE, a stage-agnostic, sequence-parallel, overlappable decision plane that disaggregates sampling into a CPU-side service and shrinks its runtime footprint back to a minor, hidden role. SIMPLE combines: (1) sequence-parallel sampling, which shards work along the batch dimension and removes vocabulary-axis collectives; (2) a CPU-based algorithm with column-wise penalties and truncation-first filtering to realize single-pass, linear-time kernels; and (3) speculative hot-vocab sampling (SHVS), which samples on a small hot set with rejection-correctness and uses a simple sizing model to choose the hot-vocab size that maximizes throughput. In evaluation, SIMPLE improves end-to-end throughput by up to 96% and reduces P95 latency by 20-65%. Crucially, SIMPLE requires no user-side code changes and composes with existing data-plane optimizations, unlocking scaling benefits that compound with future GPU generations.", "AI": {"tldr": "SIMPLE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u91c7\u6837\u8ba1\u7b97\u5378\u8f7d\u5230CPU\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u63a8\u6d4b\u6027\u70ed\u8bcd\u6c47\u91c7\u6837\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5f20\u91cf\u5e76\u884c\u548c\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5e76\u884c\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u9762\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u529b/GEMM\u548cKV\u7f13\u5b58\uff09\u5df2\u5f97\u5230\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u91c7\u6837\uff08\u5c06logits\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3atokens\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u5e73\u9762\uff09\u6210\u4e3a\u65b0\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u91c7\u6837\u65e2\u4e0d\u80fd\u968fTP\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u80fd\u5728PP\u9636\u6bb5\u95f4\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u5360\u8fed\u4ee3\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u968fGPU\u52a0\u901f\u800c\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u9891\u7387\u3002", "method": "SIMPLE\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u6280\u672f\uff1a1\uff09\u5e8f\u5217\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6cbf\u6279\u6b21\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u7247\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e76\u79fb\u9664\u8bcd\u6c47\u8f74\u96c6\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eCPU\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5217\u5f0f\u60e9\u7f5a\u548c\u622a\u65ad\u4f18\u5148\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u6838\uff1b3\uff09\u63a8\u6d4b\u6027\u70ed\u8bcd\u6c47\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u70ed\u96c6\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u62d2\u7edd\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5927\u5316\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7684\u70ed\u8bcd\u6c47\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "result": "SIMPLE\u5c06\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe96%\uff0cP95\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e20-65%\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u9700\u7528\u6237\u7aef\u4ee3\u7801\u66f4\u6539\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u9762\u4f18\u5316\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u9501\u968f\u672a\u6765GPU\u4e16\u4ee3\u590d\u5408\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "SIMPLE\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u91c7\u6837\u89e3\u8026\u4e3aCPU\u7aef\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6062\u590d\u4e3a\u6b21\u8981\u3001\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u786c\u4ef6\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

These models take in sentences as a sequence of tokens, and learn to encode the meaning of the sequence into embeddings such that those embeddings can be used reliably for NLI tasks. Essentially, every word is considered against every other word in the sequence, and the transformer model is able to determine the relationships between them, entirely from scratch. However, a model that accepts explicit linguistic structures like dependency parse trees may be able to leverage prior encoded information about these relationships, without having to learn them from scratch, thus improving learning efficiency. To investigate this, we adapt Graph Matching Networks (GMN) to operate on dependency parse trees, creating Tree Matching Networks (TMN). We compare TMN to a BERT based model on the SNLI entailment task and on the SemEval similarity task. TMN is able to achieve significantly better results with a significantly reduced memory footprint and much less training time than the BERT based model on the SNLI task, while both models struggled to preform well on the SemEval. Explicit structural representations significantly outperform sequence-based models at comparable scales, but current aggregation methods limit scalability.

By unifying the system's cost model across software and hardware, the compiler achieves significant improvements in Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) metrics compared to standard off-the-shelf components and hand-designed chips through five key innovations: (1) a multi-algorithm auto-tuning framework with five search strategies (Bayesian Optimization, Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Random Search, Grid Search) combined with a learned cost model, (2) an integrated quantization framework supporting extreme precisions from FP32 to Binary with full KL divergence calibration (2048-bin histogram optimization) and momentum-based QAT gradient updates, (3) hardware-aware validation ensuring 100 percent ISA compliance and memory constraint satisfaction, (4) dynamic shape support with multi-configuration specialization, and (5) advanced cache-aware cost modeling with multi-level cache hierarchy analysis.

Similarly to the push originating from the RISC-V movement for CPUs, Vortex can enable a myriad of fresh research directions for GPUs. However, as a young hardware platform, it currently lacks the performance competitiveness of commercial GPUs, which is crucial for widespread adoption. State-of-the-art GPUs, in fact, rely on complex architectural features, still unavailable in Vortex, to hide the micro-code overheads linked to control flow (CF) management and memory orchestration for data access. In particular, these components account for the majority of the dynamic instruction count in regular, memory-intensive kernels, such as linear algebra routines, which form the basis of many applications, including Machine Learning. To address these challenges with simple yet powerful micro-architecture modifications, this paper introduces decoupled CF and data access through 1.) a hardware CF manager to accelerate branching and predication in regular loop execution and 2.) decoupled memory streaming lanes to further hide memory latency with useful computation. The evaluation results for different kernels show 8$\\times$ faster execution, 10$\\times$ reduction in dynamic instruction count, and overall performance improvement from 0.35 to 1.63 $\\mathrm{GFLOP/s/mm^2}$.

Decoding follows a deterministic, constraint-aware procedure with a lightweight normaliser that encourages minimal, meaning-preserving edits. We operationalise inference, subsequent to instruction fine-tuning (IFT), via a fixed, language-specific prompt directly synthesised from a deterministic error classifier's taxonomy, label distributions, and precedence ordering computed on the training corpus.\n  Under the official untuned GLEU evaluation, the system scores 92.41 on Malayalam, sixth overall, and 81.44 on Hindi, third overall.

While deep-learning models for image segmentation, such as U-Net-based baselines and change-detection models, are useful baselines, they often struggle with subtle structural variations and severe class imbalance, yielding poor detection of highly damaged regions. The present work proposes a deep-learning framework that jointly processes pre- and post-disaster satellite images to obtain fine-grained pixel-level damage maps: Satellite-to-Street: Disaster Impact Estimator. The model uses a modified dual-input U-Net architecture with enhanced feature fusion to capture both the local structural changes as well as the broader contextual cues. Class-aware weighted loss functions are integrated in order to handle the dominance of undamaged pixels in real disaster datasets, thus enhancing sensitivity toward major and destroyed categories. Experimentation on publicly available disaster datasets shows improved localization and classification of structural damage when compared to traditional segmentation and baseline change-detection models. The resulting damage maps provide a rapid and consistent assessment mechanism to support and not replace expert decision-making, thus allowing more efficient, data-driven disaster management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSatellite-to-Street\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u53cc\u8f93\u5165U-Net\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u52a0\u6743\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u7ec6\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u707e\u5bb3\u635f\u5bb3\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u574f\u533a\u57df\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u89e3\u91ca\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3001\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982U-Net\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7ec6\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u635f\u574f\u533a\u57df\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSatellite-to-Street\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u53cc\u8f93\u5165U-Net\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b2\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u52a0\u6743\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u707e\u5bb3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u672a\u635f\u574f\u50cf\u7d20\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u4e3b\u8981\u635f\u574f\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u635f\u574f\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u707e\u5bb3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u635f\u574f\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u635f\u5bb3\u5730\u56fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u652f\u6301\u800c\u975e\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e13\u5bb6\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u707e\u5bb3\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

WebAssembly (WASM), originally designed for the web, is increasingly recognized as a portable, secure and efficient runtime environment that can overcome these challenges. This paper explores the feasibility of using WASM in embedded IoT systems by evaluating its performance, memory footprint and energy consumption on three representative microcontrollers: the Raspberry Pi Pico, the ESP32 C6 and the nRF5340. Two lightweight WASM runtimes, WAMR and wasm3, are compared with the native C execution. The results show that while the native execution remains superior in terms of speed and energy efficiency, WASM offers acceptable trade-offs in return for cross-platform compatibility and sandbox execution. The results highlight that WASM is a viable option for embedded IoT applications when portability and security outweigh strict performance constraints, and that further runtime optimization could extend its practicality in this area.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86WebAssembly\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86WASM\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4e0e\u539f\u751fC\u6267\u884c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0WASM\u5728\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u7ed9\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002WebAssembly\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08Raspberry Pi Pico\u3001ESP32 C6\u548cnRF5340\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30WASM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7WASM\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff08WAMR\u548cwasm3\uff09\u4e0e\u539f\u751fC\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u867d\u7136\u539f\u751fC\u6267\u884c\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5360\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46WASM\u5728\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u6c99\u7bb1\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002WASM\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4f18\u5148\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u6027\u80fd\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\uff0cWASM\u662f\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u9009\u9879\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, cold-start latency, especially the model loading phase, has become a critical performance bottleneck, as it scales linearly with model size and severely limits the practical deployment of large-scale LLM services. This paper presents Tangram, a novel system that accelerates Serverless LLM loading through efficient GPU memory reuse. By leveraging the unused GPU memory to retain model parameters, Tangram significantly reduces model transfer time and cold-start latency. Its design includes three key components: unified GPU memory pool for tensor-level parameter sharing across models, on-demand KV cache allocation for dynamic memory management, and GPU-affinity-aware scheduling for maximizing resource utilization. These techniques collectively address the critical challenges of inefficient memory usage and the cold-start problem in Serverless LLM platforms. We have implemented a fully functional prototype, and experiments show that Tangram achieves up to 6.2 times faster loading and reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) during cold-start by 23--55% over state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Tangram\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7GPU\u5185\u5b58\u590d\u7528\u52a0\u901fServerless LLM\u52a0\u8f7d\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u8f7d\u901f\u5ea66.2\u500d\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u9996\u6b21\u4ee4\u724c\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f423-55%", "motivation": "Serverless LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u8f7d\u9636\u6bb5\uff09\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72", "method": "Tangram\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u7edf\u4e00GPU\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5f20\u91cf\u7ea7\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u3001\u6309\u9700KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u3001GPU\u4eb2\u548c\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aTangram\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe6.2\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u8f7d\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u671f\u95f4\u9996\u6b21\u4ee4\u724c\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1123-55%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "Tangram\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u590d\u7528\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Serverless LLM\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u670d\u52a1\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

However, these models can be only used in cascaded pipelines for speech translation (ST), performing automatic speech recognition first followed by translation. This introduces additional latency, which is particularly critical in simultaneous ST (SimulST), and prevents the model from exploiting multimodal context, such as images, which can aid disambiguation. Pretrained multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) already possess strong perception and reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities, but generally lack the multilingual coverage and specialized translation performance of dedicated translation LLMs. To build an effective multimodal translation system, we propose an end-to-end approach that fuses MMFMs with translation LLMs. We introduce a novel fusion strategy that connects hidden states from multiple layers of a pretrained MMFM to a translation LLM, enabling joint end-to-end training. The resulting model, OmniFusion, built on Omni 2.5-7B as the MMFM and SeedX PPO-7B as the translation LLM, can perform speech-to-text, speech-and-image-to-text, and text-and-image-to-text translation. Experiments demonstrate that OmniFusion effectively leverages both audio and visual inputs, achieves a 1-second latency reduction in SimulST compared to cascaded pipelines and also improves the overall translation quality\\footnote{Code is available at https://github.com/saikoneru/OmniFusion}.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniFusion\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e13\u7528LLM\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7ea7\u8054\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u6587\u672c\u7ffb\u8bd1LLM\u53ea\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e\u7ea7\u8054\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u989d\u5916\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08\u5bf9\u540c\u58f0\u4f20\u8bd1\u7279\u522b\u5173\u952e\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u6b67\u3002\u800c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7ffb\u8bd1LLM\u878d\u5408\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3MMFM\u591a\u4e2a\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u8fde\u63a5\u5230\u7ffb\u8bd1LLM\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8054\u5408\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u57fa\u4e8eOmni 2.5-7B\u4f5c\u4e3aMMFM\uff0cSeedX PPO-7B\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ffb\u8bd1LLM\u6784\u5efaOmniFusion\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "OmniFusion\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u58f0\u4f20\u8bd1\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u7ea7\u8054\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u51cf\u5c111\u79d2\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u8bed\u97f3\u5230\u6587\u672c\u3001\u8bed\u97f3+\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6587\u672c\u3001\u6587\u672c+\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6587\u672c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e13\u7528LLM\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ea7\u8054\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This paper focuses on creating a pipeline aimed at dealing with such noise while at the same time maintaining the accuracy of provident vehicular detection. The pipeline in this paper, ProvRain, uses a lightweight MobileNet-U-Net architecture tuned to generalize to robust weather conditions by using the concept of curricula training. A mix of synthetic as well as available data from the PVDN dataset is used for this. This pipeline is compared to the base Faster RCNN architecture trained on the PVDN dataset to see how much the addition of a denoising architecture helps increase the detection model's performance in rainy conditions. The system boasts an 8.94\\% increase in accuracy and a 10.25\\% increase in recall in the detection of vehicles in rainy night time frames.

As FPGA designs scale and heterogeneous resources increase, dense interconnects introduce significant resistive and capacitive effects, making timing closure increasingly difficult. Existing methods face challenges in constructing accurate timing models due to multi-factor nonlinear constraints as well as load and crosstalk coupling effects arising in multi-pin driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose TD-Placer, a critical path aware, timing-driven global placement framework. It leverages graph-based representations to capture global net interactions and employs a nonlinear model to integrate diverse timing-related features for precise delay prediction, thereby improving the overall placement quality for FPGAs. TD-Placer adopts a quadratic placement objective that minimizes wirelength while incorporating a timing term constructed by a lightweight algorithm, enabling efficient and high-quality timing optimization. Regarding net-level timing contention, it also employs a finer-grained weighting scheme to facilitate smooth reduction of the Critical Path Delay (CPD). Extensive experiments were carried out on seven real-world open-source FPGA projects with LUT counts ranging from 60K to 400K. The results demonstrate that TD-Placer achieves an average 10% improvement in Worst Negative Slack (WNS) and a 5% reduction in CPD compared to the state-of-the-art method, with an average CPD comparable (*1.01) to the commercial AMD Vivado across five versions (2020.2-2024.2).

With the advent of powerful devices in the network edge, Gossip Learning further decentralizes Federated Learning by removing centralized integration and relying fully on peer to peer updates. However, the averaging methods generally used in both Federated and Gossip Learning are not ideal for model accuracy and global convergence. Additionally, there are few options to deploy Learning workloads in the edge as part of a larger application using a declarative approach such as Kubernetes manifests. This paper proposes Delta Sum Learning as a method to improve the basic aggregation operation in Gossip Learning, and implements it in a decentralized orchestration framework based on Open Application Model, which allows for dynamic node discovery and intent-driven deployment of multi-workload applications. Evaluation results show that Delta Sum performance is on par with alternative integration methods for 10 node topologies, but results in a 58% lower global accuracy drop when scaling to 50 nodes. Overall, it shows strong global convergence and a logarithmic loss of accuracy with increasing topology size compared to a linear loss for alternatives under limited connectivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDelta Sum Learning\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdbGossip Learning\u4e2d\u7684\u805a\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eOpen Application Model\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7f16\u6392\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8282\u70b9\u62d3\u6251\u4e0b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u548cGossip Learning\u4e2d\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u4e14\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u805a\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7f16\u6392\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDelta Sum Learning\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdbGossip Learning\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u805a\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eOpen Application Model\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7f16\u6392\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u8282\u70b9\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5e94\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u8282\u70b9\u62d3\u6251\u4e2dDelta Sum\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u523050\u8282\u70b9\u65f6\u5168\u5c40\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u51cf\u5c1158%\u3002Delta Sum\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0b\u968f\u62d3\u6251\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u635f\u5931\u5448\u5bf9\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u800c\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u3002", "conclusion": "Delta Sum Learning\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86Gossip Learning\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7f16\u6392\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Their ability to understand mood states in other languages is unclear, as different languages have their own idioms of distress. Aim: To quantify the ability of language models to faithfully represent phrases (idioms of distress) of four distinct mood states (depression, euthymia, euphoric mania, dysphoric mania) expressed in Indian languages. Methods: We collected 247 unique phrases for the four mood states across 11 Indic languages. We tested seven experimental conditions, comparing k-means clustering performance on: (a) direct embeddings of native and Romanised scripts (using multilingual and Indic-specific models) and (b) embeddings of phrases translated to English and Chinese. Performance was measured using a composite score based on Adjusted Rand Index, Normalised Mutual Information, Homogeneity and Completeness. Results: Direct embedding of Indic languages failed to cluster mood states (Composite Score = 0.002). All translation-based approaches showed significant improvement. High performance was achieved using Gemini-translated English (Composite=0.60) and human-translated English (Composite=0.61) embedded with gemini-001. Surprisingly, human-translated English, further translated into Chinese and embedded with a Chinese model, performed best (Composite = 0.67). Specialised Indic models (IndicBERT and Sarvam-M) performed poorly. Conclusion: Current models cannot meaningfully represent mood states directly from Indic languages, posing a fundamental barrier to their psychiatric application for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes in India. While high-quality translation bridges this gap, reliance on proprietary models or complex translation pipelines is unsustainable. Models must first be built to understand diverse local languages to be effective in global mental health.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u60c5\u7eea\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5230\u4e2d\u6587\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u805a\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672c\u5730\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u5b66\u4e2d\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u6709\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u75db\u82e6\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7406\u89e3\u60c5\u7eea\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u4e8611\u79cd\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u7684247\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u77ed\u8bed\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u56db\u79cd\u60c5\u7eea\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e03\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\uff1a1) \u539f\u751f\u548c\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u811a\u672c\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b2) \u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u4e2d\u6587\u540e\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c03\u6574\u5170\u5fb7\u6307\u6570\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u5206\u8861\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u8d25\uff08\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u5206=0.002\uff09\u3002\u6240\u6709\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\uff1aGemini\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u82f1\u8bed\uff080.60\uff09\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u82f1\u8bed\uff080.61\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002\u6700\u4f73\u8868\u73b0\u662f\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u82f1\u8bed\u518d\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u4e2d\u6587\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u6587\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\uff080.67\uff09\u3002\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5370\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5f88\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u5730\u8868\u793a\u60c5\u7eea\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u6839\u672c\u969c\u788d\u3002\u867d\u7136\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u590d\u6742\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5fc5\u987b\u9996\u5148\u5efa\u7acb\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u672c\u5730\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u5728\u5168\u7403\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Although these techniques significantly enhance creative possibilities, they also pose substantial risks related to intellectual property violations, including unauthorized identity cloning and stylistic imitation. To counter such threats, this work presents Adapter Shield, the first universal and authentication-integrated solution aimed at defending personal images from misuse in zero-shot generation scenarios. We first investigate how current zero-shot methods employ image encoders to extract embeddings from input images, which are subsequently fed into the UNet of diffusion models through cross-attention layers. Inspired by this mechanism, we construct a reversible encryption system that maps original embeddings into distinct encrypted representations according to different secret keys. The authorized users can restore the authentic embeddings via a decryption module and the correct key, enabling normal usage for authorized generation tasks. For protection purposes, we design a multi-target adversarial perturbation method that actively shifts the original embeddings toward designated encrypted patterns. Consequently, protected images are embedded with a defensive layer that ensures unauthorized users can only produce distorted or encrypted outputs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art defenses in blocking unauthorized zero-shot image synthesis, while supporting flexible and secure access control for verified users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAdapter Shield\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u96c6\u6210\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9632\u5fa1\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u514b\u9686\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u6a21\u4eff\u6ee5\u7528", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u4e00\u5f20\u8096\u50cf\u6216\u827a\u672f\u54c1\u5c31\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u590d\u5236\u6216\u98ce\u683c\u6a21\u4eff\u3002\u8fd9\u867d\u7136\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u521b\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fb5\u6743\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u514b\u9686\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u6a21\u4eff\u3002", "method": "1. \u7814\u7a76\u5f53\u524d\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u8f93\u5165\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bUNet\uff1b2. \u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9006\u52a0\u5bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u5d4c\u5165\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u540c\u5bc6\u94a5\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u8868\u793a\uff1b3. \u6388\u6743\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u5bc6\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u5bc6\u94a5\u6062\u590d\u539f\u59cb\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b4. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u6a21\u5f0f\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4f7f\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u56fe\u50cf\u53ea\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u626d\u66f2\u6216\u52a0\u5bc6\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u963b\u6b62\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f9b\u5df2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7528\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "Adapter Shield\u4e3a\u4e2a\u4eba\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6ee5\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u521b\u4f5c\u81ea\u7531\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

SetupKit integrates three key innovations: BEIRA, a bias-enhanced interpolation search derived from statistical error modeling to accelerate convergence by overcoming stagnation issues, initial search interval estimation by circuit analysis and AL strategy using Gaussian Process. This AL component intelligently learns PVT-timing correlations, actively guiding the expensive simulations to the most informative corners, thus minimizing redundancy in multicorner characterization. Evaluated on industrial 22nm standard cells across 16 PVT corners, SetupKit demonstrates a significant 2.4x overall CPU time reduction (from 720 to 290 days on a single core) compared to standard practices, drastically cutting characterization time. SetupKit offers a principled, learningbased approach to library characterization, addressing a critical EDA challenge and paving the way for more intelligent simulation management.", "AI": {"tldr": "SetupKit\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5e93\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7BEIRA\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u521d\u59cb\u641c\u7d22\u533a\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u591aPVT\u89d2\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b02.4\u500d\u52a0\u901f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u82af\u7247\u65f6\u5e8f\u6536\u655b\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5efa\u7acb/\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u6b21SPICE\u4eff\u771f\u5728\u4e0d\u540cPVT\u89d2\u4e0b\u9020\u6210\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u6301\u7eed\u6570\u5468\u6216\u6570\u6708\uff09\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u6162\u4e14\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u89d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSetupKit\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1) BEIRA\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u504f\u7f6e\u589e\u5f3a\u63d2\u503c\u641c\u7d22\uff09\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u521d\u59cb\u641c\u7d22\u533a\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60PVT-\u65f6\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\u6602\u8d35\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u6700\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u89d2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a22nm\u6807\u51c6\u5355\u5143\u4e0a\u8de816\u4e2aPVT\u89d2\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cSetupKit\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u5b9e\u8df5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e862.4\u500d\u6574\u4f53CPU\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\uff08\u4ece720\u5929\u964d\u81f3290\u5929\u5355\u6838\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77ed\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "SetupKit\u4e3a\u5e93\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u539f\u7406\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684EDA\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u7ba1\u7406\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

As graphs get larger, the irregular access patterns exhibited in most graph algorithms, hamper performance. This, along with NUMA and physical memory limits, results in scaling complexities with sequential/shared memory frameworks. StarPlat's MPI backend abstracts away the programmatic complexity involved in designing optimal distributed graph algorithms. It provides an instrument for coding graph algorithms that scale over distributed memory. In this work, we provide an analysis-transformation framework that leverages general semantics associated with iterations involving nodes and their neighbors, within StarPlat, to aggregate communication. The framework scans for patterns that warrant re-ordering in neighborhood access patterns, aggregate communication, and avoid communication altogether with opportunistic caching in reduction constructs. We also architect an optimized bulk-reduction substrate using Open MPI's passive Remote Memory Access (RMA) constructs.

We evaluate 14 leading LLMs under both zero-shot and few-shot settings, revealing that while models perform well on factual tasks, they struggle with classroom dialogue classification and exhibit inconsistent results in creative content generation.

Experiments with YOLOv8, YOLOv9 and RT-DETR reveal that training with synthetic data can achieve improved detection accuracies (at minimal costs).

Our findings suggest that diffusion-based synthetic data generation is a promising avenue for augmenting real datasets in microscopy image analysis, reducing the reliance on extensive manual annotation and potentially improving the robustness of cell detection models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u660e\u573a\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u80de\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u660e\u573a\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u74f6\u9888\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eU-Net\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u660e\u573a\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e0d\u540c\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528YOLOv8\u3001YOLOv9\u548cRT-DETR\u4e09\u79cd\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\uff09\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u8c03\u67e5\u663e\u793a\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u738750%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u662f\u589e\u5f3a\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ec6\u80de\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

This study aims to identify the best-performing model across diverse datasets without additional fine-tuning. It is valuable for practical applications where the need to retrain models for specific datasets is minimized, streamlining the implementation of these models in various contexts. The best-performing models were trained on the SQuAD v2 or SQuAD v1 datasets. The best-performing model was ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512, which yielded 43\\% accuracy across all datasets. We observed that the computation time of all models depends on the context length and the model size. The model's performance usually decreases with an increase in the answer length. Moreover, the model's performance depends on the context complexity. We also used the Genetic algorithm to improve the overall accuracy by integrating responses from other models. ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512 generated the best results for bioasq10b-factoid (65.92\\%), biomedical\\_cpgQA (96.45\\%), QuAC (11.13\\%), and Question Answer Dataset (41.6\\%).

While robust in predefined sections, this design lacks flexibility for unknown geometries and obstacles. This paper explores deep visual stereo odometry (DVSO) with 3D-geometric constraints as a focused alternative. DVSO is purely vision-based, leveraging stereo disparity, optical flow, and self-supervised learning to jointly estimate depth and ego-motion without labeled data. For global consistency, DVSO can subsequently be fused with absolute references (e.g., landmarks) or other sensors. We provide a conceptual evaluation for accelerator tunnel environments, using the European XFEL as a case study. Expected benefits include reduced scale drift via stereo, low-cost sensing, and scalable data collection, while challenges remain in low-texture surfaces, lighting variability, computational load, and robustness under radiation.

A growing number of such applications require a streamlined architecture for their effective execution, often comprising a single edge device with sensing capabilities, a single hub device (e.g., a laptop or smartphone) for managing and assisting the edge device, and a more computationally capable cloud server. Typical examples include the utilization of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for critical infrastructure inspection or a wearable biomedical device (e.g., a smartwatch) for remote patient monitoring. Task allocation in this streamlined architecture is particularly challenging, due to the computational, communication, and energy limitations of the devices at the network edge. Consequently, there is a need for a comprehensive framework that can address the specific task allocation problem optimally and efficiently. To this end, we propose a complete, binary integer linear programming (BILP) based formulation for an application-driven design-time approach, capable of providing an optimal task allocation in the targeted edge/hub/cloud environment. The proposed method minimizes the desired objective, either the overall latency or overall energy consumption, while considering several crucial parameters and constraints often overlooked in related literature. We evaluate our framework using a real-world use-case scenario, as well as appropriate synthetic benchmarks. Our extensive experimentation reveals that the proposed approach yields optimal and scalable results, enabling efficient design space exploration for different applications and computational devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eBILP\u7684\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18/\u67a2\u7ebd/\u4e91\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8fb9\u7f18/\u67a2\u7ebd/\u4e91\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08BILP\uff09\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e94\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u4f8b\u573a\u666f\u548c\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u4f18\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684BILP\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18/\u67a2\u7ebd/\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u80fd\u8017\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The decision tree revealed that models prioritize visual design elements (badge clutter: 38.6\\% importance) while humans emphasize content similarity, suggesting partial alignment in reasoning patterns. Failure case analysis reveals persistent challenges in MLLM visual perception, particularly for product similarity and color intensity assessment. Our findings indicate that diagnostic prompting represents a promising initial step toward human-aligned MLLM-based evaluation, though failure cases with consistent human-MLLM disagreement require continued research and refinement in prompting approaches with larger ground truth datasets for reliable practical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u9875\u89c6\u89c9\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u4ece0.031\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.297\uff0c\u4f46\u7edd\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u793a\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u9875\u89c6\u89c9\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65f6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528200\u4e2a\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u9875\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u683c\u5f0f\u5854\u539f\u7406\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u4eba\u7c7b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff08F1\u5206\u6570\u4ece0.031\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.297\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347858%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7edd\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\uff08Cohen's \u03ba = 0.071\uff09\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5143\u7d20\uff08\u5fbd\u7ae0\u6742\u4e71\u5ea6\u536038.6%\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u66f4\u5f3a\u8c03\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u793a\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ea7\u54c1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u989c\u8272\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

KANs' key innovation lies in the use of learnable non-linear activation functions, which are parametrized as splines. Splines are expressed as a linear combination of basis functions (B-splines). B-splines prove particularly challenging to accelerate due to their recursive definition. Systolic Array (SA)based architectures have shown great promise as DNN accelerators thanks to their energy efficiency and low latency. However, their suitability and efficiency in accelerating KANs have never been assessed. Thus, in this work, we explore the use of SA architecture to accelerate the KAN inference. We show that, while SAs can be used to accelerate part of the KAN inference, their utilization can be reduced to 30%. Hence, we propose KAN-SAs, a novel SA-based accelerator that leverages intrinsic properties of B-splines to enable efficient KAN inference. By including a nonrecursive B-spline implementation and leveraging the intrinsic KAN sparsity, KAN-SAs enhances conventional SAs, enabling efficient KAN inference, in addition to conventional DNNs. KAN-SAs achieves up to 100% SA utilization and up to 50% clock cycles reduction compared to conventional SAs of equivalent area, as shown by hardware synthesis results on a 28nm FD-SOI technology. We also evaluate different configurations of the accelerator on various KAN applications, confirming the improved efficiency of KAN inference provided by KAN-SAs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faKAN-SAs\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u9012\u5f52B\u6837\u6761\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u5229\u7528KAN\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5c06Systolic Array\u5229\u7528\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f3100%\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1150%\u65f6\u949f\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u52a0\u901fKolmogorov-Arnold Networks\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "KANs\u56e0\u5176\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u5176B\u6837\u6761\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u96be\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u4f20\u7edfSystolic Array\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u52a0\u901fDNN\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9KANs\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKAN-SAs\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u975e\u9012\u5f52B\u6837\u6761\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5229\u7528KAN\u56fa\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4f20\u7edfSystolic Array\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884cKAN\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4f20\u7edfDNN\u3002", "result": "\u572828nm FD-SOI\u6280\u672f\u4e0a\uff0cKAN-SAs\u76f8\u6bd4\u7b49\u6548\u9762\u79ef\u7684\u4f20\u7edfSA\u5b9e\u73b0100%\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1150%\u65f6\u949f\u5468\u671f\u3002\u5728\u4e0d\u540cKAN\u5e94\u7528\u914d\u7f6e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "KAN-SAs\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86KAN\u52a0\u901f\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aKAN\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edfDNN\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002"}}

Our work targets last-level cache (LLC) based architectures, including GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs) and AI accelerators. We introduce LLaMCAT, a novel approach to optimize the LLC for LLM inference. LLaMCAT combines Miss Status Holding Register (MSHR)- and load balance-aware cache arbitration with thread throttling to address stringent bandwidth demands and minimize cache stalls in KV Cache access. We also propose a hybrid simulation framework integrating analytical models with cycle-level simulators via memory traces, balancing architecture detail and efficiency.\n  Experiments demonstrate that LLaMCAT achieves an average speedup of 1.26x when the system is mainly bottlenecked by miss handling throughput, while baselines mostly show negative improvements since they are not optimized for this scenario. When the cache size is also limited, our policy achieves a speedup of 1.58x over the unoptimized version, and a 1.26x improvement over the best baseline (dyncta).

Appendix), 2 figures, 7 tables", "summary": "Multi-turn tool-calling LLMs (models capable of invoking external APIs or tools across several user turns) have emerged as a key feature in modern AI assistants, enabling extended dialogues from benign tasks to critical business, medical, and financial operations. Yet implementing multi-turn pipelines remains difficult for many safety-critical industries due to ongoing concerns regarding model resilience. While standardized benchmarks such as the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) have underpinned confidence concerning advanced function-calling models (like Salesforce's xLAM V2), there is still a lack of visibility into multi-turn conversation-level robustness, especially given their exposure to real-world systems. In this paper, we introduce Assertion-Conditioned Compliance (A-CC), a novel evaluation paradigm for multi-turn function-calling dialogues. A-CC provides holistic metrics that evaluate a model's behavior when confronted with misleading assertions originating from two distinct vectors: (1) user-sourced assertions (USAs), which measure sycophancy toward plausible but misinformed user beliefs, and (2) function-sourced assertions (FSAs), which measure compliance with plausible but contradictory system policies (e.g., stale hints from unmaintained tools). Our results show that models are highly vulnerable to both USA sycophancy and FSA policy conflicts, confirming A-CC as a critical, latent vulnerability in deployed agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAssertion-Conditioned Compliance (A-CC)\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528LLM\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u65ad\u8a00\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7528\u6237\u8bef\u5bfc\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u653f\u7b56\u51b2\u7a81\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528LLM\u5728\u5173\u952e\u884c\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5982BFCL\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u8f6e\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5c42\u9762\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u65ad\u8a00\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faA-CC\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u65ad\u8a00\u5411\u91cf\uff1a\u7528\u6237\u6765\u6e90\u65ad\u8a00(USAs)\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u9644\u548c\u503e\u5411\uff1b\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u6e90\u65ad\u8a00(FSAs)\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u77db\u76fe\u7cfb\u7edf\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u9075\u4ece\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u5411\u91cf\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9USAs\u548cFSAs\u65f6\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u9644\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6216\u9075\u4ece\u77db\u76fe\u7cfb\u7edf\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9eA-CC\u662f\u5df2\u90e8\u7f72\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "conclusion": "A-CC\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528LLM\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u6b64\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, segmentation performance is limited by the need for dense pixel-wise labels, which are expensive, time-consuming, and require expert knowledge. We propose FastTextDiff, a label-efficient diffusion-based segmentation model that integrates medical text annotations to enhance semantic representations. Our approach uses ModernBERT, a transformer capable of processing long clinical notes, to tightly link textual annotations with semantic content in medical images. Trained on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, ModernBERT encodes clinical knowledge that guides cross-modal attention between visual and textual features. This study validates ModernBERT as a fast, scalable alternative to Clinical BioBERT in diffusion-based segmentation pipelines and highlights the promise of multi-modal techniques for medical image analysis. By replacing Clinical BioBERT with ModernBERT, FastTextDiff benefits from FlashAttention 2, an alternating attention mechanism, and a 2-trillion-token corpus, improving both segmentation accuracy and training efficiency over traditional diffusion-based models.", "AI": {"tldr": "FastTextDiff\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u6548\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u6807\u6ce8\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ModernBERT\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\uff0c\u5728MIMIC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff08DPMs\uff09\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u6807\u6ce8\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFastTextDiff\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u6807\u6ce8\u5230\u6269\u6563\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002\u4f7f\u7528ModernBERT\uff08\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u7684transformer\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u4e34\u5e8a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4Clinical BioBERT\uff0cModernBERT\u91c7\u7528FlashAttention 2\u3001\u4ea4\u66ff\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c2\u4e07\u4ebftoken\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728MIMIC-III\u548cMIMIC-IV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cModernBERT\u4f5c\u4e3aClinical BioBERT\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u5206\u5272\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002FastTextDiff\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "ModernBERT\u662f\u6269\u6563\u5206\u5272\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2dClinical BioBERT\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6280\u672f\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u9614\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5272\u3002"}}

Handling these parameters efficiently in traditional accelerators is limited by data-transmission bottlenecks, motivating Compute-in-Memory (CiM) architectures that integrate computation within or near memory to reduce data movement. Recent work has explored CiM designs using Floating-Point (FP) and Integer (INT) operations. FP computations typically deliver higher output quality due to their wider dynamic range and precision, benefiting precision-sensitive Generative AI applications. These include models such as LLMs, thus driving advancements in FP-CiM accelerators. However, the vulnerability of FP-CiM to hardware faults remains underexplored, posing a major reliability concern in mission-critical settings. To address this gap, we systematically analyze hardware fault effects in FP-CiM by introducing bit-flip faults at key computational stages, including digital multipliers, CiM memory cells, and digital adder trees. Experiments with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as AlexNet and state-of-the-art LLMs including LLaMA-3.2-1B and Qwen-0.3B-Base reveal how faults at each stage affect inference accuracy. Notably, a single adder fault can reduce LLM accuracy to 0%. Based on these insights, we propose a fault-resilient design, SafeCiM, that mitigates fault impact far better than a naive FP-CiM with a pre-alignment stage. For example, with 4096 MAC units, SafeCiM reduces accuracy degradation by up to 49x for a single adder fault compared to the baseline FP-CiM architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6d6e\u70b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u5185\u5b58\uff08FP-CiM\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSafeCiM\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6545\u969c\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63a8\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\u6210\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u3002\u6d6e\u70b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u5185\u5b58\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u786c\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5173\u952e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u5b57\u4e58\u6cd5\u5668\u3001CiM\u5b58\u50a8\u5355\u5143\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u52a0\u6cd5\u5668\u6811\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u6bd4\u7279\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u786c\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4f7f\u7528AlexNet\u7b49CNN\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53caLLaMA-3.2-1B\u3001Qwen-0.3B-Base\u7b49\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u6545\u969c\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u4e2a\u52a0\u6cd5\u5668\u6545\u969c\u53ef\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u964d\u81f30%\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SafeCiM\u5bb9\u9519\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebfFP-CiM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u57284096\u4e2aMAC\u5355\u5143\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5355\u4e2a\u52a0\u6cd5\u5668\u6545\u969c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u51cf\u5c1149\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "FP-CiM\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u786c\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u52a0\u6cd5\u5668\u9636\u6bb5\u3002SafeCiM\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6545\u969c\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6d6e\u70b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u5185\u5b58\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing instantiations, however, typically rely on classical signature schemes whose long-term security is threatened by quantum-capable adversaries. In this paper we formalize security notions for evidence structures in the presence of quantum adversaries and study post-quantum (PQ) instantiations and migration strategies for deployed audit logs. We recall an abstraction of constant-size evidence structures and introduce game-based definitions of Q-Audit Integrity, Q-Non-Equivocation, and Q-Binding, capturing the inability of a quantum adversary to forge, equivocate, or rebind evidence items. We then analyze a hash-and-sign instantiation in the quantum random-oracle model (QROM), assuming an existentially unforgeable PQ signature scheme against quantum adversaries, and show that the resulting evidence structure satisfies these notions under standard assumptions. Building on this, we present three migration patterns for existing evidence logs: hybrid signatures, re-signing of legacy evidence, and Merkle-root anchoring, and analyze their security, storage, and computational trade-offs. A case study based on an industrial constant-size evidence platform for regulated AI at Codebat Technologies Inc. suggests that quantum-safe audit trails are achievable with moderate overhead and that systematic migration can significantly extend the evidentiary lifetime of existing deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u5b89\u5168\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u540e\u91cf\u5b50\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7528\u4e8eAI\u76d1\u7ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u6052\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u52a0\u5bc6\u8bc1\u636e\u8bb0\u5f55\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u5178\u7b7e\u540d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u957f\u671f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc1\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u540e\u91cf\u5b50\u8fc1\u79fb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "1) \u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u5bf9\u624b\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\uff08Q-Audit Integrity\u3001Q-Non-Equivocation\u3001Q-Binding\uff09\uff1b2) \u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u968f\u673a\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u54c8\u5e0c-\u7b7e\u540d\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u8fc1\u79fb\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u6df7\u5408\u7b7e\u540d\u3001\u91cd\u65b0\u7b7e\u540d\u3001Merkle\u6839\u951a\u5b9a\uff1b4) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540e\u91cf\u5b50\u7b7e\u540d\u65b9\u6848\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u6ee1\u8db3\u91cf\u5b50\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u8fc1\u79fb\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u91cf\u5b50\u5b89\u5168\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9002\u5ea6\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc1\u79fb\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u5ef6\u957f\u73b0\u6709\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u5b89\u5168\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8f68\u8ff9\u662f\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u540e\u91cf\u5b50\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc1\u79fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u9002\u5ea6\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u4fdd\u62a4\u73b0\u6709AI\u76d1\u7ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u8bb0\u5f55\u514d\u53d7\u91cf\u5b50\u653b\u51fb\u5a01\u80c1\u3002"}}

However, the limited number of parameters of Deep Neural Networks for the MDE task, designed for IoT nodes, results in severe accuracy drops when the sensor data observed in the field shifts significantly from the training dataset. To address this domain shift problem, we present a multi-modal On-Device Learning (ODL) technique, deployed on an IoT device integrating a Greenwaves GAP9 MicroController Unit (MCU), a 80 mW monocular camera and a 8 x 8 pixel depth sensor, consuming $\\approx$300mW. In its normal operation, this setup feeds a tiny 107 k-parameter $\u03bc$PyD-Net model with monocular images for inference. The depth sensor, usually deactivated to minimize energy consumption, is only activated alongside the camera to collect pseudo-labels when the system is placed in a new environment. Then, the fine-tuning task is performed entirely on the MCU, using the new data. To optimize our backpropagation-based on-device training, we introduce a novel memory-driven sparse update scheme, which minimizes the fine-tuning memory to 1.2 MB, 2.2x less than a full update, while preserving accuracy (i.e., only 2% and 1.5% drops on the KITTI and NYUv2 datasets). Our in-field tests demonstrate, for the first time, that ODL for MDE can be performed in 17.8 minutes on the IoT node, reducing the root mean squared error from 4.9 to 0.6m with only 3 k self-labeled samples, collected in a real-life deployment scenario.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u5728MCU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5f53\u73b0\u573a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1) \u5728GAP9 MCU\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u03bcPyD-Net\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5355\u76ee\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\uff1b2) \u4ec5\u5728\u8fdb\u5165\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6536\u96c6\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u5185\u5b58\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u5fae\u8c03\u5185\u5b58\u964d\u81f31.2MB\uff1b4) \u5b8c\u5168\u5728MCU\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "1) \u5fae\u8c03\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c112.2\u500d\uff081.2MB vs \u5b8c\u6574\u66f4\u65b0\uff09\uff1b2) \u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u5c0f\uff08KITTI\u548cNYUv2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d2%\u548c1.5%\uff09\uff1b3) \u73b0\u573a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4ec5\u75283k\u81ea\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u572817.8\u5206\u949f\u5185\u5c06RMSE\u4ece4.9m\u964d\u81f30.6m\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) model automatically detects sub-cells that can be generated by available generator scripts in the library, and suggests using them in the hierarchically correct places of the generator software. In experiments, the CNN model examined sub-cells of a high-speed wireline receiver that has a total of 4,885 sub-cell instances including different 145 sub-cell designs. The CNN model classified the sub-cell instances into 51 generatable and one not-generatable classes.

This work explores AI-driven analysis of classroom recordings, focusing on multimodal instructional activity and discourse recognition as a foundation for actionable feedback. Using a densely annotated dataset of 164 hours of video and 68 lesson transcripts, we design parallel, modality-specific pipelines. For video, we evaluate zero-shot multimodal LLMs, fine-tuned vision-language models, and self-supervised video transformers on 24 activity labels. For transcripts, we fine-tune a transformer-based classifier with contextualized inputs and compare it against prompting-based LLMs on 19 discourse labels.

The results show that fine-tuned models consistently outperform prompting-based approaches, achieving macro-F1 scores of 0.577 for video and 0.460 for transcripts.

A major challenge in DQC lies in reducing the communication cost introduced by remote CNOT gates, which are significantly slower and more resource-consuming than local operations. Existing DQC approaches treat the three essential components (qubit allocation, entanglement management, and network scheduling) as independent stages, optimizing each in isolation. However, we observe that these components are inherently interdependent, and therefore adopting a unified optimization strategy can be more efficient to achieve the global optimal solutions. Consequently, we propose UNIQ, a novel DQC optimization framework that integrates all three components into a non-linear integer programming (NIP) model. UNIQ aims to reduce the circuit runtime by maximizing parallel Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation through the use of idle communication qubits, while simultaneously minimizing the communication cost of remote gates. To solve this NP-hard formulated problem, we adopt two key strategies: a greedy algorithm for efficiently mapping logical qubits to different QPUs, and a JIT (Just-In-Time) approach that builds EPR pairs in parallel within each time slot. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach is widely applicable to diverse quantum circuits and QPU topologies, while substantially reducing communication cost and runtime over existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "UNIQ\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u3001\u7ea0\u7f20\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u8c03\u5ea6\uff09\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u9762\u4e34\u8fdc\u7a0bCNOT\u95e8\u7684\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUNIQ\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u6620\u5c04\u903b\u8f91\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5230\u4e0d\u540cQPU\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528JIT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u69fd\u5e76\u884c\u6784\u5efaEPR\u5bf9\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f2\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUNIQ\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u548cQPU\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0cUNIQ\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although psychological theories link personality traits to such biases, it is unclear whether simulated personalities in LLMs exhibit similar effects. We investigate how Big Five personality profiles in LLMs influence priming in relevance labeling, using multiple LLMs on TREC 2021 and 2022 Deep Learning Track datasets. Our results show that certain profiles, such as High Openness and Low Neuroticism, consistently reduce priming susceptibility. Additionally, the most effective personality in mitigating priming may vary across models and task types. Based on these findings, we propose personality prompting as a method to mitigate threshold priming, connecting psychological evidence with LLM-based evaluation practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u5177\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u542f\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u8d4b\u4e88\u7279\u5b9a\u5927\u4e94\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u3001\u4f4e\u795e\u7ecf\u8d28\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4eba\u683c\u63d0\u793a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u542f\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u542f\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff08\u5148\u524d\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u5f71\u54cd\u540e\u7eed\u5224\u65ad\uff09\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u5c06\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u4e0e\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695aLLM\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u662f\u5426\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u67e5LLM\u4e2d\u5927\u4e94\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u4e2d\u7684\u542f\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u5728TREC 2021\u548c2022\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8d5b\u9053\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u542f\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u67d0\u4e9b\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u3001\u4f4e\u795e\u7ecf\u8d28\uff09\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u964d\u4f4e\u542f\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u542f\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4eba\u683c\u63d0\u793a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u9608\u503c\u542f\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002"}}

In a SemImage, each word is represented as a pixel in a 2D image: rows correspond to sentences and an additional boundary row is inserted between sentences to mark semantic transitions. Each pixel is not a typical RGB value but a vector in a disentangled HSV color space, encoding different linguistic features: the Hue with two components H_cos and H_sin to account for circularity encodes the topic, Saturation encodes the sentiment, and Value encodes intensity or certainty. We enforce this disentanglement via a multi-task learning framework: a ColorMapper network maps each word embedding to the HSV space, and auxiliary supervision is applied to the Hue and Saturation channels to predict topic and sentiment labels, alongside the main task objective. The insertion of dynamically computed boundary rows between sentences yields sharp visual boundaries in the image when consecutive sentences are semantically dissimilar, effectively making paragraph breaks salient. We integrate SemImage with standard 2D CNNs (e.g., ResNet) for document classification. Experiments on multi-label datasets (with both topic and sentiment annotations) and single-label benchmarks demonstrate that SemImage can achieve competitive or better accuracy than strong text classification baselines (including BERT and hierarchical attention networks) while offering enhanced interpretability. An ablation study confirms the importance of the multi-channel HSV representation and the dynamic boundary rows. Finally, we present visualizations of SemImage that qualitatively reveal clear patterns corresponding to topic shifts and sentiment changes in the generated image, suggesting that our representation makes these linguistic features visible to both humans and machines.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemImage\uff1a\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u6587\u6863\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528HSV\u989c\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u4e3b\u9898\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CNN\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u6863\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8aBERT\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982BERT\uff09\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u53c8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5229\u7528CNN\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u53ef\u89c1\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u6587\u6863\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u50cf\uff1a\u6bcf\u884c\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e00\u4e2a\u53e5\u5b50\uff0c\u5355\u8bcd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u50cf\u7d20\uff1b2. \u5728\u53e5\u5b50\u95f4\u63d2\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u884c\u4ee5\u6807\u8bb0\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528HSV\u989c\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\uff1aHue\uff08H_cos\u548cH_sin\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u4e3b\u9898\uff0cSaturation\u7f16\u7801\u60c5\u611f\uff0cValue\u7f16\u7801\u5f3a\u5ea6/\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b4. \u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5f3a\u5236\u89e3\u8026\uff1aColorMapper\u7f51\u7edc\u5c06\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u6620\u5c04\u5230HSV\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5bf9Hue\u548cSaturation\u901a\u9053\u5e94\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3b\u9898\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b5. \u5c06SemImage\u4e0e\u6807\u51c62D CNN\uff08\u5982ResNet\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u8fdb\u884c\u6587\u6863\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u540c\u65f6\u5305\u542b\u4e3b\u9898\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\uff09\u548c\u5355\u6807\u7b7e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSemImage\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ecBERT\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u591a\u901a\u9053HSV\u8868\u793a\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8fb9\u754c\u884c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u663e\u793aSemImage\u80fd\u591f\u6e05\u6670\u5c55\u793a\u4e3b\u9898\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "SemImage\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6587\u6863\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u53ef\u89c1\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u90fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, the advancements achieved through semantic communication are closely dependent on the development of deep learning (DL) models for joint source-channel coding (JSCC) encoder/decoder techniques, which require a large amount of data for training. To address this data-intensive nature of DL models, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to train a model in a distributed manner, where the server broadcasts the DL model to clients in the network for training with their local data. However, the conventional FL approaches suffer from catastrophic degradation when client data are from different domains. In contrast, in this paper, a novel FL framework is proposed to address this domain shift by constructing the global representation, which aligns with the local features of the clients to preserve the semantics of different data domains. In addition, the dominance problem of client domains with a large number of samples is identified and, then, addressed with a domain-aware aggregation approach. This work is the first to consider the domain shift in training the semantic communication system for the image reconstruction task. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the model-contrastive FL (MOON) framework by 0.5 for PSNR values under three domains at an SNR of 1 dB, and this gap continues to widen as the channel quality improves.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u56e0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u672c\u5730\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u4f9d\u8d56\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u4fe1\u6e90\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u80fd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u65f6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u707e\u96be\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b2) \u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u591a\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9886\u57df\u4e3b\u5bfc\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3) \u9996\u6b21\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u3001\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd41dB\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60(MOON)\u6846\u67b6\u7684PSNR\u503c\u9ad8\u51fa0.5\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u4fe1\u9053\u8d28\u91cf\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and DeepSeek R1, the system employs a detailed taxonomy grounded in linguistic theories from Corder (1967), Richards (1971), and James (1998). Errors are classified at both word and sentence levels, covering spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Implemented through Python-coded API calls, the system provides granular feedback beyond traditional rubric-based assessments. Initial testing on isolated errors refined the taxonomy, addressing challenges like overlapping categories. Final testing used \"English as she is spoke\" by Jose da Fonseca (1855), a text rich with authentic linguistic errors, to evaluate the system's capacity for handling complex, multi-layered analysis. The AI successfully identified diverse error types but showed limitations in contextual understanding and occasionally generated new error categories when encountering uncoded errors. This research demonstrates AI's potential to transform EFL instruction by automating detailed error analysis and feedback. While promising, further development is needed to improve contextual accuracy and expand the taxonomy to stylistic and discourse-level errors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684AI\u8f85\u52a9\u82f1\u8bed\u5199\u4f5c\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u62fc\u5199\u3001\u8bed\u6cd5\u3001\u6807\u70b9\u7b49\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u5c40\u9650\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u6269\u5c55\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u89c4\u7684\u82f1\u8bed\u5199\u4f5c\u8bc4\u4f30\u53cd\u9988\u4e0d\u591f\u7ec6\u81f4\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3aEFL\u6559\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u548c\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6559\u5b66\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Claude 3.5 Sonnet\u548cDeepSeek R1\u7b49\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eCorder\u3001Richards\u548cJames\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u5efa\u8be6\u7ec6\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Python API\u8c03\u7528\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u8bed\u8a00\u9519\u8bef\u7684\"English as she is spoke\"\u6587\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u79cd\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9047\u5230\u672a\u7f16\u7801\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\u4f1a\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u5728EFL\u6559\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8be6\u7ec6\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6587\u4f53\u548c\u8bed\u7bc7\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002"}}

While short-term predictions typically rely on local weather conditions, long-term forecasting requires accounting for the Earth's interconnectedness, including global patterns and teleconnections. We introduce TeleViT, a Teleconnection-aware Vision Transformer that integrates (i) fine-scale local fire drivers, (ii) coarsened global fields, and (iii) teleconnection indices. This multi-scale fusion is achieved through an asymmetric tokenization strategy that produces heterogeneous tokens processed jointly by a transformer encoder, followed by a decoder that preserves spatial structure by mapping local tokens to their corresponding prediction patches.\n  Using the global SeasFire dataset (2001-2021, 8-day resolution), TeleViT improves AUPRC performance over U-Net++, ViT, and climatology across all lead times, including horizons up to four months. At zero lead, TeleViT with indices and global inputs reaches AUPRC 0.630 (ViT 0.617, U-Net 0.620), at 16x8day lead (around 4 months), TeleViT variants using global input maintain 0.601-0.603 (ViT 0.582, U-Net 0.578), while surpassing the climatology (0.572) at all lead times. Regional results show the highest skill in seasonally consistent fire regimes, such as African savannas, and lower skill in boreal and arid regions. Attention and attribution analyses indicate that predictions rely mainly on local tokens, with global fields and indices contributing coarse contextual information. These findings suggest that architectures explicitly encoding large-scale Earth-system context can extend wildfire predictability on subseasonal-to-seasonal timescales.", "AI": {"tldr": "TeleViT\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u706b\u707e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3001\u5168\u7403\u573a\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9065\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Vision Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u8fbe4\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u91ce\u706b\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u91ce\u706b\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u71c3\u6599\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u6570\u5468\u81f3\u6570\u6708\uff09\u975e\u5e38\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u800c\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u5730\u7403\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u8054\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5168\u7403\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u9065\u76f8\u5173\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTeleViT\uff08Teleconnection-aware Vision Transformer\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6574\u5408\uff1a(1)\u7ec6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c40\u90e8\u706b\u707e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c(2)\u7c97\u5316\u5168\u7403\u573a\u6570\u636e\uff0c(3)\u9065\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6570\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4fdd\u6301\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u6807\u8bb0\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728SeasFire\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff082001-2021\uff0c8\u5929\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cTeleViT\u5728\u6240\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff08\u5305\u62ec4\u4e2a\u6708\uff09\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eU-Net++\u3001ViT\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u5728\u96f6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65f6AUPRC\u8fbe0.630\uff0c4\u4e2a\u6708\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u63010.601-0.603\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8fc7\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728\u975e\u6d32\u70ed\u5e26\u8349\u539f\u7b49\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u706b\u60c5\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5728\u5317\u65b9\u548c\u5e72\u65f1\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5730\u7403\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u91ce\u706b\u5728\u6b21\u5b63\u8282\u5230\u5b63\u8282\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5168\u7403\u573a\u548c\u6307\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

As with any engineering challenge, identifying the most effective solutions requires thorough exploration of diverse architectural proposals, device technologies, and application domains. In this context, simulation plays a critical role in enabling researchers to evaluate, compare, and refine PIM designs prior to fabrication. Over the past decade, a variety of PIM simulators have been introduced, spanning low-level device models, architectural frameworks, and application-oriented environments. These tools differ significantly in fidelity, scalability, supported memory/compute technologies, and benchmark compatibility. Understanding these trade-offs is essential for researchers to select appropriate simulators that accurately map and validate their research efforts. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of PIM simulation methodologies and tools.

However, they introduce operational complexities in service integration and system management that makes swift and accurate anomaly detection and localisation challenging. Despite the complex, dynamic, and interconnected nature of microservice architectures, prior works that investigate metrics for anomaly detection rarely include explicit information about time-varying interdependencies. And whilst prior works on fault localisation typically do incorporate information about dependencies between microservices, they scale poorly to real world large-scale deployments due to their reliance on computationally expensive causal inference. To address these challenges we propose FC-ADL, an end-to-end scalable approach for detecting and localising anomalous changes from microservice metrics based on the neuroscientific concept of functional connectivity. We show that by efficiently characterising time-varying changes in dependencies between microservice metrics we can both detect anomalies and provide root cause candidates without incurring the significant overheads of causal and multivariate approaches. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve top detection and localisation performance across a wide degree of different fault scenarios when compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Unlike general-purpose agent benchmarks for search and prediction, professional crypto analysis presents specific challenges: \\emph{extreme time-sensitivity}, \\emph{a highly adversarial information environment}, and the critical need to synthesize data from \\emph{diverse, specialized sources}, such as on-chain intelligence platforms and real-time Decentralized Finance (DeFi) dashboards. CryptoBench thus serves as a much more challenging and valuable scenario for LLM agent assessment. To address these challenges, we constructed a live, dynamic benchmark featuring 50 questions per month, expertly designed by crypto-native professionals to mirror actual analyst workflows. These tasks are rigorously categorized within a four-quadrant system: Simple Retrieval, Complex Retrieval, Simple Prediction, and Complex Prediction. This granular categorization enables a precise assessment of an LLM agent's foundational data-gathering capabilities alongside its advanced analytical and forecasting skills.\n  Our evaluation of ten LLMs, both directly and within an agentic framework, reveals a performance hierarchy and uncovers a failure mode. We observe a \\textit{retrieval-prediction imbalance}, where many leading models, despite being proficient at data retrieval, demonstrate a pronounced weakness in tasks requiring predictive analysis.

In the literature, two primary deposition techniques for large-scale 3D concrete printing (3DCP) have been described, namely extrusion-based (Contour Crafting-CC) and shotcrete 3D printing (SC3DP) methods. The deposition methods use a digitally controlled nozzle to print material layer by layer. The continuous flow of concrete material used to create the printed structure is called a filament or layer. As these filaments are the essential structure defining the printed object, the filaments' geometry quality control is crucial. This paper presents an automated procedure for quality control (QC) of filaments in extrusion-based and SC3DP printing methods.

Because it occupies over half of the chip area, cache memory is highly susceptible to transient and permanent faults, posing reliability challenges. As the only hardware-managed memory module, the cache tag array is the most active and critical component, dominating both energy usage and error rate. Tag partitioning is a widely used technique to reduce tag-access energy and enhance reliability. It divides tag comparison into two phases: first comparing the k lower bits, and then activating only the matching tag entries to compare the remaining higher bits. The key design parameter is the selection of the tag-splitting point k, which determines how many reads are eliminated. However, prior studies have chosen k intuitively, randomly, or empirically, without justification. Even experimentally determined values are ad-hoc and do not generalize across cache configurations due to high sensitivity to architectural parameters.\n  In this paper, we analytically show that choosing k too large or too small substantially reduces the effectiveness of tag partitioning. We then derive a formulation that determines the optimal splitting point based on cache configuration parameters. The formulation is convex, differentiable, and capable of precisely quantifying tag-partitioning efficiency for any k and configuration. To validate our model, we experimentally evaluate tag-partitioning efficiency and optimal k across a broad set of cache designs and demonstrate close agreement between analytical and experimental results. The proposed formulation enables designers and researchers to instantly compute the optimal tag-splitting point and accurately estimate tag-read reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u7f13\u5b58\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u533a\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u5272\u70b9k\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5173\u8054\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u5bf9\u5904\u7406\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u77ac\u6001\u548c\u6c38\u4e45\u6545\u969c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u533a\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u7b7e\u8bbf\u95ee\u80fd\u8017\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u5206\u5272\u70b9k\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u51ed\u76f4\u89c9\u3001\u968f\u673a\u6216\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u8de8\u914d\u7f6e\u901a\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f13\u5b58\u914d\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u5272\u70b9k\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u5f0f\u662f\u51f8\u4e14\u53ef\u5fae\u7684\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u91cf\u5316\u4efb\u4f55k\u503c\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u533a\u6548\u7387\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7f13\u5b58\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u9009\u62e9\u8fc7\u5927\u6216\u8fc7\u5c0f\u7684k\u503c\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u533a\u6548\u679c\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u4f18k\u503c\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u8bfb\u53d6\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u5373\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5272\u70b9\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6807\u7b7e\u8bfb\u53d6\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f13\u5b58\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u533a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. The results show that Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs and 19X on GPUs over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware.

However, current methods employ uniform resource distribution across all reasoning sub-problems, creating fundamental bottlenecks where challenging sub-problems receive insufficient attention while routine operations consume disproportionate resources. This uniform allocation creates performance bottlenecks where additional computational resources yield diminishing returns. Inspired by dual-process theory, we propose \\textbf{SCALE} (Selective Resource Allocation), a framework that selectively allocates computational resources based on sub-problem difficulty. SCALE operates through four stages: (1) problem decomposition into sequential reasoning sub-problems, (2) difficulty assessment of each sub-problem to distinguish between routine operations and computationally challenging sub-problems, (3) selective processing mode assignment between System 1 for simple sub-problems and System 2 for complex ones, and (4) sequential execution with context propagation. By concentrating resources on challenging sub-problems while processing routine operations efficiently, SCALE achieves substantial performance improvements with superior resource utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCALE significantly outperforms uniform scaling baselines, achieving accuracy improvements of up to 13.75 percentage points (57.50% to 71.25% on AIME25) while reducing computational costs by 33%-53%, representing a major advance in test-time scaling that addresses fundamental limitations of current approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCALE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5206\u914d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6269\u5c55\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u5e38\u89c4\u64cd\u4f5c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCALE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1) \u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2) \u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\uff1b3) \u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u914dSystem 1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u914dSystem 2\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b4) \u987a\u5e8f\u6267\u884c\u5e76\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5728AIME25\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534713.75\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff08\u4ece57.50%\u523071.25%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e33%-53%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SCALE\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u96c6\u4e2d\u8d44\u6e90\u800c\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5e38\u89c4\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Wrist-worn activity signals from the Psykose and Depresjon datasets were converted into 30 by 48 images and evaluated through a three-fold subject-wise split. Although all methods fitted the training data well, their behaviour on unseen data differed. VGG16 improved steadily but often settled at lower accuracy. ViT-B/16 reached strong results in some runs, but its performance shifted noticeably from fold to fold. CoAtNet-Tiny stood out as the most reliable, recording the highest average accuracy and the most stable curves across folds. It also produced the strongest precision, recall, and F1-scores, particularly for the underrepresented depression and schizophrenia classes. Overall, the findings indicate that CoAtNet-Tiny performed most consistently on the actigraphy images, while VGG16 and ViT-B/16 yielded mixed results. These observations suggest that certain hybrid designs may be especially suited for mental-health work that relies on actigraphy-derived images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f83VGG16\u3001ViT-B/16\u548cCoAtNet-Tiny\u4e09\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bb0\u5f55\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc6\u522b\u6291\u90c1\u3001\u7cbe\u795e\u5206\u88c2\u75c7\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u7167\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CoAtNet-Tiny\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e5\u5e38\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bb0\u5f55\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\uff08\u6291\u90c1\u3001\u7cbe\u795e\u5206\u88c2\u75c7\u3001\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u7167\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Psykose\u548cDepresjon\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u624b\u8155\u6d3b\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a30\u00d748\u50cf\u7d20\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u6298\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u5206\u5c42\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83VGG16\u3001ViT-B/16\u548cCoAtNet-Tiny\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "CoAtNet-Tiny\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8de8\u6298\u6027\u80fd\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6291\u90c1\u548c\u7cbe\u795e\u5206\u88c2\u75c7\u7b49\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\uff1bVGG16\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1bViT-B/16\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\u4f46\u8de8\u6298\u6ce2\u52a8\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "CoAtNet-Tiny\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bb0\u5f55\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4e00\u81f4\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u67d0\u4e9b\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u67b6\u6784\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bb0\u5f55\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}}

In this tutorial paper, we outline the main architectural design principles behind fully digital neuromorphic processors and illustrate them using the SENECA platform as a running example. Starting from a flexible array of tiny RISC-V processing cores connected by a simple Network-on-Chip (NoC), we show how to progressively evolve the architecture: from a baseline event-driven implementation of fully connected networks, to versions with dedicated Neural Processing Elements (NPEs) and a loop controller that offloads fine-grained control from the general-purpose cores. Along the way, we discuss software and mapping techniques such as spike grouping, event-driven depth-first convolution for convolutional networks, and hard-attention style processing for high-resolution event-based vision. The focus is on architectural trade-offs, performance and energy bottlenecks, and on leveraging flexibility to incrementally add domain-specific acceleration. This paper assumes familiarity with basic neuromorphic concepts (spikes, event-driven computation, sparse activation) and deep neural network workloads.

Yang", "Nikolaos Pappas"], "title": "Feature-Based Semantics-Aware Scheduling for Energy-Harvesting Federated Learning", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.DC", "cs.IT", "cs.NI", "eess.SP"], "comment": "This paper is currently under review for presentation at a peer-reviewed conference", "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) on resource-constrained edge devices faces a critical challenge: The computational energy required for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often dominates communication costs. However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies.

Tasks that once relied on a single modality, such as text, images, or audio, are now enriched by seamless interactions between multimodal data. These connections bridge information gaps: an image can visually materialize a text, while audio can add context to an image. Researchers have developed numerous multimodal models, but most rely on resource-intensive training across multiple modalities. Similarly, extending these models to new languages often follows the same resource-heavy training strategy. In this work, we propose a multimodal and multilingual architecture, CACARA, trained through emergent alignment learning, enabling the seamless integration of new modalities into an existing bimodal/multimodal model without requiring full retraining. This work breaks new ground by demonstrating that this emergent alignment paradigm can unlock multilingual capabilities from monolingual training. By fine-tuning the newly incorporated modality only on data aligned with the English language, our model develops support for over 100 languages without explicit multilingual pretraining or tuning of the text encoder. Such emergent multimodal and multilingual properties are gained efficiently, preserving previously learned knowledge at a training cost comparable to that of a monolingual model. Our strategy achieves up to a 14.24 percentage points improvement in R@1 audio-to-text retrieval, outperforming state-of-the-art multimodal models -- all without the heavy computational cost of retraining across every modality and language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCACARA\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u65b0\u8208\u5c0d\u9f4a\u5b78\u7fd2\u5be6\u73fe\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u8207\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7121\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u91cd\u65b0\u8a13\u7df4\u5373\u53ef\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u6a21\u614b\uff0c\u4e14\u50c5\u7528\u82f1\u8a9e\u6578\u64da\u5c31\u80fd\u652f\u6301100+\u8a9e\u8a00\u3002", "motivation": "\u73fe\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u7684\u8cc7\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u64f4\u5c55\u5230\u65b0\u8a9e\u8a00\u4e5f\u9700\u540c\u6a23\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8a08\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u6a21\u614b\u4e26\u5be6\u73fe\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCACARA\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u63a1\u7528\u65b0\u8208\u5c0d\u9f4a\u5b78\u7fd2\u7bc4\u5f0f\uff0c\u50c5\u9700\u5728\u65b0\u6a21\u614b\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u82f1\u8a9e\u5c0d\u9f4a\u6578\u64da\u9032\u884c\u5fae\u8abf\uff0c\u7121\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u91cd\u65b0\u8a13\u7df4\u6216\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u5be6\u73fe\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u8207\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u97f3\u983b\u5230\u6587\u672c\u6aa2\u7d22\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2dR@1\u63d0\u534714.24\u500b\u767e\u5206\u9ede\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301100+\u8a9e\u8a00\uff0c\u8a13\u7df4\u6210\u672c\u50c5\u76f8\u7576\u65bc\u55ae\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u8208\u5c0d\u9f4a\u5b78\u7fd2\u7bc4\u5f0f\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5be6\u73fe\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u8207\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u50c5\u7528\u82f1\u8a9e\u6578\u64da\u5fae\u8abf\u65b0\u6a21\u614b\u5373\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8a08\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u70ba\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u6a21\u578b\u64f4\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

It processes data from a spatial Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), reconfigurable to a temporal DVS via pixel sharing, minimizing sensor area.

Yet, training robust machine learning models typically requires large volumes of high-quality labeled data, which are expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive to obtain in manufacturing. Moreover, defective samples are intrinsically rare, leading to severe class imbalance that degrades model performance. These data constraints hinder the widespread adoption of machine learning-based quality inspection methods in real production environments. Synthetic data generation (SDG) offers a promising solution by enabling the creation of large, balanced, and fully annotated datasets in an efficient, cost-effective, and scalable manner. This paper presents a hybrid SDG framework that integrates simulation-based rendering, domain randomization, and real background compositing to enable zero-shot learning for computer vision-based industrial part inspection without manual annotation. The SDG pipeline generates 12,960 labeled images in one hour by varying part geometry, lighting, and surface properties, and then compositing synthetic parts onto real image backgrounds. A two-stage architecture utilizing a YOLOv8n backbone for object detection and MobileNetV3-small for quality classification is trained exclusively on synthetic data and evaluated on 300 real industrial parts. The proposed approach achieves an mAP@0.5 of 0.995 for detection, 96% classification accuracy, and 90.1% balanced accuracy. Comparative evaluation against few-shot real-data baseline approaches demonstrates significant improvement. The proposed SDG-based approach achieves 90-91% balanced accuracy under severe class imbalance, while the baselines reach only 50% accuracy.

However, fixed-point numbers cover a relatively small dynamic range for a given bitwidth. In contrast, floating-point numbers offer a larger dynamic range at the cost of increased hardware complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel number format called variable-point (VP). VP numbers cover a larger dynamic range than fixed-point numbers with similar bitwidth, without notably increasing hardware complexity -- this allows for a more efficient representation of signals with high dynamic range. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed VP number format, we consider a matrix-vector multiplication engine for spatial equalization in multi-antenna wireless communication systems involving high-dynamic-range signals. Through post-layout VLSI implementation results, we demonstrate that the proposed VP-based design achieves 20% and 10% area and power savings, respectively, compared to a fully optimized fixed-point design, without incurring any noticeable performance degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u53d8\u91cf\u70b9(VP)\u6570\u5b57\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u786c\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5b9a\u70b9\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5728VLSI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9a\u70b9\u6570\u8868\u793a\u5728VLSI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5e38\u7528\u4f46\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6d6e\u70b9\u6570\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u5927\u4f46\u786c\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6298\u4e2d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u786c\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6269\u5c55\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d8\u91cf\u70b9(VP)\u6570\u5b57\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5b9a\u70b9\u6570\u548c\u6d6e\u70b9\u6570\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5747\u8861\u77e9\u9635\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u6cd5\u5f15\u64ce\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1VP\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u540e\u5e03\u5c40VLSI\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eVP\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f8\u6bd4\u5b8c\u5168\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5b9a\u70b9\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8620%\u7684\u9762\u79ef\u8282\u7701\u548c10%\u7684\u529f\u8017\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "VP\u6570\u5b57\u683c\u5f0f\u5728\u4e0d\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u786c\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684VLSI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We have also proposed several approaches specific to sentiment analysis in English only. We have accordingly made five major and three minor contributions. We generated a novel and effective feature set by combining unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised metrics. We then fed them as input into classical machine learning methods, and outperformed neural network models for datasets of different genres in both Turkish and English. We created a polarity lexicon with a semi-supervised domain-specific method, which has been the first approach applied for corpora in Turkish. We performed a fine morphological analysis for the sentiment classification task in Turkish by determining the polarities of morphemes. This can be adapted to other morphologically-rich or agglutinative languages as well. We have built a novel neural network architecture, which combines recurrent and recursive neural network models for English. We built novel word embeddings that exploit sentiment, syntactic, semantic, and lexical characteristics for both Turkish and English. We also redefined context windows as subclauses in modelling word representations in English. This can also be applied to other linguistic fields and natural language processing tasks. We have achieved state-of-the-art and significant results for all these original approaches. Our minor contributions include methods related to aspect-based sentiment in Turkish, parameter redefinition in the semi-supervised approach, and aspect term extraction techniques for English. This thesis can be considered the most detailed and comprehensive study made on sentiment analysis in Turkish as of July, 2020.

The current research mitigates the fundamental OOD issue through a comprehensive approach integrating ResNet50-based OOD filtering with YOLO architectures (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, YOLOv12) for accurate detection of breast cancer. Our strategy establishes an in-domain gallery via cosine similarity to rigidly reject non-mammographic inputs prior to processing, ensuring that only domain-associated images supply the detection pipeline. The OOD detection component achieves 99.77\\% general accuracy with immaculate 100\\% accuracy on OOD test sets, effectively eliminating irrelevant imaging modalities. ResNet50 was selected as the optimum backbone after 12 CNN architecture searches. The joint framework unites OOD robustness with high detection performance (mAP@0.5: 0.947) and enhanced interpretability through Grad-CAM visualizations. Experimental validation establishes that OOD filtering significantly improves system reliability by preventing false alarms on out-of-distribution inputs while maintaining higher detection accuracy on mammographic data.

To address this challenge, we focus on Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) as an effective alternative that provides a trade-off between energy efficiency and programmability. This paper presents the first comprehensive, end-to-end evaluation of a non-AI-specialized Coarse-Grained Linear Array (CGLA) accelerator for the state-of-the-art Qwen LLM family. The architecture has a general-purpose, task-agnostic design, yet its flexible instruction set allows for domain-specific adaptations. This flexibility enables the architecture to achieve high efficiency for sustainable LLM inference. We assess the performance of our architecture on an FPGA prototype using the widely adopted llama.cpp framework. We then project its potential as a 28nm ASIC and compare it against a high-performance GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090) and an edge AI device (NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin). While GPUs exhibit lower latency, our non-AI-specific accelerator achieves higher energy efficiency, improving the Power-Delay Product (PDP) by up to 44.4x and 13.6x compared with the RTX 4090 and Jetson, respectively. Similarly, it reduces the Energy-Delay Product (EDP) by up to 11.5x compared to the high-performance GPU, demonstrating a favorable performance-energy trade-off.

We introduce a diagnostic framework that distinguishes genuine mathematical reasoning from superficial pattern matching through four complementary axes: forward-backward consistency, transitivity coverage, counterfactual sensitivity, and perturbation robustness. Through a case study applying this framework to Qwen3-0.6B on the MenatQA dataset, we reveal a striking disconnect between surface performance and reasoning fidelity. While the model achieves reasonable answer accuracy (70%+), it demonstrates poor backward consistency (15%), limited transitivity coverage (32.2%), and brittle sensitivity to perturbations. Our diagnostics expose reasoning failures invisible to traditional accuracy metrics, suggesting that this small model relies heavily on pattern matching rather than genuine logical computation. While our empirical findings are based on a single 600M-parameter model, the diagnostic framework itself is model-agnostic and generalizable. We release our evaluation protocols to enable the research community to assess reasoning fidelity across different model scales and architectures, moving beyond surface-level accuracy toward verifiable mathematical reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u800c\u975e\u903b\u8f91\u8ba1\u7b97", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u903b\u8f91\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u56db\u8f74\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u524d\u540e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4f20\u9012\u6027\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u6270\u52a8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Qwen3-0.6B\u6a21\u578b\u548cMenatQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76", "result": "Qwen3-0.6B\u8868\u9762\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe70%+\uff0c\u4f46\u540e\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ec515%\uff0c\u4f20\u9012\u6027\u8986\u76d632.2%\uff0c\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406", "conclusion": "\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u4e14\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6"}}

However, existing methods primarily consider global semantics with image-level constraints, which excessively reduces attention to the discriminative local context of the class and leads to a performance improvement bottleneck. Moreover, existing methods for generating augmented samples usually involve cutting and pasting rectangular or square regions, resulting in a loss of object part information. To mitigate the problem of inconsistency between the augmented image and the generated mixed label, existing methods usually require double forward propagation or rely on an external pre-trained network for object centering, which is inefficient. To overcome the above limitations, we propose LGCOAMix, an efficient context-aware and object-part-aware superpixel-based grid blending method for data augmentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a label mixing strategy using a superpixel attention approach has been proposed for cutmix-based data augmentation. It is the first instance of learning local features from discriminative superpixel-wise regions and cross-image superpixel contrasts. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets show that LGCOAMix outperforms state-of-the-art cutmix-based data augmentation methods on classification tasks, {and weakly supervised object location on CUB200-2011.} We have demonstrated the effectiveness of LGCOAMix not only for CNN networks, but also for Transformer networks.

Laser speckle sensing has recently emerged as a low-cost and non-destructive modality for material classification; however, prior work has either relied on computationally expensive backbone networks or addressed only limited subsets of materials. In this study, A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) tailored for speckle patterns is proposed, designed to minimize parameters while maintaining high discriminative power. Using the complete SensiCut dataset of 59 material classes spanning woods, acrylics, composites, textiles, metals, and paper-based products, the proposed model achieves 95.05% test accuracy, with macro and weighted F1-scores of 0.951. The network contains only 341k trainable parameters (~1.3 MB) -- over 70X fewer than ResNet-50 -- and achieves an inference speed of 295 images per second, enabling deployment on Raspberry Pi and Jetson-class devices. Furthermore, when materials are regrouped into nine and five practical families, recall exceeds 98% and approaches 100%, directly supporting power and speed preset selection in laser cutters. These results demonstrate that compact, domain-specific CNNs can outperform large backbones for speckle-based material classification, advancing the feasibility of material-aware, edge-deployable laser cutting systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\u7528\u4e8e\u6fc0\u5149\u6563\u6591\u6750\u6599\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u572859\u7c7b\u6750\u6599\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523095.05%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4ec5341k\uff0c\u6bd4ResNet-50\u5c1170\u500d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u6fc0\u5149\u5207\u5272\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6750\u6599\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u5207\u5272\u8d28\u91cf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6563\u6591\u4f20\u611f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u9650\u6750\u6599\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u6563\u6591\u56fe\u6848\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u7684SensiCut\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0859\u7c7b\u6750\u6599\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u572859\u7c7b\u6750\u6599\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523095.05%\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0cF1\u5206\u65700.951\uff1b\u4ec5341k\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u7ea61.3MB\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6295\u56fe\u50cf/\u79d2\uff1b\u6750\u6599\u6309\u5b9e\u7528\u5bb6\u65cf\u5206\u7ec4\u65f6\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8d85\u8fc798%\u63a5\u8fd1100%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9aCNN\u5728\u6563\u6591\u6750\u6599\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u6750\u6599\u611f\u77e5\u6fc0\u5149\u5207\u5272\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Complete cross-compilation is often unfeasible due to ISA-specific code or missing dependencies, leaving programs with high emulation overhead.\n  We propose a hybrid execution system that combines compilation and emulation, featuring a selective function offloading mechanism. This mechanism establishes cross-environment calling channels, offloading eligible functions to the host for native execution to reduce DBT overhead. Key optimizations address offloading costs, enabling efficient hybrid operation. Built on LLVM and QEMU, the system works automatically for both applications and libraries.

The resulting KGs are compact, ontology-consistent, and well-connected; on MuSiQue, the correct answer entity appears in 96% of generated triplets. On HotpotQA, our triplets-only setup achieves 76.0 F1, and on MuSiQue 59.8 F1, matching or surpassing several retrieval-augmented generation baselines that still require textual context. In addition, Wikontic attains state-of-the-art information-retention performance on the MINE-1 benchmark (86%), outperforming prior KG construction methods. Wikontic is also efficient at build time: KG construction uses less than 1,000 output tokens, about 3$\\times$ fewer than AriGraph and $<$1/20 of GraphRAG.

Unlike conventional classifiers such as ICLabel, which rely on handcrafted features, ICVision directly interprets ICA dashboard visualizations topography, time series, power spectra, and ERP plots, using a multimodal large language model (GPT-4 Vision). This allows the AI to see and explain EEG components the way trained neurologists do, making it the first scientific implementation of AI-agent visual cognition in neurophysiology. ICVision classifies each component into one of six canonical categories (brain, eye, heart, muscle, channel noise, and other noise), returning both a confidence score and a human-like explanation. Evaluated on 3,168 ICA components from 124 EEG datasets, ICVision achieved k = 0.677 agreement with expert consensus, surpassing MNE ICLabel, while also preserving clinically relevant brain signals in ambiguous cases. Over 97% of its outputs were rated as interpretable and actionable by expert reviewers. As a core module of the open-source EEG Autoclean platform, ICVision signals a paradigm shift in scientific AI, where models do not just classify, but see, reason, and communicate. It opens the door to globally scalable, explainable, and reproducible EEG workflows, marking the emergence of AI agents capable of expert-level visual decision-making in brain science and beyond.", "AI": {"tldr": "ICVision\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9996\u521b\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7EEG ICA\u6210\u5206\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u8bfbICA\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfEEG ICA\u6210\u5206\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982ICLabel\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800cICVision\u65e8\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u795e\u7ecf\u5b66\u5bb6\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u8bfbEEG\u6210\u5206\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66AI\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u5206\u7c7b\u5411\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "method": "ICVision\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-4 Vision\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u8bfbICA\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5730\u5f62\u56fe\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3001\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u548cERP\u56fe\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6210\u5206\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u516d\u79cd\u6807\u51c6\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u5927\u8111\u3001\u773c\u775b\u3001\u5fc3\u810f\u3001\u808c\u8089\u3001\u901a\u9053\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5176\u4ed6\u566a\u58f0\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u7c7b\u4eba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728124\u4e2aEEG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76843,168\u4e2aICA\u6210\u5206\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cICVision\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5171\u8bc6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fbe\u5230\u03ba=0.677\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86MNE ICLabel\u3002\u8d85\u8fc797%\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u88ab\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5927\u8111\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "ICVision\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u79d1\u5b66AI\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u770b\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6c9f\u901a\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f00\u6e90EEG Autoclean\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b83\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684EEG\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u6253\u5f00\u4e86\u5927\u95e8\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u8111\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u3002"}}

This paper details the design, implementation, and evaluation of a 32-bit dual-stack microprocessor architecture optimized for low-cost, resource-constrained Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Implemented on the Gowin GW1NR-9 (Tang Nano 9K), the processor utilizes an instruction set architecture (ISA) inspired from a subset of the WebAssembly (WASM) specification to achieve high code density. Unlike traditional soft-cores that often rely on proprietary vendor toolchains and opaque IP blocks, this design is synthesized and routed utilizing an open-source flow, providing transparency and portability. The architecture features a dual-stack model (Data and Return), executing directly from SPI Flash via an Execute-in-Place (XIP) mechanism to conserve scarce Block RAM on the intended target device. An analysis of the trade-offs involved in stack depth parametrization is presented, demonstrating that an 8-entry distributed RAM implementation provides a balance between logic resource utilization ($\\sim 80\\%$) and routing congestion. Furthermore, timing hazards in single-cycle stack operations are identified and resolved through a refined Finite State Machine (FSM) design. The system achieves a stable operating frequency of 27 MHz, limited by Flash latency, and successfully executes simple applications including a single and multi-digit infix calculator.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6210\u672cFPGA\u4f18\u5316\u768432\u4f4d\u53cc\u6808\u5fae\u5904\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528WASM\u5b50\u96c6\u6307\u4ee4\u96c6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7801\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4eceSPI Flash\u76f4\u63a5\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u572827MHz\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6f\u6838\u5904\u7406\u5668\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684FPGA\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6210\u672cFPGA\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5904\u7406\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7801\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f00\u6e90\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u752832\u4f4d\u53cc\u6808\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u6570\u636e\u6808\u548c\u8fd4\u56de\u6808\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eWASM\u5b50\u96c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u4ee4\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Execute-in-Place\u673a\u5236\u76f4\u63a5\u4eceSPI Flash\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u5e03\u7ebf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6808\u6df1\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u5e8f\u5192\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u5728Gowin GW1NR-9 FPGA\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c8\u9879\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fRAM\u6808\u6df1\u5ea6\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff08\u7ea680%\uff09\u548c\u5e03\u7ebf\u62e5\u585e\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fd0\u884c\u9891\u738727MHz\uff08\u53d7Flash\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9650\u5236\uff09\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6267\u884c\u5355/\u591a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u7f00\u8ba1\u7b97\u5668\u7b49\u7b80\u5355\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650FPGA\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7801\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u5f00\u6e90\u900f\u660e\u5fae\u5904\u7406\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u53cc\u6808\u67b6\u6784\u548cXIP\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u8282\u7701Block RAM\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Rather than introducing ad hoc control constructs, Prism is built around a fixed core context, Core1, which provides a minimal background grammar of categories numbers, strings, user prompts, tools together with abstract combinators for booleans, predicates, pairs, and lists. Agent policies are written as ordinary expressions using a single abstraction operator so that conditionals appear as selections between alternatives instead of imperative if-else blocks. Domains extend the core by defining their own context-mini-grammars that introduce new categories, predicates, and external tools while reusing the same compositional machinery. We illustrate this with worked examples from thermostat control, home security, e-commerce recommendation, and medical monitoring, showing how natural language decision rules can be mapped to inspectable, executable policies. From a linguistic perspective, Prism enforces a clear separation between a reusable grammar-like core and domain specific lexicons and treats tools as bridges between internal policy representations and the external world. From an engineering perspective, it offers a compact interface language for agent control, making the space of possible actions explicit and amenable to analysis, verification, and safety constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "Prism\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u5143\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c4\u8303\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u5fc3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587Core1\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u7ec4\u5408\u5b50\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9886\u57df\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u5230\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u3001\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e34\u65f6\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u8bed\u8a00\u3002Prism\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u7684\u5143\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f7f\u4ee3\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u3001\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "Prism\u56f4\u7ed5\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587Core1\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6570\u5b57\u3001\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u3001\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u7b49\u57fa\u7840\u8bed\u6cd5\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e03\u5c14\u503c\u3001\u8c13\u8bcd\u3001\u5bf9\u3001\u5217\u8868\u7b49\u62bd\u8c61\u7ec4\u5408\u5b50\u3002\u4ee3\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u62bd\u8c61\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u7f16\u5199\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u8bed\u53e5\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5907\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u95f4\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u800c\u975e\u547d\u4ee4\u5f0fif-else\u5757\u3002\u9886\u57df\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5fae\u8bed\u6cd5\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u8c13\u8bcd\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91cd\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6052\u6e29\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u5bb6\u5ead\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u63a8\u8350\u548c\u533b\u7597\u76d1\u63a7\u7b49\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u5982\u4f55\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u3001\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u4ece\u8bed\u8a00\u89d2\u5ea6\u770b\uff0cPrism\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u8bed\u6cd5\u6838\u5fc3\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5c06\u5de5\u5177\u89c6\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6865\u6881\u3002\u4ece\u5de5\u7a0b\u89d2\u5ea6\u770b\uff0c\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u63a5\u53e3\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f7f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5f97\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "Prism\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u89c4\u8303\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u5fc3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u9886\u57df\u6269\u5c55\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u51b3\u7b56\u5230\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

We introduce Mammo-FM, the first foundation model specifically for mammography, pretrained on the largest and most diverse dataset to date - 140,677 patients (821,326 mammograms) across four U.S. institutions. Mammo-FM provides a unified foundation for core clinical tasks in breast imaging, including cancer diagnosis, pathology localization, structured report generation, and cancer risk prognosis within a single framework. Its alignment between images and text enables both visual and textual interpretability, improving transparency and clinical auditability, which are essential for real-world adoption. We rigorously evaluate Mammo-FM across diagnosis, prognosis, and report-generation tasks in in- and out-of-distribution datasets. Despite operating on native-resolution mammograms and using only one-third of the parameters of state-of-the-art generalist FMs, Mammo-FM consistently outperforms them across multiple public and private benchmarks.

However, existing designs suffer from memristor access overhead due to the large number of graph partitions. This leads to increased execution time, higher energy consumption, and re-duced circuit lifetime. This paper proposes a graph processing method that minimizes memristor write operations by identifying frequent subgraph patterns and assigning them to graph engines, referred to as static, allowing most subgraphs to be processed without a need for crossbar reconfiguration. Experimental results show speed up to 2.38x speedup and 7.23x energy savings com-pared to state-of-the-art accelerators. Furthermore, our method extends the circuit lifetime by 2x compared to state-of-the-art ReRAM graph accelerators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eReRAM\u7684\u56fe\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u9891\u7e41\u5b50\u56fe\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u9759\u6001\u5206\u914d\u5230\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5199\u5165\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u5e76\u5ef6\u957f\u7535\u8def\u5bff\u547d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ReRAM\u56fe\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u56fe\u5206\u533a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5fc6\u963b\u5668\u8bbf\u95ee\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u80fd\u8017\u5e76\u7f29\u77ed\u7535\u8def\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5199\u5165\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u9891\u7e41\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u9759\u6001\u5206\u914d\u5230\u56fe\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f15\u64ce\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5b50\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u4ea4\u53c9\u5f00\u5173\u9635\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad82.38\u500d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c7.23\u500d\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u7535\u8def\u5bff\u547d\u5ef6\u957f\u4e862\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u5fc6\u963b\u5668\u5199\u5165\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347ReRAM\u56fe\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, single-model responses often exhibit inconsistencies, hallucinations, and varying quality across different query domains. This paper presents ART (Adaptive Response Tuning), a novel framework that employs tournament-style ELO ranking and multi-agent reasoning to systematically optimize LLM outputs. By enabling multiple LLM agents to compete, critique, and collaborate through structured tournament workflows, ART produces consensus responses that outperform individual model outputs. Our framework introduces configurable tournament parameters, dynamic agent selection, and multiple consensus fusion strategies. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in response accuracy, coherence, and reliability compared to baseline single-model approaches.

High-quality data plays an important role in driving the development of the 3D understanding community. Current 3D scene understanding datasets often provide geometric and instance-level information, yet they lack the rich semantic annotations necessary for nuanced visual-language tasks.In this work, we introduce DenseScan, a novel dataset with detailed multi-level descriptions generated by an automated pipeline leveraging multi-view 2D images and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach enables dense captioning of scene elements, ensuring comprehensive object-level descriptions that capture context-sensitive details. Furthermore, we extend these annotations through scenario-based question generation, producing high-level queries that integrate object properties, spatial relationships, and scene context. By coupling geometric detail with semantic richness, DenseScan broadens the range of downstream tasks, from detailed visual-language navigation to interactive question answering. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances object-level understanding and question-answering performance in 3D environments compared to traditional annotation pipelines. We release both the annotated dataset and our annotation pipeline to facilitate future research and applications in robotics, augmented reality, and beyond.

Preserving this fine granularity necessitated the introduction of bank groups and pseudo channels. These structures expand timing parameters and control overhead, significantly increasing memory controller scheduling complexity. Large language models (LLMs) now dominate deep learning workloads, streaming contiguous data blocks ranging from several kilobytes to megabytes per operation. In a conventional HBM-based memory system, these transfers are fragmented into hundreds of 32B cache line transactions. This forces the memory controller to employ unnecessarily intricate scheduling, leading to growing inefficiency.\n  To address this problem, we propose RoMe. RoMe accesses DRAM at row granularity and removes columns, bank groups, and pseudo channels from the memory interface. This design simplifies memory scheduling, thereby requiring fewer pins per channel. The freed pins are aggregated to form additional channels, increasing overall bandwidth by 12.5% with minimal extra pins. RoMe demonstrates how memory scheduling logic can be significantly simplified for representative LLM workloads, and presents an alternative approach for next-generation HBM-based memory systems achieving increased bandwidth with minimal hardware overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "RoMe\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u578bHBM\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bbf\u95ee\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7f13\u5b58\u884c\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u5185\u5b58\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5f15\u811a\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7528\u8282\u7701\u7684\u5f15\u811a\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b012.5%\u5e26\u5bbd\u63d0\u5347", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3HBM\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u6301\u7f13\u5b58\u884c\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684bank\u7ec4\u548c\u4f2a\u901a\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u65f6\u5e8f\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u8fde\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u5757\u4f20\u8f93\uff08KB\u5230MB\u7ea7\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f20\u7edfHBM\u4e2d\u88ab\u5206\u5272\u6210\u6570\u767e\u4e2a32B\u7f13\u5b58\u884c\u4e8b\u52a1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u8c03\u5ea6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRoMe\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1\uff09\u4ee5\u884c\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bbf\u95eeDRAM\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u5217\u3001bank\u7ec4\u548c\u4f2a\u901a\u9053\uff1b2\uff09\u7b80\u5316\u5185\u5b58\u8c03\u5ea6\u903b\u8f91\uff1b3\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u6bcf\u4e2a\u901a\u9053\u6240\u9700\u5f15\u811a\u6570\uff1b4\uff09\u5229\u7528\u8282\u7701\u7684\u5f15\u811a\u5f62\u6210\u989d\u5916\u901a\u9053", "result": "RoMe\u663e\u8457\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u8c03\u5ea6\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u989d\u5916\u5f15\u811a\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u589e\u52a0\u4e8612.5%\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3HBM\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848", "conclusion": "RoMe\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u8c03\u5ea6\u903b\u8f91\u53ef\u4ee5\u5927\u5e45\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u9500\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u5e26\u5bbd\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3HBM\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

In enterprise settings, they are frequently augmented with closed-source domain knowledge to deliver more contextually informed responses. However, operational constraints such as limited context windows and inconsistencies between pre-training data and supplied knowledge often lead to hallucinations, some of which appear highly credible and escape routine human review. Current mitigation strategies either depend on costly, large-scale gold-standard Q\\&A curation or rely on secondary model verification, neither of which offers deterministic assurance. This paper introduces a framework that organizes proprietary knowledge and model-generated content into interactive visual knowledge graphs. The objective is to provide end users with a clear, intuitive view of potential hallucination zones by linking model assertions to underlying sources of truth and indicating confidence levels. Through this visual interface, users can diagnose inconsistencies, identify weak reasoning chains, and supply corrective feedback.

In contrast to classical one-light-at-a-time (OLAT)-based human relighting, our transformer-based RelightNet predicts relit appearance within a single network pass, avoiding costly OLAT-basis capture and generation. For training such a model, we introduce a new capture strategy and dataset recorded in a multi-view lightstage, where we alternate frames lit by random environment maps with uniformly lit tracking frames, simultaneously enabling accurate motion tracking and diverse illumination as well as dynamics coverage. Inspired by the rendering equation, we derive physics-informed features that encode geometry, albedo, shading, and the virtual camera view from a coarse human mesh proxy and the input views. Our RelightNet then takes these features as input and cross-attends them with a novel lighting condition, and regresses the relit appearance in the form of texel-aligned 3D Gaussian splats attached to the coarse mesh proxy. Consequently, our RelightNet implicitly learns to efficiently compute the rendering equation for novel lighting conditions within a single feed-forward pass. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior visual fidelity and lighting reproduction compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

ImageNet-pretrained models provide rich visual representations, but adapting them to heterogeneous modalities such as hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) without large labeled datasets remains challenging. We propose UniDiff, a parameter-efficient framework that adapts a single ImageNet-pretrained diffusion model to multiple sensing modalities using only target-domain data. UniDiff combines FiLM-based timestep-modality conditioning, parameter-efficient adaptation of approximately 5% of parameters, and pseudo-RGB anchoring to preserve pre-trained representations and prevent catastrophic forgetting. This design enables effective feature extraction from remote sensing data under sparse annotations. Our results with two established multi-modal benchmarking datasets demonstrate that unsupervised adaptation of a pre-trained diffusion model effectively mitigates annotation constraints and achieves effective fusion of multi-modal remotely sensed data.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniDiff\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5e94\u5355\u4e2aImageNet\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u9065\u611f\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u6ce8\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u6ce8\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9065\u611f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982MSFMamba\u4e5f\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002ImageNet\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e30\u5bcc\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u9002\u5e94\u5f02\u8d28\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6210\u50cf\u548c\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\u96f7\u8fbe\uff09\u800c\u65e0\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "UniDiff\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408FiLM-based\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65-\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3001\u4ec5\u9002\u5e94\u7ea65%\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f2aRGB\u951a\u5b9a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u6ce8\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9065\u611f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "UniDiff\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u5355\u4e2aImageNet\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u9065\u611f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9065\u611f\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Goto, Sci. Adv. 10, eadp6388 (2024)], concatenated ${[[n,n-2,2]]}$ quantum error-detecting codes ($n$ is even), have recently been proposed as high-rate quantum codes suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the original many-hypercube codes with ${n=6}$ have large code block sizes at high concatenation levels (216 and 1296 physical qubits per block at levels 3 and 4, respectively), making not only experimental realization difficult but also logical error rates high. Toward earlier experimental realization and lower logical error rates, here we investigate smaller many-hypercube codes obtained by concatenating $[[6,4,2]]$ and/or $[[4,2,2]]$ codes, where, e.g., $D_{6,4,4}$ denotes the many-hypercube code using $[[6,4,2]]$ at level 1 and $[[4,2,2]]$ at levels 2 and 3. As a result, we found a surprising fact: $D_{6,4,4}$ ($D_{6,6,4,4}$) can achieve lower block error rates than $D_{4,4,4}$ ($D_{4,4,4,4}$), despite its higher encoding rate. Focusing on level 3, we also developed efficient fault-tolerant encoders realizing about 60% overhead reduction while maintaining or even improving the performance, compared to the original design. Using them, we numerically confirmed that $D_{6,4,4}$ also achieves the best performance for logical controlled-NOT gates in a circuit-level noise model. These results will be useful for early experimental realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing with high-rate quantum codes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528[[6,4,2]]\u548c[[4,2,2]]\u7801\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u66f4\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u7801\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0D_{6,4,4}\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7f16\u7801\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5757\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u539f\u59cb\u591a\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u7801\u4f7f\u7528[[n,n-2,2]]\u7801(n=6)\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8054\u7ea7\u522b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279(216\u548c1296)\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u9ad8\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u591a\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u7801\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u65e9\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea7\u8054[[6,4,2]]\u548c/\u6216[[4,2,2]]\u7801\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u591a\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u7801\uff0c\u5982D_{6,4,4}\u8868\u793a\u5728\u7b2c1\u7ea7\u4f7f\u7528[[6,4,2]]\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u7b2c2\u548c3\u7ea7\u4f7f\u7528[[4,2,2]]\u7801\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea660%\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0D_{6,4,4}\u548cD_{6,6,4,4}\u6bd4D_{4,4,4}\u548cD_{4,4,4,4}\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5757\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5176\u7f16\u7801\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\u5728\u7535\u8def\u7ea7\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0cD_{6,4,4}\u5728\u903b\u8f91CNOT\u95e8\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u7f16\u7801\u7387\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u66f4\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u7801\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

With only three lines of framework-specific code, the model was adapted from Bangla to Hindi, demonstrating effective portability with minimal modification. The framework achieves 96.85 percent and 97 percent token-level accuracy across POS categories in Bangla and Hindi while sustaining strong F1 scores despite dataset imbalance and linguistic overlap. A performance discrepancy in a specific POS category underscores ongoing challenges in dataset curation. The strong results stem from the underlying transformer architecture, which can be replaced with limited code adjustments.

This work addresses a long-standing limitation in conventional cine MRI, which typically provides only 2D slice images of the heart, thereby restricting a comprehensive understanding of cardiac morphology and physiological mechanisms in both healthy and pathological conditions. To overcome this, we propose \\textbf{HeartFormer}, a novel point cloud completion network that extends traditional single-class point cloud completion to the multi-class. HeartFormer consists of two key components: a Semantic-Aware Dual-Structure Transformer Network (SA-DSTNet) and a Semantic-Aware Geometry Feature Refinement Transformer Network (SA-GFRTNet). SA-DSTNet generates an initial coarse point cloud with both global geometry features and substructure geometry features. Guided by these semantic-geometry representations, SA-GFRTNet progressively refines the coarse output, effectively leveraging both global and substructure geometric priors to produce high-fidelity and geometrically consistent reconstructions. We further construct \\textbf{HeartCompv1}, the first publicly available large-scale dataset with 17,000 high-resolution 3D multi-class cardiac meshes and point-clouds, to establish a general benchmark for this emerging research direction. Extensive cross-domain experiments on HeartCompv1 and UK Biobank demonstrate that HeartFormer achieves robust, accurate, and generalizable performance, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

However, paired pathological-healthy data are extremely difficult to obtain, as they rely on pre- and post-treatment imaging, constrained by clinical outcomes and longitudinal data availability. Consequently, most existing brain image generation and editing methods focus on visual quality yet remain domain-specific, treating pathological and healthy image modeling independently. We introduce USB (Unified Synthetic Brain), the first end-to-end framework that unifies bidirectional generation and editing of pathological and healthy brain images. USB models the joint distribution of lesions and brain anatomy through a paired diffusion mechanism and achieves both pathological and healthy image generation. A consistency guidance algorithm further preserves anatomical consistency and lesion correspondence during bidirectional pathology-healthy editing. Extensive experiments on six public brain MRI datasets including healthy controls, stroke, and Alzheimer's patients, demonstrate USB's ability to produce diverse and realistic results. By establishing the first unified benchmark for brain image generation and editing, USB opens opportunities for scalable dataset creation and robust neuroimaging analysis.

By leveraging a dynamic mix of 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point computations, AMP lowers GPU memory requirements and speeds up training without degrading model performance. We evaluate AMP across four standard Bangla NLP tasks, namely sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, error classification, and question answering, using four transformer-based models: BanglaBERT, BanglishBERT, XLM-R, and mBERT. Our results demonstrate that AMP accelerates training by 44.5% and reduces memory consumption by 17.6%, while maintaining F-1 score within 99.7% of the full-precision baselines.

By embedding identifiable signals into model outputs, watermarking enables reliable attribution and enhances the security of machine-generated content. Existing approaches typically embed signals by manipulating token generation probabilities. Despite their effectiveness, these methods inherently face a trade-off between detectability and text quality: the signal strength and randomness required for robust watermarking tend to degrade the performance of downstream tasks.\n  In this paper, we design a novel embedding scheme that controls seed pools to facilitate diverse parallel generation of watermarked text. Based on that scheme, we propose WaterSearch, a sentence-level, search-based watermarking framework adaptable to a wide range of existing methods. WaterSearch enhances text quality by jointly optimizing two key aspects: 1) distribution fidelity and 2) watermark signal characteristics. Furthermore, WaterSearch is complemented by a sentence-level detection method with strong attack robustness. We evaluate our method on three popular LLMs across ten diverse tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an average performance improvement of 51.01\\% over state-of-the-art baselines at a watermark detectability strength of 95\\%. In challenging scenarios such as short text generation and low-entropy output generation, our method yields performance gains of 47.78\\% and 36.47\\%, respectively. Moreover, under different attack senarios including insertion, synonym substitution and paraphrase attasks, WaterSearch maintains high detectability, further validating its robust anti-attack capabilities.

Trained and evaluated on 25,709 scans with 69,449 annotated nodules, the system outperforms radiologists, Lung-RADS, and leading AI models (Sybil, Brock, Google, Kaggle). It achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.98 internally and 0.945 on an independent cohort. With 0.5 false positives per scan at 99.3\\% sensitivity, it addresses key barriers to AI adoption. Critically, it outperforms radiologists across all nodule sizes and stages, excelling in stage 1 cancers, and all growth-based metrics, including the least accurate: Volume-Doubling Time.

It constructs dynamic AR scene graphs encoding nine typed relations (spatial, structural-semantic, causal-functional), enabling MLLMs to understand not just what objects exist, but how they relate and interact in 3D space. Through task-adaptive region-of-interest highlighting and contextual spatial retrieval, the system guides human attention to information-dense areas while supporting human-in-the-loop refinement. The agent dynamically invokes coordinate-aware tools for complex queries-selection, measurement, comparison, and actuation-grounding language understanding in physical operations. The modular architecture supports plug-and-use vision-language models without retraining, establishing AR agents as intermediaries that augment MLLMs with real-world spatial intelligence for interactive scene understanding. We also introduce GroundedAR-Bench, an evaluation framework for language-driven real world localization and relation grounding across diverse environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316AR\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u7a7a\u95f4\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u5230\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6216\u6807\u8bb0\u7269\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u3002\u9700\u8981\u589e\u5f3aAR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u6a21\u5757\u5316AR\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6574\u5408MLLMs\u4e0e\u5750\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001AR\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u4e5d\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u7ed3\u6784-\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u56e0\u679c-\u529f\u80fd\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u8c03\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u5177\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u9ad8\u4eae\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a7a\u95f4\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u5230\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de\u7c73\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76843D\u951a\u70b9\u3002\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u73af\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5750\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u5de5\u5177\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u63d0\u51faGroundedAR-Bench\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u652f\u6301\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5c06AR\u4ee3\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u4ecb\uff0c\u4e3aMLLMs\u589e\u5f3a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u57fa\u7840\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Single-server PIR based on homomorphic encryption has particularly gained immense attention for its ease of deployment and reduced trust assumptions. However, single-server PIR remains impractical due to its high computational and memory bandwidth demands. Specifically, reading the entirety of large databases from storage, such as SSDs, severely limits its performance. To address this, we propose IVE, an accelerator for single-server PIR with a systematic extension that enables practical retrieval from large databases using DRAM. Recent advances in DRAM capacity allow PIR for large databases to be served entirely from DRAM, removing its dependence on storage bandwidth. Although the memory bandwidth bottleneck still remains, multi-client batching effectively amortizes database access costs across concurrent requests to improve throughput. However, client-specific data remains a bottleneck, whose bandwidth requirements ultimately limits performance. IVE overcomes this by employing a large on-chip scratchpad with an operation scheduling algorithm that maximizes data reuse, further boosting throughput. Additionally, we introduce sysNTTU, a versatile functional unit that enhances area efficiency without sacrificing performance. We also propose a heterogeneous memory system architecture, which enables a linear scaling of database sizes without a throughput degradation. Consequently, IVE achieves up to 1,275x higher throughput compared to prior PIR hardware solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "IVE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\uff08PIR\uff09\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DRAM\u5b58\u50a8\u3001\u591a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6279\u5904\u7406\u3001\u7247\u4e0a\u6682\u5b58\u5668\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u529f\u80fd\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u670d\u52a1\u5668PIR\u867d\u7136\u90e8\u7f72\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u4fe1\u4efb\u5047\u8bbe\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u8bfb\u53d6\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4eceSSD\u7b49\u5b58\u50a8\u8bbe\u5907\u8bfb\u53d6\u5927\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIVE\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528DRAM\u5b58\u50a8\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u5b58\u50a8\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\uff1b2) \u591a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6279\u5904\u7406\u5206\u644a\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8bbf\u95ee\u6210\u672c\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u5927\u5bb9\u91cf\u7247\u4e0a\u6682\u5b58\u5668\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6570\u636e\u590d\u7528\uff1b4) \u8bbe\u8ba1sysNTTU\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u5355\u5143\u63d0\u9ad8\u9762\u79ef\u6548\u7387\uff1b5) \u63d0\u51fa\u5f02\u6784\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u652f\u6301\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "IVE\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684PIR\u786c\u4ef6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe1,275\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "IVE\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u670d\u52a1\u5668PIR\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Most existing Gaussian-based methods rely on random initialization of many primitives within predefined spatial bounds, resulting in redundancy and poor scalability to unbounded scenes. Recent depth-guided approach alleviates this issue but remains local, suffering from latency and memory overhead as scale increases. To overcome these challenges, we propose TGSFormer, a scalable Temporal Gaussian Splatting framework for embodied SSC. It maintains a persistent Gaussian memory for temporal prediction, without relying on image coherence or frame caches. For temporal fusion, a Dual Temporal Encoder jointly processes current and historical Gaussian features through confidence-aware cross-attention. Subsequently, a Confidence-aware Voxel Fusion module merges overlapping primitives into voxel-aligned representations, regulating density and maintaining compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TGSFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on both local and embodied SSC benchmarks, offering superior accuracy and scalability with significantly fewer primitives while maintaining consistent long-term scene integrity.

Emerging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) technologies have received lots of attention in recent years, where Racetrack Memory (RTM) is among the most promising ones. RTM has the highest density among all NVMs and its access performance is comparable to SRAM technology. Therefore, RTM is a suitable alternative for SRAM in the Last-Level Caches (LLCs). Despite all its benefits, RTM confronts different reliability challenges due to the stochastic behavior of its storage element and highly error-prone data shifting, leading to a high probability of multiple-bit errors. Conventional Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) are either incapable of tolerating multiple-bit errors or require a large amount of extra storage for check bits. This paper proposes taking advantage of value locality for compressing data blocks and freeing up a large fraction of cache blocks for storing data redundancy of strong ECCs. Utilizing the proposed scheme, a large majority of cache blocks are protected by strong ECCs to tolerate multiple-bit errors without any storage overhead. The evaluation using gem5 full-system simulator demonstrates that the proposed scheme enhances the mean-time-to-failure of the cache by an average of 11.3x with less than 1% hardware and performance overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u6570\u503c\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u538b\u7f29\u6570\u636e\u5757\uff0c\u817e\u51fa\u7f13\u5b58\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b58\u50a8\u5f3aECC\u6821\u9a8c\u4f4d\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347Racetrack\u5185\u5b58\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "motivation": "Racetrack\u5185\u5b58(RTM)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3SRAM\u7684\u672b\u7ea7\u7f13\u5b58\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5bc6\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1SRAM\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4f20\u7edfECC\u8981\u4e48\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bb9\u5fcd\u591a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u989d\u5916\u5b58\u50a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6570\u503c\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u538b\u7f29\u6570\u636e\u5757\uff0c\u91ca\u653e\u51fa\u5927\u91cf\u7f13\u5b58\u5757\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u5b58\u50a8\u5f3aECC\u7684\u6821\u9a8c\u4f4d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7f13\u5b58\u5757\u90fd\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53d7\u5230\u5f3aECC\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bb9\u5fcd\u591a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528gem5\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u5c06\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6545\u969c\u95f4\u9694\u65f6\u95f4(MTTF)\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e8611.3\u500d\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u5f00\u9500\u5747\u4f4e\u4e8e1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RTM\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u591a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6570\u503c\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u538b\u7f29\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3aECC\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f13\u5b58\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

This research project investigates whether prompt engineering (PE) methods can mitigate context inconsistency hallucinations in zero-shot LLM summarisation of scientific texts, where zero-shot indicates that the LLM relies purely on its pre-training data. Across eight yeast biotechnology research paper abstracts, six instruction-tuned LLMs were prompted with seven methods: a base- line prompt, two levels of increasing instruction complexity (PE-1 and PE-2), two levels of context repetition (CR-K1 and CR-K2), and two levels of random addition (RA-K1 and RA-K2). Context repetition involved the identification and repetition of K key sentences from the abstract, whereas random addition involved the repetition of K randomly selected sentences from the abstract, where K is 1 or 2. A total of 336 LLM-generated summaries were evaluated using six metrics: ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, METEOR, and cosine similarity, which were used to compute the lexical and semantic alignment be- tween the summaries and the abstracts. Four hypotheses on the effects of prompt methods on summary alignment with the reference text were tested. Statistical analysis on 3744 collected datapoints was performed using bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni-Holm correction. The results demonstrated that CR and RA significantly improve the lexical alignment of LLM-generated summaries with the abstracts. These findings indicate that prompt engineering has the potential to impact hallucinations in zero-shot scientific summarisation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5426\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6dfb\u52a0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6458\u8981\u4e0e\u539f\u6587\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75288\u7bc7\u9175\u6bcd\u751f\u7269\u6280\u672f\u8bba\u6587\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5bf96\u4e2a\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u75287\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u4e24\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9012\u589e\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\uff08PE-1\u548cPE-2\uff09\u3001\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91cd\u590d\uff08CR-K1\u548cCR-K2\uff09\u3001\u4e24\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u6dfb\u52a0\uff08RA-K1\u548cRA-K2\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc76\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08ROUGE-1/2/L\u3001BERTScore\u3001METEOR\u3001\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30336\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528BCa\u81ea\u52a9\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u548cWilcoxon\u7b26\u53f7\u79e9\u68c0\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91cd\u590d\uff08CR\uff09\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6dfb\u52a0\uff08RA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6458\u8981\u4e0e\u539f\u6587\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u3002\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u4e8e3744\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u79d1\u5b66\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u590d\u5173\u952e\u53e5\u5b50\u6216\u968f\u673a\u6dfb\u52a0\u53e5\u5b50\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent methods for large-scale datasets focus on matching global distributional statistics (e.g., mean and variance), but overlook critical instance-level characteristics and intraclass variations, leading to suboptimal generalization. We address this limitation by reformulating dataset distillation as an Optimal Transport (OT) distance minimization problem, enabling fine-grained alignment at both global and instance levels throughout the pipeline. OT offers a geometrically faithful framework for distribution matching. It effectively preserves local modes, intra-class patterns, and fine-grained variations that characterize the geometry of complex, high-dimensional distributions. Our method comprises three components tailored for preserving distributional geometry: (1) OT-guided diffusion sampling, which aligns latent distributions of real and distilled images; (2) label-image-aligned soft relabeling, which adapts label distributions based on the complexity of distilled image distributions; and (3) OT-based logit matching, which aligns the output of student models with soft-label distributions. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures and large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in an efficient manner, achieving at least 4% accuracy improvement under IPC=10 settings for each architecture on ImageNet-1K.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff08OT\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728ImageNet-1K\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u81f3\u5c114%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5339\u914d\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u5e03\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u5747\u503c\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7c7b\u5185\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u8ddd\u79bb\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1aOT\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u6807\u7b7e-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8f6f\u91cd\u6807\u8bb0\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eOT\u7684logit\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728IPC=10\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67b6\u6784\u5728ImageNet-1K\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u81f3\u5c114%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Second supervisor: David Weir", "summary": "Transformer models have significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), demonstrating strong performance in English. However, their effectiveness in Arabic, particularly for Named Entity Recognition (NER), remains limited, even with larger pre-trained models. This performance gap stems from multiple factors, including tokenisation, dataset quality, and annotation inconsistencies. Existing studies often analyze these issues in isolation, failing to capture their joint effect on system behaviour and performance.\n  We introduce DeformAr (Debugging and Evaluation Framework for Transformer-based NER Systems), a novel framework designed to investigate and explain the performance discrepancy between Arabic and English NER systems. DeformAr integrates a data extraction library and an interactive dashboard, supporting two modes of evaluation: cross-component analysis and behavioural analysis. The framework divides each language into dataset and model components to examine their interactions.\n  The analysis proceeds in two stages. First, cross-component analysis provides systematic diagnostic measures across data and model subcomponents, addressing the \"what,\" \"how,\" and \"why\" behind observed discrepancies. The second stage applies behavioural analysis by combining interpretability techniques with token-level metrics, interactive visualisations, and representation space analysis. These stages enable a component-aware diagnostic process that detects model behaviours and explains them by linking them to underlying representational patterns and data factors. DeformAr is the first Arabic-specific, component-based interpretability tool, offering a crucial resource for advancing model analysis in under-resourced languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeformAr\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u8c03\u8bd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\uff08NER\uff09Transformer\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u4e0e\u82f1\u8bedNER\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u82f1\u8bedNLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bedNER\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u6e90\u4e8e\u5206\u8bcd\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u591a\u91cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5f80\u5f80\u5b64\u7acb\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDeformAr\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u5e93\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4eea\u8868\u677f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e24\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u8de8\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6bcf\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6765\u68c0\u67e5\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u5206\u6790\u5206\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1\uff09\u8de8\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u6807\uff1b2\uff09\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\u3001token\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "DeformAr\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u56e0\u7d20\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ec4\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u8fdb\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bedNLP\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Synthetic anomaly-based methods exhibit a unique capacity to introduce controllable irregularities with known masks, enabling explicit supervision during training. However, existing methods often produce synthetic anomalies that are visually distinct from real pathological patterns and ignore anatomical structure. This paper presents a novel Anatomy-aware Realistic Texture-based Anomaly Synthesis framework (ART-ASyn) for chest X-rays that generates realistic and anatomically consistent lung opacity related anomalies using texture-based augmentation guided by our proposed Progressive Binary Thresholding Segmentation method (PBTSeg) for lung segmentation. The generated paired samples of synthetic anomalies and their corresponding precise pixel-level anomaly mask for each normal sample enable explicit segmentation supervision. In contrast to prior work limited to one-class classification, ART-ASyn is further evaluated for zero-shot anomaly segmentation, demonstrating generalizability on an unseen dataset without target-domain annotations.

However, their performance is dependent on large computational resources and proprietary datasets, which are costly, restricted, and therefore inacces- sible to many researchers and practitioners. To reflect realistic situations we investigate the ability of lightweight open-source LLMs - smaller and publicly available models designed to operate with limited computational resources - to generalize sentiment understanding from financial datasets of varying sizes, sources, formats, and languages. We compare the benchmark finance natural language processing (NLP) model, FinBERT, and three open-source lightweight LLMs, DeepSeek-LLM 7B, Llama3 8B Instruct, and Qwen3 8B on five publicly available datasets: FinancialPhraseBank, Financial Question Answering, Gold News Sentiment, Twitter Sentiment and Chinese Finance Sentiment.

This point-to-point correspondence between two consecutive frames can be costly to compute and suffers from varying accuracy, which affects the odometry estimate's quality. Attempts have been made to bypass the difficulties originating from the correspondence problem by adopting line features and fusing other sensors (event camera, IMU) to improve performance, many of which still heavily rely on correspondence. If the camera observes a straight line as it moves, the image of the line sweeps a smooth surface in image-space time. It is a ruled surface and analyzing its shape gives information about odometry. Further, its estimation requires only differentially computed updates from point-to-line associations. Inspired by event cameras' propensity for edge detection, this research presents a novel algorithm to reconstruct 3D scenes and visual odometry from these ruled surfaces. By constraining the surfaces with the inertia measurements from an onboard IMU sensor, the dimensionality of the solution space is greatly reduced.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f4\u7ebf\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u56fe\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u76f4\u7eb9\u66f2\u9762\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5f81\u70b9\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5149\u6d41\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u7279\u5f81\u6216\u878d\u5408\u5176\u4ed6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u95ee\u9898\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u673a\u89c2\u5bdf\u76f4\u7ebf\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u76f4\u7eb9\u66f2\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u70b9-\u7ebf\u5173\u8054\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u66f2\u9762\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528IMU\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u66f2\u9762\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u76f4\u7eb9\u66f2\u9762\u91cd\u5efa3D\u573a\u666f\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7IMU\u7ea6\u675f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u76f4\u7ebf\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u76f4\u7eb9\u66f2\u9762\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite that, in this work, by showing a probing experiment on our proposed StructQA benchmark, we postulate that even the most advanced LLMs (such as GPTs) may still fall short of coping with tabular data. More specifically, the current scheme often simply relies on serializing the tabular data, together with the meta information, then inputting them through the LLMs. We argue that the loss of structural information is the root of this shortcoming. In this work, we further propose TAMO, which bears an ideology to treat the tables as an independent modality integrated with the text tokens. The resulting model in TAMO is a multimodal framework consisting of a hypergraph neural network as the global table encoder seamlessly integrated with the mainstream LLM.

Existing synthetic video datasets predominantly focus on the visual modality alone, while the few incorporating audio are largely confined to facial deepfakes--a limitation that fails to address the expanding landscape of general multimodal AI-generated content and substantially impedes the development of trustworthy detection systems. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the Multimodal Video-Audio Dataset (MVAD), the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed for detecting AI-generated multimodal video-audio content. Our dataset exhibits three key characteristics: (1) genuine multimodality with samples generated according to three realistic video-audio forgery patterns; (2) high perceptual quality achieved through diverse state-of-the-art generative models; and (3) comprehensive diversity spanning realistic and anime visual styles, four content categories (humans, animals, objects, and scenes), and four video-audio multimodal data types.

First, existing benchmarks often focus narrowly on retrieval while neglecting high-level planning and reasoning. Second, existing benchmarks favor general domains over the scientific domains that are the core application for DR agents. To address these gaps, we introduce Dr.Mi-Bench, a Modular-integrated benchmark for scientific DR agents. Grounded in academic literature, our benchmark uses a human-annotated dataset of 200 instances across 10 scientific domains, including both research and review papers. Besides, we also propose a Modular-integrated Evaluation Paradigm for DR Agents (Dr.Mi-Eval), a novel modular-integrated evaluation paradigm, which leverages the rich structure of academic papers to assess the core competencies of planning, retrieval, and reasoning through two complementary modes: an end-to-end evaluation for DR agents and an isolated evaluation for foundational LLMs as potential backbones. Experimental results reveal a fragmented performance landscape: agents exhibit specialized strengths but share critical weaknesses, most notably in performing the multi-source retrieval required for review-style tasks and performing consistently across diverse scientific fields. Moreover, improving high-level planning capability is the crucial factor for unlocking the reasoning potential of foundational LLMs as backbones. By exposing these actionable failure modes, Dr.Mi-Bench provides a diagnostic tool to guide the development of more reliable academic research assistants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Dr.Mi-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5305\u542b200\u4e2a\u8de810\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u96c6\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0fDr.Mi-Eval\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u68c0\u7d22\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u63a8\u7406\uff1b2\uff09\u504f\u5411\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u800c\u975e\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u800c\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u6b63\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u672f\u6587\u732e\u6784\u5efaDr.Mi-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b200\u4e2a\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d610\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u7efc\u8ff0\u8bba\u6587\u3002\u63d0\u51faDr.Mi-Eval\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u672f\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9694\u79bb\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff1a\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5171\u540c\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7efc\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u591a\u6e90\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u8de8\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u91ca\u653e\u57fa\u7840LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9aa8\u5e72\u63a8\u7406\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "Dr.Mi-Bench\u901a\u8fc7\u63ed\u793a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u52a9\u624b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6307\u5bfc\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Given a model fine-tuned by an untrusted third party, determining whether the model has been injected with a backdoor is a critical and challenging problem. Existing detection methods usually rely on prior knowledge of training dataset, backdoor triggers and targets, or downstream classifiers, which may be impractical for real-world applications. To address this, To address this challenge, we introduce Assimilation Matters in DETection (AMDET), a novel model-level detection framework that operates without any such prior knowledge. Specifically, we first reveal the feature assimilation property in backdoored text encoders: the representations of all tokens within a backdoor sample exhibit a high similarity. Further analysis attributes this effect to the concentration of attention weights on the trigger token. Leveraging this insight, AMDET scans a model by performing gradient-based inversion on token embeddings to recover implicit features that capable of activating backdoor behaviors. Furthermore, we identify the natural backdoor feature in the OpenAI's official CLIP model, which are not intentionally injected but still exhibit backdoor-like behaviors. We then filter them out from real injected backdoor by analyzing their loss landscapes. Extensive experiments on 3,600 backdoored and benign-finetuned models with two attack paradigms and three VLP model structures show that AMDET detects backdoors with an F1 score of 89.90%. Besides, it achieves one complete detection in approximately 5 minutes on a RTX 4090 GPU and exhibits strong robustness against adaptive attacks.

This research expands that scope in two directions: first, by comparing two retrieval strategies, Graph RAG, structured knowledge-graph based, and Advanced RAG, hybrid keyword-semantic search, for QA; and second, by evaluating whether LLMs can generate high quality non-traditional academic outputs, specifically slide decks and podcast scripts. We implemented a prototype combining Meta's LLaMA 3 70B open weight and OpenAI's GPT 4o mini API based. QA performance was evaluated using both human ratings across eleven quality dimensions and large language model judges for scalable cross validation. GPT 4o mini with Advanced RAG produced the most accurate responses. Graph RAG offered limited improvements and led to more hallucinations, partly due to its structural complexity and manual setup. Slide and podcast generation was tested with document grounded retrieval. GPT 4o mini again performed best, though LLaMA 3 showed promise in narrative coherence.

Motivated by the robustness and privacy-preserving nature of millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar, this work introduces radar as a novel sensing modality for HMP, for the first time. Nevertheless, radar signals often suffer from specular reflections and multipath effects, resulting in noisy and temporally inconsistent measurements, such as body-part miss-detection. To address these radar-specific artifacts, we propose mmPred, the first diffusion-based framework tailored for radar-based HMP. mmPred introduces a dual-domain historical motion representation to guide the generation process, combining a Time-domain Pose Refinement (TPR) branch for learning fine-grained details and a Frequency-domain Dominant Motion (FDM) branch for capturing global motion trends and suppressing frame-level inconsistency. Furthermore, we design a Global Skeleton-relational Transformer (GST) as the diffusion backbone to model global inter-joint cooperation, enabling corrupted joints to dynamically aggregate information from others. Extensive experiments show that mmPred achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 8.6% on mmBody and 22% on mm-Fi.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6mmPred\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u57df\u5386\u53f2\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u9aa8\u67b6\u5173\u7cfbTransformer\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eRGB-D\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7684HMP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u6d88\u9632\u3001\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b58\u5728\u955c\u9762\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u591a\u5f84\u6548\u5e94\u7b49\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fammPred\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u53cc\u57df\u5386\u53f2\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u65f6\u57df\u59ff\u6001\u7ec6\u5316\u5206\u652f\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u9891\u57df\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u652f\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d8b\u52bf\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u5e27\u7ea7\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b2) \u5168\u5c40\u9aa8\u67b6\u5173\u7cfbTransformer\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u5168\u5c40\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728mmBody\u548cmm-Fi\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53478.6%\u548c22%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u5f15\u5165HMP\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684mmPred\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u96f7\u8fbe\u7279\u5b9a\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u548c\u6076\u52a3\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Current evaluations mostly report global rates such as false rejection or compliance. These scores treat each prompt alone and miss local inconsistency, where a model accepts one phrasing of an intent but rejects a close paraphrase. This gap limits diagnosis and tuning. We introduce \"semantic confusion,\" a failure mode that captures such local inconsistency, and a framework to measure it. We build ParaGuard, a 10k-prompt corpus of controlled paraphrase clusters that hold intent fixed while varying surface form. We then propose three model-agnostic metrics at the token level: Confusion Index, Confusion Rate, and Confusion Depth. These metrics compare each refusal to its nearest accepted neighbors and use token embeddings, next-token probabilities, and perplexity signals. Experiments across diverse model families and deployment guards show that global false-rejection rate hides critical structure. Our metrics reveal globally unstable boundaries in some settings, localized pockets of inconsistency in others, and cases where stricter refusal does not increase inconsistency. We also show how confusion-aware auditing separates how often a system refuses from how sensibly it refuses. This gives developers a practical signal to reduce false refusals while preserving safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u8bed\u4e49\u6df7\u6dc6\"\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62d2\u7edd\u65e0\u5bb3\u8bf7\u6c42\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86ParaGuard\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6307\u6807\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u9519\u8bef\u62d2\u7edd\u65e0\u5bb3\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5168\u5c40\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u6216\u5408\u89c4\u7387\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u2014\u2014\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u53d7\u67d0\u79cd\u610f\u56fe\u8868\u8fbe\u5374\u62d2\u7edd\u5176\u8fd1\u4e49\u8868\u8fbe\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5dee\u8ddd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\"\u8bed\u4e49\u6df7\u6dc6\"\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2. \u6784\u5efaParaGuard\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b10k\u4e2a\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u91ca\u4e49\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u610f\u56fe\u4e0d\u53d8\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684token\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u6df7\u6dc6\u6307\u6570\u3001\u6df7\u6dc6\u7387\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u6bcf\u4e2a\u62d2\u7edd\u4e0e\u5176\u6700\u8fd1\u63a5\u53d7\u90bb\u5c45\uff0c\u5229\u7528token\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u4e0b\u4e00token\u6982\u7387\u548c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5168\u5c40\u9519\u8bef\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a1. \u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b2. \u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff1b3. \u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u5e76\u4e0d\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u6df7\u6dc6\u611f\u77e5\u5ba1\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u9891\u7387\u548c\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u8bef\u62d2\u7edd\u3002\u6df7\u6dc6\u6307\u6807\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u8c03\u4f18\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, many existing HMP methods either produce a single, deterministic forecast that ignores uncertainty or rely on probabilistic models that sacrifice kinematic plausibility. Diffusion models improve the accuracy-diversity trade-off but often depend on multi-stage pipelines that are costly for edge deployment. This work focuses on how to ensure spatial-temporal coherence within a single-stage diffusion model for HMP. We introduce SMamDiff, a Spatial Mamba-based Diffusion model with two novel designs: (i) a residual-DCT motion encoding that subtracts the last observed pose before a temporal DCT, reducing the first DC component ($f=0$) dominance and highlighting informative higher-frequency cues so the model learns how joints move rather than where they are; and (ii) a stickman-drawing spatial-mamba module that processes joints in an ordered, joint-by-joint manner, making later joints condition on earlier ones to induce long-range, cross-joint dependencies. On Human3.6M and HumanEva, these coherence mechanisms deliver state-of-the-art results among single-stage probabilistic HMP methods while using less latency and memory than multi-stage diffusion baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "SMamDiff\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4Mamba\u7684\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5deeDCT\u8fd0\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u9aa8\u67b6\u7ed8\u5236\u7a7a\u95f4Mamba\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u727a\u7272\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6539\u5584\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6743\u8861\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u4fdd\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSMamDiff\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1\uff09\u6b8b\u5deeDCT\u8fd0\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\uff1a\u51cf\u53bb\u6700\u540e\u89c2\u5bdf\u59ff\u6001\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u57dfDCT\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11DC\u5206\u91cf\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5173\u8282\u5982\u4f55\u8fd0\u52a8\u800c\u975e\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1b2\uff09\u9aa8\u67b6\u7ed8\u5236\u7a7a\u95f4Mamba\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u6309\u987a\u5e8f\u9010\u5173\u8282\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u540e\u7eed\u5173\u8282\u4f9d\u8d56\u5148\u524d\u5173\u8282\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u957f\u7a0b\u8de8\u5173\u8282\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728Human3.6M\u548cHumanEva\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u6982\u7387HMP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6bd4\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5deeDCT\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u9aa8\u67b6\u7ed8\u5236\u7a7a\u95f4Mamba\u6a21\u5757\uff0cSMamDiff\u5728\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches that rely on attention-based or deformable convolution fusion blocks still struggle to balance performance and lightweight design. Beyond fusion complexity, extracting modality features with shared backbones yields suboptimal representations due to insufficient modality-specific modeling, whereas dual-stream architectures nearly double the parameter count, ultimately limiting practical deployment. To this end, we propose MM-DETR, a lightweight and efficient framework for multimodal object detection. Specifically, we propose a Mamba-based dual granularity fusion encoder that reformulates global interaction as channel-wise dynamic gating and leverages a 1D selective scan for efficient cross-modal modeling with linear complexity. Following this design, we further reinterpret multimodal fusion as a modality completion problem. A region-aware 2D selective scanning completion branch is introduced to recover modality-specific cues, supporting fine-grained fusion along a bidirectional pyramid pathway with minimal overhead. To further reduce parameter redundancy while retaining strong feature extraction capability, a lightweight frequency-aware modality adapter is inserted into the shared backbone.

Yet existing benchmarks lack the transparency and auditability needed to assess whether agents behave reliably. We present DrawingBench, a verification framework for evaluating the trustworthiness of agentic LLMs through spatial reasoning tasks that require generating sequences of low-level GUI actions. Unlike opaque evaluations, DrawingBench provides transparent, rule-based assessment: 8 objective criteria enable reproducible scoring, while action-level inspection allows stakeholders to audit agent behavior. Our framework comprises 250 diverse prompts across 20 categories and 4 difficulty levels, deterministic evaluation metrics, and an external oversight mechanism through multi-turn feedback that enables human control over agent refinement. Evaluating four state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude-4 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Gemini-2.5 Flash) across 1,000 tests, we establish both capabilities and limitations: models achieved 92.8% perfect performance with structured external feedback driving significant improvements (average +3.2%, up to +32.8% for complex scenes), but systematic error patterns emerged in tool state management and long-horizon planning. Notably, specification clarity proved more important than task complexity -- models achieved 100% perfect performance when given explicit, verifiable criteria. These findings demonstrate that transparent evaluation frameworks can establish trust in agentic systems, with external oversight proving more reliable than self-correction for guiding agent behavior. Our open-source framework provides a template for trustworthy agent assessment.

It is capable of partitioning data samples into distinct groups by learning a consensus representation. However, a significant challenge remains: the problem of untrustworthy fusion. This problem primarily arises from two key factors: 1) Existing methods often ignore the presence of inherent noise within individual views; 2) In traditional MVC methods using Contrastive Learning (CL), similarity computations typically rely on different views of the same instance, while neglecting the structural information from nearest neighbors within the same cluster. Consequently, this leads to the wrong direction for multi-view fusion. To address this problem, we present a novel Trusted Hierarchical Contrastive Representation Learning (THCRL). It consists of two key modules. Specifically, we propose the Deep Symmetry Hierarchical Fusion (DSHF) module, which leverages the UNet architecture integrated with multiple denoising mechanisms to achieve trustworthy fusion of multi-view data. Furthermore, we present the Average K-Nearest Neighbors Contrastive Learning (AKCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. Unlike conventional strategies, AKCL enhances representation similarity among samples belonging to the same cluster, rather than merely focusing on the same sample across views, thereby reinforcing the confidence of the fused representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that THCRL achieves the state-of-the-art performance in deep MVC tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTHCRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u878d\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5bf9\u79f0\u5c42\u6b21\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5e73\u5747K\u8fd1\u90bb\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u9762\u4e34\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u878d\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a1)\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u5355\u89c6\u56fe\u5185\u56fa\u6709\u566a\u58f0\uff1b2)\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u540c\u4e00\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u540c\u4e00\u7c07\u5185\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u5411\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u4fe1\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60(THCRL)\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1)\u6df1\u5ea6\u5bf9\u79f0\u5c42\u6b21\u878d\u5408(DSHF)\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528UNet\u67b6\u6784\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u91cd\u53bb\u566a\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\uff1b2)\u5e73\u5747K\u8fd1\u90bb\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60(AKCL)\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u878d\u5408\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u540c\u4e00\u7c07\u5185\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTHCRL\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "THCRL\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u878d\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u566a\u878d\u5408\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c07\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We revisit its mechanism and reveal a critical, overlooked factor in reconstruction degradation: the approximate noise error. This error stems from approximating the noise at step t with the prediction at step t-1, resulting in severe error accumulation throughout the inversion process. We introduce Projection-Orthogonal Least Squares for Robust and Adaptive Inversion (POLARIS), which reformulates inversion from an error-compensation problem into an error-origin problem.

We assessed two widely deployed clinical AI systems (OpenEvidence and UpToDate Expert AI) against three state-of-the-art generalist LLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) using a 1,000-item mini-benchmark combining MedQA (medical knowledge) and HealthBench (clinician-alignment) tasks.

Although deep learning-based descriptors have demonstrated superior performance to traditional hand-crafted descriptors in many applications, the scarcity of pore-scale image patch datasets has hindered their further development in the facial domain. In this paper, we propose the PorePatch dataset, a high-quality pore-scale image patch dataset, and establish a rational evaluation benchmark. We introduce a Data-Model Co-Evolution (DMCE) framework to generate a progressively refined, high-quality dataset from high-resolution facial images. We then train existing SOTA models on our dataset and conduct extensive experiments. Our results show that the SOTA model achieves a FPR95 value of 1.91% on the matching task, outperforming PSIFT (22.41%) by a margin of 20.5%. However, its advantage is diminished in the 3D reconstruction task, where its overall performance is not significantly better than that of traditional descriptors. This indicates that deep learning descriptors still have limitations in addressing the challenges of facial weak-texture regions, and much work remains to be done in this field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PorePatch\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cDMCE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u9762\u90e8\u5f31\u7eb9\u7406\u533a\u57df\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u5728\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u4f46\u57283D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u4f18\u52bf\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u90e8\u76ae\u80a4\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5f31\u7eb9\u7406\u7279\u6027\u7ed9\u5c40\u90e8\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u5339\u914d\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6bdb\u5b54\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u8865\u4e01\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPorePatch\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6bdb\u5b54\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u8865\u4e01\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e-\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316(DMCE)\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9762\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6e10\u8fdb\u7cbe\u70bc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "SOTA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52301.91%\u7684FPR95\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8ePSIFT\u768422.41%\uff0c\u4f46\u57283D\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u5f31\u7eb9\u7406\u533a\u57df\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, existing English translations largely rely on literal rendering, making it difficult for target-language readers to reconstruct the underlying conceptual networks and apply them in clinical practice. This study adopted a human-in-the-loop (HITL) framework and selected four passages from the medical canon Huangdi Neijing that are fundamental in theory. Through prompt-based cognitive scaffolding, DeepSeek V3.1 was guided to identify metaphor and metonymy in the source text and convey the theory in translation. In the evaluation stage, ChatGPT 5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro were instructed by prompts to simulate three types of real-world readers. Human translations, baseline model translations, and prompt-adjusted translations were scored by the simulated readers across five cognitive dimensions, followed by structured interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results show that the prompt-adjusted LLM translations perform best across all five dimensions, with high cross-model and cross-role consistency. The interview themes reveal differences between human and machine translation, effective strategies for metaphor and metonymy transfer, and readers' cognitive preferences.

Yet, existing benchmarks provide too narrow a scope for evaluation, failing to holistically assess these advanced abilities. To address this, we introduce WiseEdit, a knowledge-intensive benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of cognition- and creativity-informed image editing, featuring deep task depth and broad knowledge breadth. Drawing an analogy to human cognitive creation, WiseEdit decomposes image editing into three cascaded steps, i.e., Awareness, Interpretation, and Imagination, each corresponding to a task that poses a challenge for models to complete at the specific step. It also encompasses complex tasks, where none of the three steps can be finished easily. Furthermore, WiseEdit incorporates three fundamental types of knowledge: Declarative, Procedural, and Metacognitive knowledge.

Prevailing paradigms are forced into a compromise. Embedding prediction methods introduce a conflicting pixel-level objective that degrades the MLLM's general dialogue abilities. The alternative, next-token prediction, reframes segmentation as an autoregressive task, which preserves dialogue but forces a trade-off between poor segmentation performance with sparse outputs or prohibitive inference speeds with rich ones. We resolve this trilemma with all-mask prediction, a novel paradigm that decouples autoregressive dialogue generation from non-autoregressive mask prediction. We present STAMP: Simultaneous Textual All-Mask Prediction, an MLLM that embodies this paradigm. After generating a textual response, STAMP predicts an entire segmentation mask in a single forward pass by treating it as a parallel \"fill-in-the-blank\" task over image patches. This design maintains the MLLM's dialogue ability by avoiding conflicting objectives, enables high segmentation performance by leveraging rich, bidirectional spatial context for all mask tokens, and achieves exceptional speed.

However, existing systems face two limitations: (1) reliance on situation-centric datasets lacking persistent user identity, which hampers the capture of personalized affective nuances; and (2) dependence on opaque, coarse reward signals that hinder development of verifiable empathetic reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce KardiaBench, a large-scale user-grounded benchmark comprising 178,080 QA pairs across 22,080 multi-turn conversations anchored to 671 real-world profiles. The dataset is constructed via a model-in-the-loop pipeline with iterative rubric-guided refinement to ensure psychological plausibility and persona consistency. This progressive empathy pipeline that integrates user comprehension, contextual reasoning, and emotion perception into conversations, followed by iterative critique and rubric-based refinement to ensure psychological plausibility, emotional fidelity, and persona consistency. Building on this, we propose Kardia-R1, a framework that trains models for interpretable, stepwise empathetic cognition. Kardia-R1 leverages Rubric-as-Judge Empathetic Reinforcement Learning (Rubric-ERL), a GRPO-based method that uses explainable, human-aligned rubric rewards to tightly couple user understanding, emotional inference, and supportive response generation. Extensive experiments across four LLM backbones demonstrate that Kardia-R1 consistently outperforms othet methods in emotion accuracy, empathy, relevance, persona consistency, and safety.

However, most previous studies primarily focus on 2D artistic fonts in flat design, leaving personalized 3D-AFG largely underexplored. 3D-AFG not only enables applications in immersive 3D environments such as video games and animations, but also may enhance 2D-AFG by rendering 2D fonts of novel views. Moreover, unlike general 3D objects, 3D fonts exhibit precise semantics with strong structural constraints and also demand fine-grained part-level style control. To address these challenges, we propose SplatFont3D, a novel structure-aware text-to-3D AFG framework with 3D Gaussian splatting, which enables the creation of 3D artistic fonts from diverse style text prompts with precise part-level style control. Specifically, we first introduce a Glyph2Cloud module, which progressively enhances both the shapes and styles of 2D glyphs (or components) and produces their corresponding 3D point clouds for Gaussian initialization. The initialized 3D Gaussians are further optimized through interaction with a pretrained 2D diffusion model using score distillation sampling. To enable part-level control, we present a dynamic component assignment strategy that exploits the geometric priors of 3D Gaussians to partition components, while alleviating drift-induced entanglement during 3D Gaussian optimization. Our SplatFont3D provides more explicit and effective part-level style control than NeRF, attaining faster rendering efficiency. Experiments show that our SplatFont3D outperforms existing 3D models for 3D-AFG in style-text consistency, visual quality, and rendering efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "SplatFont3D\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u6587\u672c\u52303D\u827a\u672f\u5b57\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u90e8\u4ef6\u7ea7\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u827a\u672f\u5b57\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce82D\u5e73\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e2a\u6027\u53163D\u827a\u672f\u5b57\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u30023D\u5b57\u4f53\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u3001\u52a8\u753b\u7b49\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f3D\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6e32\u67d3\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u589e\u5f3a2D\u5b57\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u30023D\u5b57\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u5f3a\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u90e8\u4ef6\u7ea7\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSplatFont3D\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) Glyph2Cloud\u6a21\u5757\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a2D\u5b57\u5f62\uff08\u90e8\u4ef6\uff09\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u5e943D\u70b9\u4e91\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6570\u84b8\u998f\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec32D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f18\u53163D\u9ad8\u65af\uff1b3) \u52a8\u6001\u90e8\u4ef6\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u5229\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u90e8\u4ef6\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "result": "SplatFont3D\u5728\u98ce\u683c-\u6587\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u67093D\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4NeRF\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u660e\u786e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u90e8\u4ef6\u7ea7\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "SplatFont3D\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u827a\u672f\u5b57\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u591a\u6837\u5316\u98ce\u683c\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u62103D\u827a\u672f\u5b57\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u90e8\u4ef6\u7ea7\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u5b57\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

For certain classes of shapes that have undergone an engineering design process, the realism of the shape is tightly coupled with the underlying physical properties, e.g., aerodynamic efficiency for automobiles. Since existing methods lack knowledge of such physics, they are unable to use this knowledge to enhance the realism of shape generation. Motivated by this, we propose a unified physics-based 3D shape generation pipeline, with a focus on industrial design applications. Specifically, we introduce a new flow matching model with explicit physical guidance, consisting of an alternating update process. We iteratively perform a velocity-based update and a physics-based refinement, progressively adjusting the latent code to align with the desired 3D shapes and physical properties. We further strengthen physical validity by incorporating a physics-aware regularization term into the velocity-based update step. To support such physics-guided updates, we build a shape-and-physics variational autoencoder (SP-VAE) that jointly encodes shape and physics information into a unified latent space.

Under review for a suitable AI conference", "summary": "Understanding sentiment in complex textual expressions remains a fundamental challenge in affective computing. To address this, we propose a Dynamic Fusion Learning Model (DyFuLM), a multimodal framework designed to capture both hierarchical semantic representations and fine-grained emotional nuances. DyFuLM introduces two key moodules: a Hierarchical Dynamic Fusion module that adaptively integrates multi-level features, and a Gated Feature Aggregation module that regulates cross-layer information ffow to achieve balanced representation learning. Comprehensive experiments on multi-task sentiment datasets demonstrate that DyFuLM achieves 82.64% coarse-grained and 68.48% fine-grained accuracy, yielding the lowest regression errors (MAE = 0.0674, MSE = 0.0082) and the highest R^2 coefficient of determination (R^2= 0.6903). Furthermore, the ablation study validates the effectiveness of each module in DyFuLM. When all modules are removed, the accuracy drops by 0.91% for coarse-grained and 0.68% for fine-grained tasks.

In practice, systems access LLMs via commercial APIs or open-source deployments, and the model landscape (e.g., GPT, Claude, Llama) evolves rapidly. This rapid evolution forces frequent model switches driven by capability, cost, deployment constraints, and privacy. Yet prompts are highly model-sensitive: reusing a prompt engineered for one model on another often yields substantially worse performance than a prompt optimized for the target model. We term this phenomenon Model Drifting. Through extensive empirical analysis across diverse LLM configurations, we show that model drifting is both common and severe. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptBridge, a training-free framework that preserves prompt effectiveness under model switches, enabling cross-model prompt transfer without costly per-task or per-model re-optimization. PromptBridge requires only a small set of alignment tasks for calibration. It first applies Model-Adaptive Reflective Prompt Evolution (MAP-RPE) to obtain task- and model-specific optimal prompts via iterative reflective refinement and quantitative evaluation. Using the resulting calibrated prompt pairs for the source and target models, PromptBridge learns a cross-model prompt mapping. At test time, i.e., for an unseen task, given a source-model prompt, this mapping directly produces an optimized prompt for the target model. Experiments in single-agent and multi-agent settings show that PromptBridge consistently improves downstream accuracy while reducing migration effort. The code will be available soon.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faPromptBridge\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u5728\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u95f4\u8fc1\u79fb\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u6f02\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u65b0\u4f18\u5316\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6210\u672c\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u9650\u5236\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u9891\u7e41\u5207\u6362\u4e0d\u540c\u7684LLM\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f46\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\"\u6a21\u578b\u6f02\u79fb\"\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6bcf\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPromptBridge\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cd\u5c04\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u5316\uff08MAP-RPE\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u53cd\u5c04\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u83b7\u5f97\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63d0\u793a\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u6620\u5c04\uff1b3\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\uff0c\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPromptBridge\u5728\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u90fd\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc1\u79fb\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u5c11\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6bcf\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u6bcf\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u6f02\u79fb\u662fLLM\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u4e14\u4e25\u91cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0cPromptBridge\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

We propose $\\texttt{NewtonRewards}$, the first physics-grounded post-training framework for video generation based on $\\textit{verifiable rewards}$. Instead of relying on human or VLM feedback, $\\texttt{NewtonRewards}$ extracts $\\textit{measurable proxies}$ from generated videos using frozen utility models: optical flow serves as a proxy for velocity, while high-level appearance features serve as a proxy for mass. These proxies enable explicit enforcement of Newtonian structure through two complementary rewards: a Newtonian kinematic constraint enforcing constant-acceleration dynamics, and a mass conservation reward preventing trivial, degenerate solutions. We evaluate $\\texttt{NewtonRewards}$ on five Newtonian Motion Primitives (free fall, horizontal/parabolic throw, and ramp sliding down/up) using our newly constructed large-scale benchmark, $\\texttt{NewtonBench-60K}$. Across all primitives in visual and physics metrics, $\\texttt{NewtonRewards}$ consistently improves physical plausibility, motion smoothness, and temporal coherence over prior post-training methods. It further maintains strong performance under out-of-distribution shifts in height, speed, and friction.

Our approach adapts a compact Conformer to raw 306-channel MEG signals, with a lightweight convolutional projection layer and task-specific heads. For Speech Detection, a MEG-oriented SpecAugment provided a first exploration of MEG-specific augmentation. For Phoneme Classification, we used inverse-square-root class weighting and a dynamic grouping loader to handle 100-sample averaged examples. In addition, a simple instance-level normalization proved critical to mitigate distribution shifts on the holdout split. Using the official Standard track splits and F1-macro for model selection, our best systems achieved 88.9% (Speech) and 65.8% (Phoneme) on the leaderboard, surpassing the competition baselines and ranking within the top-10 in both tasks.

However, applying this powerful methodology to the next-token prediction (NTP) paradigm remains challenging. The primary obstacle is the low correlation between the reward of an image decoded from an intermediate token sequence and the reward of the fully generated image. Consequently, these incomplete intermediate representations prove to be poor indicators for guiding the pruning direction, a limitation that stems from their inherent incompleteness in scale or semantic content. To effectively address this critical issue, we introduce the Filling-Based Reward (FR). This novel design estimates the approximate future trajectory of an intermediate sample by finding and applying a reasonable filling scheme to complete the sequence. Both the correlation coefficient between rewards of intermediate samples and final samples, as well as multiple intrinsic signals like token confidence, indicate that the FR provides an excellent and reliable metric for accurately evaluating the quality of intermediate samples. Building upon this foundation, we propose FR-TTS, a sophisticated scaling strategy. FR-TTS efficiently searches for good filling schemes and incorporates a diversity reward with a dynamic weighting schedule to achieve a balanced and comprehensive evaluation of intermediate samples. We experimentally validate the superiority of FR-TTS over multiple established benchmarks and various reward models.

We introduce RecruitView, a dataset of 2,011 naturalistic video interview clips from 300+ participants with 27,000 pairwise comparative judgments across 12 dimensions: Big Five personality traits, overall personality score, and six interview performance metrics. To leverage this data, we propose Cross-Modal Regression with Manifold Fusion (CRMF), a geometric deep learning framework that explicitly models behavioral representations across hyperbolic, spherical, and Euclidean manifolds. CRMF employs geometry-specific expert networks to capture hierarchical trait structures, directional behavioral patterns, and continuous performance variations simultaneously. An adaptive routing mechanism dynamically weights expert contributions based on input characteristics. Through principled tangent space fusion, CRMF achieves superior performance while training 40-50% fewer trainable parameters than large multimodal models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRMF substantially outperforms the selected baselines, achieving up to 11.4% improvement in Spearman correlation and 6.0% in concordance index.

However, current research is constrained by two key challenges: language coverage and efficiency. Most of the popular S2TT datasets are substantially English-centric, which restricts the scaling-up of MLLMs' many-to-many translation capabilities. Moreover, the inference speed of MLLMs degrades dramatically when the speech is converted into long sequences (e.g., 750 tokens). To address these limitations, we propose a Multilingual Cost-effective Accelerated Speech-to-Text Translator (MCAT) framework, which includes two innovations. First, a language scaling method that leverages curriculum learning and a data balancing strategy is introduced to extend the language coverage supported by MLLMs to 70 languages and achieve mutual translation among these languages. Second, an optimized speech adapter module is designed to reduce the length of the speech sequence to only 30 tokens. Extensive experiments were conducted on MLLMs of different scales (9B and 27B). The experimental results demonstrate that MCAT not only surpasses state-of-the-art end-to-end models on the FLEURS dataset across 70x69 directions but also enhances batch inference efficiency. This is achieved with only ~100M trainable parameters and by using only 10 hours of S2TT data per language. Furthermore, we have released MCAT as open-source to promote the development of MLLMs for robust S2TT capabilities.

Although Action Units (AUs) have long served as the foundation of affective computing, existing approaches rarely address how to infer psychologically plausible causal relations between AUs and expressions directly from data. We propose CausalAffect, the first framework for causal graph discovery in facial affect analysis. CausalAffect models AU-AU and AU-Expression dependencies through a two-level polarity and direction aware causal hierarchy that integrates population-level regularities with sample-adaptive structures. A feature-level counterfactual intervention mechanism further enforces true causal effects while suppressing spurious correlations. Crucially, our approach requires neither jointly annotated datasets nor handcrafted causal priors, yet it recovers causal structures consistent with established psychological theories while revealing novel inhibitory and previously uncharacterized dependencies. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that CausalAffect advances the state of the art in both AU detection and expression recognition, establishing a principled connection between causal discovery and interpretable facial behavior.

We evaluate their performance on Yoruba, Kinyarwanda, and Amharic. While these languages are spoken by millions, their online usage on conversational platforms is often sparse, heavily influenced by English, and not representative of the authentic, monolingual conversations prevalent among native speakers. This lack of readily available authentic data online creates a challenge of scarcity of conversational data for training language models. To investigate this, data was collected from subreddits and local news sources for each language. The analysis showed a stark contrast between the two sources. Reddit data was minimal and characterized by heavy code-switching. Conversely, local news media offered a robust source of clean, monolingual language data, which also prompted more user engagement in the local language on the news publishers social media pages.

Even on simple T2I tasks, they tend to produce \" fake\" images with distinct AI artifacts, often characterized by \"overly smooth skin\" and \"oily facial sheens\". To recapture the original goal of \"indistinguishable-from-reality\" generation, we propose RealGen, a photorealistic text-to-image framework. RealGen integrates an LLM component for prompt optimization and a diffusion model for realistic image generation. Inspired by adversarial generation, RealGen introduces a \"Detector Reward\" mechanism, which quantifies artifacts and assesses realism using both semantic-level and feature-level synthetic image detectors. We leverage this reward signal with the GRPO algorithm to optimize the entire generation pipeline, significantly enhancing image realism and detail. Furthermore, we propose RealBench, an automated evaluation benchmark employing Detector-Scoring and Arena-Scoring. It enables human-free photorealism assessment, yielding results that are more accurate and aligned with real user experience. Experiments demonstrate that RealGen significantly outperforms general models like GPT-Image-1 and Qwen-Image, as well as specialized photorealistic models like FLUX-Krea, in terms of realism, detail, and aesthetics.

Existing SLU datasets generally lack sufficient diversity and complexity, and there is an absence of a unified benchmark for the latest Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Audio Language Models (LALMs). This work introduces MAC-SLU, a novel Multi-Intent Automotive Cabin Spoken Language Understanding Dataset, which increases the difficulty of the SLU task by incorporating authentic and complex multi-intent data. Based on MAC-SLU, we conducted a comprehensive benchmark of leading open-source LLMs and LALMs, covering methods like in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and end-to-end (E2E) and pipeline paradigms. Our experiments show that while LLMs and LALMs have the potential to complete SLU tasks through in-context learning, their performance still lags significantly behind SFT. Meanwhile, E2E LALMs demonstrate performance comparable to pipeline approaches and effectively avoid error propagation from speech recognition.

This paper proposes a novel method for addressing this task, called Structured Context Learning, which introduces the Structured Partition of Sequence (SPoS) to provide a structured context for learning temporal information. Our approach is end-to-end trainable and flexible, not restricted to specific temporal models like GRU, LSTM, and Transformers. This flexibility enables our method to achieve a better speed-accuracy trade-off. Specifically, we apply SPoS to partition the input frame sequence and provide a structured context for the subsequent temporal model. Notably, SPoS's overall computational complexity is linear with respect to the video length.

Current models often struggle to distinguish objective unsolvability (inherent contradictions in the problem) from subjective capability limitations (problems beyond the model's competence), which leads to hallucinations and overconfidence. To address this, we propose UnsolvableQA and UnsolvableRL to solve feasible problems, detect inherent contradictions, and prudently refuse tasks beyond capability. Specifically, we construct UnsolvableQA, a dataset of paired solvable and unsolvable instances derived via a dual-track methodology: programmatic generation for logic puzzles and a novel \"Reverse Construction\" method that injects contradictions into valid reasoning chains for mathematics. Building on this dataset, we introduce UnsolvableRL, a reinforcement learning framework with three reward components jointly accounting for accuracy, unsolvability, and difficulty. Empirical results show that our approach achieves near-perfect unsolvability detection while also improving accuracy on solvable tasks. Crucially, we identify Capability Collapse, demonstrating that explicit exposure to unsolvable data is indispensable for preventing models from becoming systematically overconfident.

Human communication, however, relies on multiple forms of memory, from recalling past conversations to adapting to personal traits and situational context. This paper introduces the Mixed Memory-Augmented Generation (MMAG) pattern, a framework that organizes memory for LLM-based agents into five interacting layers: conversational, long-term user, episodic and event-linked, sensory and context-aware, and short-term working memory. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, we map these layers to technical components and outline strategies for coordination, prioritization, and conflict resolution.

Early approaches struggle to generalize due to reliance on specialized models trained on curated small datasets. While recent advancements in large-scale 3D foundation models have significantly enhanced instance-level generation, coherent scene generation remains a challenge, where performance is limited by inaccurate per-object pose estimations and spatial inconsistency. To this end, this paper introduces CC-FMO, a zero-shot, camera-conditioned pipeline for single-image to 3D scene generation that jointly conforms to the object layout in input image and preserves instance fidelity. CC-FMO employs a hybrid instance generator that combines semantics-aware vector-set representation with detail-rich structured latent representation, yielding object geometries that are both semantically plausible and high-quality. Furthermore, CC-FMO enables the application of foundational pose estimation models in the scene generation task via a simple yet effective camera-conditioned scale-solving algorithm, to enforce scene-level coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CC-FMO consistently generates high-fidelity camera-aligned compositional scenes, outperforming all state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "CC-FMO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u52303D\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u5b9e\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u52303D\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u65e9\u671f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff1b2\uff09\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u751f\u6210\u6709\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u751f\u6210\u4ecd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "CC-FMO\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u5b9e\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u96c6\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u673a\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u7840\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCC-FMO\u80fd\u591f\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "CC-FMO\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u52303D\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e2\u7b26\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e03\u5c40\u53c8\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3aAR/VR\u548c\u5177\u8eabAI\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this problem, we explore a smartphone-based structured-light system that projects a grid pattern onto the ground and reconstructs local terrain unevenness from a single handheld device. The system is inspired by face-recognition projectors, but adapted for ground sensing. A key technical challenge is robustly matching the projected grid with its deformed observation under perspective distortion and partial occlusion. Conventional one-dimensional dynamic time warping (1D-DTW) is not directly applicable to such two-dimensional grid patterns. We therefore propose a topology-constrained two-dimensional dynamic time warping (2D-DTW) algorithm that performs column-wise alignment under a global grid consistency constraint. The proposed method is designed to be simple enough to run on resource limited platforms while preserving the grid structure required for accurate triangulation. We demonstrate that our 2D-DTW formulation can be used not only for terrain sensing but also as a general tool for matching structured grid patterns in image processing scenarios.

Experiments show that the conventional short chain-of-thought (Short-CoT) prompting paradigm exhibits pronounced overconfidence, whereas the emerging long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) approach mitigates it through iterative exploration and self-reflection. We further characterise observable behaviours and influential factors. To probe the underlying cause, we propose the \\textbf{cognitive-rigidity hypothesis}, which posits that overconfidence arises when the reasoning process prematurely converges on a narrow set of thought paths.

While existing video diffusion models require large domain-specific datasets and struggle to generalize, recent image generation models trained on language-image corpora exhibit strong compositionality, including the ability to synthesize temporally coherent grid images. This suggests a latent capacity for video-like generation even without explicit temporal modeling.\n  We explore whether such models can serve as visual planners for robots when lightly adapted using LoRA finetuning. We propose a two-part framework that includes: (1) text-conditioned generation, which uses a language instruction and the first frame, and (2) trajectory-conditioned generation, which uses a 2D trajectory overlay and the same initial frame. Experiments on the Jaco Play dataset, Bridge V2, and the RT1 dataset show that both modes produce smooth, coherent robot videos aligned with their respective conditions.\n  Our findings indicate that pretrained image generators encode transferable temporal priors and can function as video-like robotic planners under minimal supervision.

While the former has been extensively studied, omission-based deception remains largely overlooked, even though it can subtly guide readers toward false conclusions under the illusion of completeness. To pioneer in this direction, this paper presents OmiGraph, the first omission-aware framework for misinformation detection. Specifically, OmiGraph constructs an omission-aware graph for the target news by utilizing a contextual environment that captures complementary perspectives of the same event, thereby surfacing potentially omitted contents. Based on this graph, omission-oriented relation modeling is then proposed to identify the internal contextual dependencies, as well as the dynamic omission intents, formulating a comprehensive omission relation representation. Finally, to extract omission patterns for detection, OmiGraph introduces omission-aware message-passing and aggregation that establishes holistic deception perception by integrating the omission contents and relations. Experiments show that, by considering the omission perspective, our approach attains remarkable performance, achieving average improvements of +5.4% F1 and +5.3% ACC on two large-scale benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmiGraph\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u578b\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7f3a\u5931\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u88ab\u7701\u7565\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347", "motivation": "\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5305\u62ec\u660e\u786e\u7f16\u9020\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u8fd8\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u8fc7\u7701\u7565\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u8bef\u5bfc\u8bfb\u8005\u7684\"\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u578b\"\u6b3a\u9a97\u3002\u540e\u8005\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5fae\u5999\u5730\u5f15\u5bfc\u8bfb\u8005\u5f97\u51fa\u9519\u8bef\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4e00\u76f4\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002", "method": "OmiGraph\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u6784\u5efa\u7f3a\u5931\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u540c\u4e00\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u89c6\u89d2\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u7f3a\u5931\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5185\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u610f\u56fe\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u7f3a\u5931\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u548c\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u7f3a\u5931\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cOmiGraph\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347F1\u5206\u65705.4%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u73875.3%\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u8003\u8651\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u662f\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0cOmiGraph\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u7f3a\u5931\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Updating 3D scenes from sparse-view observations is crucial for various real-world applications, including urban planning, disaster assessment, and historical site preservation, where dense scans are often unavailable or impractical. In this paper, we propose Cross-Temporal 3D Gaussian Splatting (Cross-Temporal 3DGS), a novel framework for efficiently reconstructing and updating 3D scenes across different time periods, using sparse images and previously captured scene priors. Our approach comprises three stages: 1) Cross-temporal camera alignment for estimating and aligning camera poses across different timestamps; 2) Interference-based confidence initialization to identify unchanged regions between timestamps, thereby guiding updates; and 3) Progressive cross-temporal optimization, which iteratively integrates historical prior information into the 3D scene to enhance reconstruction quality. Our method supports non-continuous capture, enabling not only updates using new sparse views to refine existing scenes, but also recovering past scenes from limited data with the help of current captures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of this approach to achieve temporal changes using only sparse images, which can later be reconstructed into detailed 3D representations as needed. Experimental results show significant improvements over baseline methods in reconstruction quality and data efficiency, making this approach a promising solution for scene versioning, cross-temporal digital twins, and long-term spatial documentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCross-Temporal 3DGS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u573a\u666f\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u6bb5\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff08\u5982\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u707e\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u9057\u5740\u4fdd\u62a4\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u53d6\u5bc6\u96c6\u626b\u63cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u66f4\u65b03D\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u673a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e76\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u95f4\u672a\u53d8\u5316\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b3) \u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6574\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u975e\u8fde\u7eed\u91c7\u96c6\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u7528\u65b0\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u66f4\u65b0\u73b0\u6709\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u501f\u52a9\u5f53\u524d\u6355\u83b7\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u6062\u590d\u8fc7\u53bb\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u573a\u666f\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7a7a\u95f4\u6587\u6863\u8bb0\u5f55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u50cf\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u53ef\u6309\u9700\u91cd\u5efa\u4e3a\u8be6\u7ec63D\u8868\u793a\u3002"}}

However, generalization has become a key challenge and open problem: existing approaches struggle to adapt to emerging generative methods and content types in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Scene-Aware and Importance-Guided Dynamic Optimization detection framework with continual learning (SAIDO). Specifically, we design Scene-Awareness-Based Expert Module (SAEM) that dynamically identifies and incorporates new scenes using VLLMs. For each scene, independent expert modules are dynamically allocated, enabling the framework to capture scene-specific forgery features better and enhance cross-scene generalization. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting when learning from multiple image generative methods, we introduce Importance-Guided Dynamic Optimization Mechanism (IDOM), which optimizes each neuron through an importance-guided gradient projection strategy, thereby achieving an effective balance between model plasticity and stability. Extensive experiments on continual learning tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms the current SOTA method in both stability and plasticity, achieving 44.22\\% and 40.57\\% relative reductions in average detection error rate and forgetting rate, respectively. On open-world datasets, it improves the average detection accuracy by 9.47\\% compared to the current SOTA method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSAIDO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6ee5\u7528\u5f15\u53d1\u5b89\u5168\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u5174\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u7c7b\u578b\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSAIDO\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u573a\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757(SAEM)\uff0c\u5229\u7528VLLMs\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u5206\u914d\u72ec\u7acb\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\uff1b2) \u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236(IDOM)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f53\u524dSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u7387\u5206\u522b\u76f8\u5bf9\u964d\u4f4e44.22%\u548c40.57%\uff1b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53479.47%\u3002", "conclusion": "SAIDO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, this explicit reasoning process also introduces new safety risks, as unsafe behaviors often emerge within intermediate reasoning trajectories, even when final answers appear harmless. Existing safety alignment approaches primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over safety-oriented long CoT datasets. While intuitive, we find that SFT produces inconsistent safety improvements, degrades reasoning ability, and generalizes poorly across model families. These limitations suggest that purely supervised approaches are insufficient for robust safety alignment in LRMs. To address this, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) as a complementary optimization framework for LRM safety training. Unlike SFT, RL directly optimizes model policies with reward feedback, enabling more adaptive and stable alignment. Extensive experiments across multiple model families and benchmarks show that RL achieves stronger and more consistent safety gains while maintaining reasoning competence. Further analysis of reflection dynamics and token-level entropy reveals that RL suppresses unsafe exploratory reasoning while preserving reflective depth, leading to safer and more reliable reasoning processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u800c\u975e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6291\u5236\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e5f\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u2014\u2014\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\u5f80\u5f80\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u770b\u4f3c\u65e0\u5bb3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8865\u5145\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0cRL\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u53cd\u601d\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u3001\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5bf9\u53cd\u601d\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u71b5\u7684\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0cRL\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u53cd\u601d\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aLRM\u5b89\u5168\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While 3D geometry modeling of such scenes is crucial for applications like AR/VR, gaming, and embodied AI, it remains underexplored due to challenges like diverse motion patterns and frequent occlusions. Beyond novel view rendering, 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has demonstrated remarkable progress in producing detailed, high-quality surface geometry with fast optimization of the underlying structure. However, very few GS-based methods address multihuman, multiobject scenarios, primarily due to the above-mentioned inherent challenges. In a monocular setup, these challenges are further amplified, as maintaining structural consistency under severe occlusion becomes difficult when the scene is optimized solely based on GS-based rendering loss. To tackle the challenges of such a multihuman, multiobject dynamic scene, we propose a hybrid approach that effectively combines the advantages of 1) 3D generative models for generating high-fidelity meshes of the scene elements, 2) Semantic-aware deformation, \\ie rigid transformation of the rigid objects and LBS-based deformation of the humans, and mapping of the deformed high-fidelity meshes in the dynamic scene, and 3) GS-based optimization of the individual elements for further refining their alignments in the scene. Such a hybrid approach helps maintain the object structures even under severe occlusion and can produce multiview and temporally consistent geometry. We choose HOI-M3 for evaluation, as, to the best of our knowledge, this is the only dataset featuring multihuman, multiobject interactions in a dynamic scene.

While hallucination detection has been studied extensively in English, under-resourced Indian languages remain largely unexplored. We present BHRAM-IL, a benchmark for hallucination recognition and assessment in multiple Indian languages, covering Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, along with English. The benchmark comprises 36,047 curated questions across nine categories spanning factual, numerical, reasoning, and linguistic tasks. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs on a benchmark subset of 10,265 questions, analyzing cross-lingual and factual hallucinations across languages, models, scales, categories, and domains using category-specific metrics normalized to (0,1) range. Aggregation over all categories and models yields a primary score of 0.23 and a language-corrected fuzzy score of 0.385, demonstrating the usefulness of BHRAM-IL for hallucination-focused evaluation. The dataset, and the code for generation and evaluation are available on GitHub (https://github.com/sambhashana/BHRAM-IL/) and HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/sambhashana/BHRAM-IL/) to support future research in multilingual hallucination detection and mitigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "BHRAM-IL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u3001\u53e4\u5409\u62c9\u7279\u8bed\u3001\u9a6c\u62c9\u5730\u8bed\u3001\u5965\u91cc\u4e9a\u8bed\u548c\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u5305\u542b36,047\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8614\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u5df2\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86BHRAM-IL\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b36,047\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6db5\u76d69\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3001\u6570\u503c\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u7b49\uff09\u3002\u572810,265\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8614\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u52300-1\u8303\u56f4\uff09\u5206\u6790\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u805a\u5408\u4e3b\u8981\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a0.23\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u6821\u6b63\u6a21\u7cca\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a0.385\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660eBHRAM-IL\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e7b\u89c9\u91cd\u70b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u662f\u6709\u7528\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "BHRAM-IL\u57fa\u51c6\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Prior work has used generative models to replicate known category selectivity in isolated regions (e.g., faces in FFA), but these approaches offer limited insight into how regions interact during complex, naturalistic vision. We introduce NeuroVolve, a generative framework that provides brain-guided image synthesis via optimization of a neural objective function in the embedding space of a pretrained vision-language model. Images are generated under the guidance of a programmable neural objective, i.e., activating or deactivating single regions or multiple regions together. NeuroVolve is validated by recovering known selectivity for individual brain regions, while expanding to synthesize coherent scenes that satisfy complex, multi-region constraints. By tracking optimization steps, it reveals semantic trajectories through embedding space, unifying brain-guided image editing and preferred stimulus generation in a single process. We show that NeuroVolve can generate both low-level and semantic feature-specific stimuli for single ROIs, as well as stimuli aligned to curated neural objectives. These include co-activation and decorrelation between regions, exposing cooperative and antagonistic tuning relationships. Notably, the framework captures subject-specific preferences, supporting personalized brain-driven synthesis and offering interpretable constraints for mapping, analyzing, and probing neural representations of visual information.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuroVolve\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u8111\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u5355\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u8111\u533a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e2a\u8111\u533a\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u9009\u62e9\u6027\uff08\u5982FFA\u4e2d\u7684\u9762\u5b54\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u8111\u533a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u81ea\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u673a\u5236\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u591a\u4e2a\u8111\u533a\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNeuroVolve\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u795e\u7ecf\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u6fc0\u6d3b/\u6291\u5236\u5355\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u8111\u533a\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff1b3\uff09\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b4\uff09\u652f\u6301\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8111\u9a71\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u6210\u529f\u6062\u590d\u5355\u4e2a\u8111\u533a\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u591a\u8111\u533a\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u573a\u666f\uff1b3\uff09\u63ed\u793a\u8111\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u540c\u548c\u62ee\u6297\u8c03\u8c10\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b4\uff09\u6355\u83b7\u4e2a\u4f53\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5408\u6210\uff1b5\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u5927\u8111\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u504f\u597d\u523a\u6fc0\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuroVolve\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u795e\u7ecf\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u523a\u6fc0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8111\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8111\u9a71\u52a8\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u63a2\u6d4b\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

Existing methods face a tradeoff, where producing rich open-vocabulary descriptions comes at the expense of real-time performance when these descriptions have to be grounded in 3D. To address these challenges, we propose Describe Anything, Anywhere, at Any Moment (DAAAM), a novel spatio-temporal memory framework for large-scale and real-time 4D scene understanding. DAAAM introduces a novel optimization-based frontend to infer detailed semantic descriptions from localized captioning models, such as the Describe Anything Model (DAM), leveraging batch processing to speed up inference by an order of magnitude for online processing. It leverages such semantic understanding to build a hierarchical 4D scene graph (SG), which acts as an effective globally spatially and temporally consistent memory representation. DAAAM constructs 4D SGs with detailed, geometrically grounded descriptions while maintaining real-time performance. We show that DAAAM's 4D SG interfaces well with a tool-calling agent for inference and reasoning.\n  We thoroughly evaluate DAAAM in the complex task of spatio-temporal question answering on the NaVQA benchmark and show its generalization capabilities for sequential task grounding on the SG3D benchmark.

In a within-subject study design, 57 participants assessed the responses under two conditions: harmful response plus its mitigation and solely mitigated response. Results revealed that participants' native language, AI work experience, and annotation familiarity significantly influenced evaluations.

While large language models have made automated report generation technically feasible, systematic research in this specific area remains notably absent, particularly lacking formal task definitions and corresponding benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we define the Automated Online Public Opinion Report Generation (OPOR-GEN) task and construct OPOR-BENCH, an event-centric dataset covering 463 crisis events with their corresponding news articles, social media posts, and a reference summary.

Despite its cultural and societal significance, satire comprehension, particularly in purely visual forms, remains a challenging task for current vision-language models. This task requires not only detecting satire but also deciphering its nuanced meaning and identifying the implicated entities. Existing models often fail to effectively integrate local entity relationships with global context, leading to misinterpretation, comprehension biases, and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose SatireDecoder, a training-free framework designed to enhance satirical image comprehension. Our approach proposes a multi-agent system performing visual cascaded decoupling to decompose images into fine-grained local and global semantic representations. In addition, we introduce a chain-of-thought reasoning strategy guided by uncertainty analysis, which breaks down the complex satire comprehension process into sequential subtasks with minimized uncertainty. Our method significantly improves interpretive accuracy while reducing hallucinations. Experimental results validate that SatireDecoder outperforms existing baselines in comprehending visual satire, offering a promising direction for vision-language reasoning in nuanced, high-level semantic tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SatireDecoder\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u7ea7\u8054\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bbd\u523a\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u91ca\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bbd\u523a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5e7d\u9ed8\u4e0e\u9690\u6666\u6279\u5224\u7684\u827a\u672f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u793e\u4f1a\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u8bbd\u523a\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u5b9e\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u89e3\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSatireDecoder\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6267\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u7ea7\u8054\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u8bbd\u523a\u7406\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eSatireDecoder\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bbd\u523a\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "SatireDecoder\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u5fae\u3001\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bbd\u523a\u7684\u9690\u542b\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u6d89\u53ca\u5b9e\u4f53\u3002"}}

To this end, we introduce latent debate, a novel framework for interpreting model predictions through the lens of implicit internal arguments. Unlike the current work of self-consistency and multi-agent debate, which relies on explicit debates among multiple answers or multiple models, latent debate captures the hidden supporting and attacking signals that arise within a single model during a single inference. We first present a model- and task-agnostic conceptual framework, and then instantiate it symbolically to approximate the thinking process of LLMs on True/False prediction tasks. Empirical studies demonstrate that latent debate is a faithful structured surrogate model that has highly consistent predictions with the original LLM. Beyond interpretability, we demonstrate that latent debate provides a strong baseline for hallucination detection. Further analysis reveals strong correlations between hallucinations and debate patterns, such as a high degree of latent debates in the middle layers is linked to a higher risk of hallucinations. These findings position latent debate as a potential framework for understanding internal mechanisms of LLMs, especially for scenarios where internal (dis)agreements appear during the inference steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u6f5c\u5728\u8fa9\u8bba\"\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5185\u90e8\u8bba\u8bc1\u6765\u89e3\u91caLLM\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u601d\u8003\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u4ea7\u751f\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u81ea\u6211\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u7b54\u6848\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8bba\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6f5c\u5728\u8fa9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3cLLM\u5728\u771f/\u5047\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u601d\u8003\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u652f\u6301\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u6f5c\u5728\u8fa9\u8bba\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0e\u539f\u59cbLLM\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e0e\u8fa9\u8bba\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6f5c\u5728\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e0e\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u98ce\u9669\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6f5c\u5728\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u5185\u90e8\uff08\u4e0d\uff09\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002"}}

We introduce MedCT-VLM: Medical CT Vision-Language Model, a parameter-efficient vision-language framework designed to adapt large-scale CT foundation models for downstream clinical tasks. MedCT-VLM uses a parameter-efficient approach to adapt CT-CLIP, a contrastive vision-language model trained on 25,692 chest CT volumes, for multi-label pathology classification using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Rather than fine-tuning the model's 440 M parameters directly, we insert low-rank decomposition matrices into attention layers of both vision and text encoders, training only 1.67M parameters (0.38\\% of total).

Despite these advances, long-CoT LLMs often exhibit suboptimal reasoning behaviors, such as overthinking and excessively protracted reasoning chains, which can impair performance. In this paper, we analyze reasoning processes through an optimization lens, framing CoT as a gradient descent procedure where each reasoning step constitutes an update toward problem resolution. Building on this perspective, we introduce RePro (Rectifying Process-level Reward), a novel approach to refine LLM reasoning during post-training. RePro defines a surrogate objective function to assess the optimization process underlying CoT, utilizing a dual scoring mechanism to quantify its intensity and stability. These scores are aggregated into a composite process-level reward, seamlessly integrated into reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines to optimize LLMs. Extensive experiments across multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and diverse LLMs, evaluated on benchmarks spanning mathematics, science, and coding, demonstrate that RePro consistently enhances reasoning performance and mitigates suboptimal reasoning behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "RePro\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u5316LLM\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u89c6\u4e3a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u8fc7\u957f\u7b49\u6b21\u4f18\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRePro\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5b9a\u4e49\u4ee3\u7406\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\u91cf\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u6570\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230RLVR\uff08\u5e26\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316LLM\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRePro\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6b21\u4f18\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "RePro\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u5316LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u89c6\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This study evaluates deep learning models -- YOLOv9, U-Net, Swin Transformer, DeepLabV3, and Mask R-CNN -- to automate the process efficiently. A dataset of 582 labeled images was dynamically augmented to improve generalization. Swin Transformer achieved the highest accuracy (0.94), excelling in fine segmentation. YOLOv9 performed well for bounding box detection but struggled with boundary precision. U-Net was effective for structured patterns, while DeepLabV3 captured multi-scale features with slight boundary imprecision. Mask R-CNN initially underperformed due to overlapping detections, but applying Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) improved its IoU from 0.45 to 0.80. Generalizability was next tested using an oak dataset of 11 images from Oregon State University's Tree Ring Lab. Additionally, for exploratory analysis purposes, an additional dataset of 64 labeled tree cross-sections was used to train the worst-performing model to see if this would improve its performance generalizing to the unseen oak dataset.

However, most existing DRAs were validated on question-answering benchmarks, while research on generating comprehensive reports remains overlooked. Worse, current benchmarks for report synthesis suffer from task complexity and subjective metrics -- this fails to reflect user demands and limits the practical utility of generated reports. To address these gaps, we present Fine-grained DEepResearch bench (FINDER), an enhanced benchmark consisting of 100 human-curated research tasks with 419 structured checklist items that standardize report structure, analytical depth, and factual grounding. Based on approximately 1,000 reports produced by mainstream DRAs, we further propose Deep rEsearch Failure Taxonomy (DEFT), the first failure taxonomy for deep research agents. DEFT contains 14 fine-grained failure modes across reasoning, retrieval, and generation, and is built upon grounded theory with human-LLM co-annotating and inter-annotator reliability validation. Our experimental findings reveal that current DRAs struggle not with task comprehension but with evidence integration, verification, and reasoning-resilient planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FINDER\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cDEFT\u5931\u8d25\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5206\u6790\u62a5\u544a\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u6574\u5408\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u4e3b\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e8e\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u5168\u9762\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u62a5\u544a\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4e3b\u89c2\u6307\u6807\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFINDER\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b100\u4e2a\u4eba\u5de5\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u548c419\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u68c0\u67e5\u9879\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea61000\u4efd\u4e3b\u6d41DRA\u751f\u6210\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDEFT\u5931\u8d25\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b14\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u624e\u6839\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4eba-LLM\u534f\u540c\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u95f4\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524dDRAs\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u6574\u5408\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5f39\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "FINDER\u57fa\u51c6\u548cDEFT\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

The approach utilizes Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) for per class data augmentation to resolve the critical class imbalance problem. A fine-tuned ResNet-50 classifier is then trained on the augmented dataset to classify seven skin disease categories. Crucially, LIME and SHAP Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are integrated to provide transparency by confirming that predictions are based on clinically relevant features like irregular morphology. The system achieved a high overall Accuracy of 92.50 % and a Macro-AUC of 98.82 %, successfully outperforming various prior benchmarked architectures.

However, a systematic comparison of well-known TTS strategies under identical conditions is missing, and the influence of model type and problem difficulty on performance remains unclear. To address these gaps, we conduct the first large-scale study of TTS, spanning over thirty billion tokens generated using eight open-source LLMs (7B to 235B parameters), across four reasoning datasets. We observe three consistent trends: (1) no single TTS strategy universally dominates; (2) reasoning models exhibit distinct trace-quality patterns across problem difficulty and trace length, forming short-horizon and long-horizon categories; and (3) for a given model type, the optimal TTS performance scales monotonically with compute budget. Based on these insights, we provide a practical recipe for selecting the best TTS strategy, considering problem difficulty, model type, and compute budget, providing a practical guide to effective inference-time scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\uff08TTS\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e868\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57284\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00TTS\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u666e\u904d\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73TTS\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\uff08TTS\uff09\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u77e5\u540dTTS\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21TTS\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6db5\u76d68\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff087B\u5230235B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u57284\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7300\u4ebf\u4e2atoken\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cTTS\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e00\u81f4\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1a1\uff09\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00TTS\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u666e\u904d\u6700\u4f18\uff1b2\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u77ed\u89c6\u754c\u548c\u957f\u89c6\u754c\u4e24\u7c7b\uff1b3\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u6700\u4f18TTS\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u5355\u8c03\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73TTS\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

Accurate segmentation of thyroid nodules is a critical first step in the development of AI-assisted clinical decision support systems. This study focuses on instance segmentation of thyroid nodules using YOLOv5 algorithms on ultrasound images. We evaluated multiple YOLOv5 variants (Nano, Small, Medium, Large, and XLarge) across two dataset versions, with and without doppler images. The YOLOv5-Large algorithm achieved the highest performance with a dice score of 91\\% and mAP of 0.87 on the dataset including doppler images. Notably, our results demonstrate that doppler images, typically excluded by physicians, can significantly improve segmentation performance. The YOLOv5-Small model achieved 79\\% dice score when doppler images were excluded, while including them improved performance across all model variants.

However, to accelerate computation with NVFP4, all matrix multiplication operands--weights and activations in the forward pass, and weights, activations, and gradients in the backward pass--must be quantized to NVFP4, often leading to divergence during training and performance degradation during inference. NVFP4 by evaluating multiple potential scale factors for each block of values. To address this issue, in this work we introduce Four Over Six (4/6), a modification to the NVFP4 quantization algorithm that evaluates two potential scale factors for each block of values. Unlike integer formats, floating-point formats such as FP4 have the most quantization error on near-maximal values in each block, which we find to be primarily responsible for downstream performance degradation. We find that for some blocks, scaling to smaller FP4 values makes the distribution of representable values more uniform, improving representation of near-maximal values. Importantly, 4/6 can be implemented efficiently on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, making it viable to use while training LLMs with NVFP4. In pre-training experiments with transformer and hybrid model architectures, we find that 4/6 prevents divergence in several cases, bringing training loss significantly closer to BF16 compared to models trained with current state-of-the-art NVFP4 training recipes. We also find that 4/6 can be easily incorporated into many different post-training quantization methods and generally improves downstream accuracy. We hope this inspires future work in training and deploying models with NVFP4.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa4/6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdbNVFP4\u91cf\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u4e2a\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d1\u6563\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "NVFP4\u7b49\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6570\u503c\u683c\u5f0f\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u8282\u7701\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\uff08\u6743\u91cd\u3001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u4e3aNVFP4\uff0c\u8fd9\u5e38\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d1\u6563\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u6d6e\u70b9\u683c\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5757\u4e2d\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5927\u503c\u7684\u6570\u503c\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFour Over Six (4/6)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5bf9NVFP4\u91cf\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c4/6\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6570\u503c\u5757\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7f29\u653e\u5230\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684FP4\u503c\uff0c\u4f7f\u53ef\u8868\u793a\u503c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u5747\u5300\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8868\u793a\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5927\u503c\u7684\u6570\u503c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728NVIDIA Blackwell GPU\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728Transformer\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c4/6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u663e\u8457\u63a5\u8fd1BF16\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684NVFP4\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u30024/6\u8fd8\u80fd\u8f7b\u677e\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u666e\u904d\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "4/6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86NVFP4\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528NVFP4\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u672a\u6765\u5728NVFP4\u4e0a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Existing token reduction approaches typically adopt token pruning or merging to reduce computation. However, they inherently lead to information loss, as they discard or compress token representations. This problem is exacerbated when applied uniformly to fine-grained token representations across all images, regardless of visual complexity. We observe that not all inputs require fine-grained processing. Simple images can be effectively handled at coarse resolution, while only complex ones may warrant refinement. Based on this insight, we propose \\textit{Coarse-to-Fine Vision Mamba (CF-ViM)}, an adaptive framework for efficient inference. CF-ViM first performs coarse-grained inference by dividing the input image into large patches, significantly reducing the token length and computation. When the model's prediction confidence is low, selected regions are re-processed at a finer resolution to recover critical visual details with minimal additional cost. This dynamic resolution assignment strategy allows CF-ViM to allocate computation adaptively according to image complexity, ensuring efficient processing without compromising essential visual information.

This study presents SAFE (system for accurate fact extraction and evaluation), an agent system that combines large language models with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve automated fact-checking of long-form COVID-19 misinformation. SAFE includes two agents - one for claim extraction and another for claim verification using LOTR-RAG, which leverages a 130,000-document COVID-19 research corpus. An enhanced variant, SAFE (LOTR-RAG + SRAG), incorporates Self-RAG to refine retrieval via query rewriting. We evaluated both systems on 50 fake news articles (2-17 pages) containing 246 annotated claims (M = 4.922, SD = 3.186), labeled as true (14.1%), partly true (14.4%), false (27.0%), partly false (2.2%), and misleading (21.0%) by public health professionals. SAFE systems significantly outperformed baseline LLMs in all metrics (p < 0.001). For consistency (0-1 scale), SAFE (LOTR-RAG) scored 0.629, exceeding both SAFE (+SRAG) (0.577) and the baseline (0.279). In subjective evaluations (0-4 Likert scale), SAFE (LOTR-RAG) also achieved the highest average ratings in usefulness (3.640), clearness (3.800), and authenticity (3.526). Adding SRAG slightly reduced overall performance, except for a minor gain in clearness.

A prime example of such complex tasks is modelling resource allocation optimization in networks, which extends beyond translating natural language inputs into mathematical equations or Linear Programming (LP), Integer Linear Programming (ILP), and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models. However, existing benchmarks and datasets cannot address the complexities of such problems with dynamic environments, interdependent variables, and heterogeneous constraints. To address this gap, we introduce NL4RA, a curated dataset comprising 50 resource allocation optimization problems formulated as LP, ILP, and MILP. We then evaluate the performance of well-known open-source LLMs with varying parameter counts. To enhance existing LLM based methods, we introduce LM4Opt RA, a multi candidate framework that applies diverse prompting strategies such as direct, few shot, and chain of thought, combined with a structured ranking mechanism to improve accuracy. We identified discrepancies between human judgments and automated scoring such as ROUGE, BLEU, or BERT scores. However, human evaluation is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise, making it impractical for a fully automated end-to-end framework. To quantify the difference between LLM-generated responses and ground truth, we introduce LLM-Assisted Mathematical Evaluation (LAME), an automated metric designed for mathematical formulations. Using LM4Opt-RA, Llama-3.1-70B achieved a LAME score of 0.8007, outperforming other models by a significant margin, followed closely by Llama-3.1-8B. While baseline LLMs demonstrate considerable promise, they still lag behind human expertise; our proposed method surpasses these baselines regarding LAME and other metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faNL4RA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cLM4Opt-RA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165LAME\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u3001\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "1) \u521b\u5efaNL4RA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0850\u4e2aLP/ILP/MILP\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff09\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51faLM4Opt-RA\u591a\u5019\u9009\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165LAME\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "Llama-3.1-70B\u5728LM4Opt-RA\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f970.8007\u7684LAME\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\uff0cLlama-3.1-8B\u7d27\u968f\u5176\u540e\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LAME\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebfLLM\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u7ebfLLM\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u4ecd\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LM4Opt-RA\u6846\u67b6\u548cLAME\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, text-driven 4D scene editing remains under-explored due to the challenge of ensuring both multi-view and temporal consistency across space and time during editing. Existing studies rely on 2D diffusion models that edit frames independently, often causing motion distortion, geometric drift, and incomplete editing. We introduce Dynamic-eDiTor, a training-free text-driven 4D editing framework leveraging Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) and 4DGS. This mechanism consists of Spatio-Temporal Sub-Grid Attention (STGA) for locally consistent cross-view and temporal fusion, and Context Token Propagation (CTP) for global propagation via token inheritance and optical-flow-guided token replacement. Together, these components allow Dynamic-eDiTor to perform seamless, globally consistent multi-view video without additional training and directly optimize pre-trained source 4DGS. Extensive experiments on multi-view video dataset DyNeRF demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing fidelity and both multi-view and temporal consistency prior approaches.

Building a unified gait foundation model requires addressing two longstanding barriers: (a) Scalability. Why have gait models historically failed to follow scaling laws? (b) Generalization. Can one model serve the diverse gait tasks that have traditionally been studied in isolation? We introduce FoundationGait, the first scalable, self-supervised pretraining framework for gait understanding. Its largest version has nearly 0.13 billion parameters and is pretrained on 12 public gait datasets comprising over 2 million walking sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FoundationGait, with or without fine-tuning, performs robustly across a wide spectrum of gait datasets, conditions, tasks (e.g., human identification, scoliosis screening, depression prediction, and attribute estimation), and even input modality. Notably, it achieves 48.0% zero-shot rank-1 accuracy on the challenging in-the-wild Gait3D dataset (1,000 test subjects) and 64.5% on the largest in-the-lab OU-MVLP dataset (5,000+ test subjects), setting a new milestone in robust gait recognition.

These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs as standalone classifiers for structured financial modeling, but also instill optimism that improved explainability mechanisms coupled with few-shot prompting will make LLMs usable in risk-sensitive domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0eSHAP\u503c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0eLightGBM\u7684SHAP\u503c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u91d1\u878d\u5efa\u6a21\u72ec\u7acb\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5176SHAP\u503c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83LLMs\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u7279\u5f81\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0eSHAP\u503c\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caLLMs\u4e0eLightGBM SHAP\u503c\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u7684\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u7279\u5f81\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0eSHAP\u503c\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u4e14LLMs\u4e0eLightGBM\u7684SHAP\u503c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u660eLLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u91d1\u878d\u5efa\u6a21\u72ec\u7acb\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u91d1\u878d\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u6709\u671b\u4f7fLLMs\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u7528\u3002"}}

We aim to explicitly specify where stability lives and where plasticity should be focused under realistic memory and privacy constraints. We introduce Affordance-First Decomposition (AFD): videos are mapped to slowly varying affordance tokens that form a shared, time-aligned substrate, while a lightweight, query-routed, conflict-aware scheduler concentrates adaptation and grows capacity only when needed. The substrate is stabilized via weak alignment and teacher consistency, and training uses question-only replay. AFD achieves state-of-the-art across protocols: 51.6% average accuracy with -1.8% forgetting on domain-incremental VideoQA, ViLCo R@1@0.5 of 29.6% (MQ) and 20.7% (NLQ) with 18.4% stAP@0.25 (VQ), and 39.5% accuracy with -1.6% forgetting on time-incremental iVQA.

Existing summarization approaches typically rely on surface-level textual cues, resulting in incomplete or redundant summaries, and they frequently ignore associated code snippets, which are essential for accurate defect diagnosis.

Our approach incrementally incorporates long code snippets alongside textual content, overcoming standard LLM context window constraints and producing semantically rich summaries. Evaluated on four benchmark datasets using eight LLMs, our pipeline outperforms extractive baselines by 7.5%-58.2% and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art abstractive methods, highlighting the benefits of jointly leveraging textual and code information for enhanced bug comprehension.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7801\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u62a5\u544a\u6458\u8981\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u6574\u5408\u957f\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u6807\u51c6LLM\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6458\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u9677\u62a5\u544a\u901a\u5e38\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u5197\u957f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6458\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u5c42\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6458\u8981\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6216\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u4e14\u7ecf\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ee3\u7801\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u7f3a\u9677\u8bca\u65ad\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7801\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5c06\u957f\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u6807\u51c6LLM\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u7f3a\u9677\u62a5\u544a\u6458\u8981\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u516b\u4e2aLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ba1\u9053\u6bd4\u63d0\u53d6\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53477.5%-58.2%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u597d\u5904\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7801\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670dLLM\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u62a5\u544a\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f3a\u9677\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, principled hallucination mitigation remains a critical challenge.In this work, we first analyze the data generation process in LVLM hallucination mitigation and affirm that on-policy data significantly outperforms off-policy data, which thus calls for efficient and reliable preference annotation of on-policy data. We then point out that, existing annotation methods introduce additional hallucination in training samples, which may enhance the model's hallucination patterns, to address this problem, we propose training a hallucination classifier giving binary annotations, which guarantee clean chosen samples for the subsequent alignment. To further harness of the power of on-policy data, we design a robust iterative direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithm adopting a dynamic sample reweighting scheme. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmarks with comparison to 8 state-of-the-art baselines.

Conventional fixed-length and recursive splitters often produce arbitrary, incoherent segments that fail to preserve semantic structure. Although semantic chunking has gained traction, its influence on generation quality remains underexplored. This paper introduces two efficient semantic chunking methods, Projected Similarity Chunking (PSC) and Metric Fusion Chunking (MFC), trained on PubMed data using three different embedding models. We further present an evaluation framework that measures the effect of chunking on both retrieval and generation by augmenting PubMedQA with full-text PubMed Central articles. Our results show substantial retrieval improvements (24x with PSC) in MRR and higher Hits@k on PubMedQA. We provide a comprehensive analysis, including statistical significance and response-time comparisons with common chunking libraries. Despite being trained on a single domain, PSC and MFC also generalize well, achieving strong out-of-domain generation performance across multiple datasets.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, have enabled transformative progress in medical imaging analysis. Deep learning-based computer vision models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers, and hybrid attention architectures, can automatically extract complex spatial, morphological, and temporal patterns from multimodal imaging data including MRI, CT, PET, mammography, histopathology, and ultrasound. These models surpass traditional radiological assessment by identifying subtle tissue abnormalities and tumor microenvironment variations invisible to the human eye. At a broader scale, the integration of multimodal imaging with radiogenomics linking quantitative imaging features with genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenetic biomarkers has introduced a new paradigm for personalized oncology.

Our analysis shows substantial differences in user representation, with most studies focusing on limited sociodemographic attributes and only 35% discussing the representativeness of their LLM personae.

However, existing IIS methods, primarily designed for natural images, struggle to generalize to remote sensing domains due to limited annotated data and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we proposed RS-ISRefiner, a novel click-based IIS framework tailored for remote sensing images. The framework employs an adapter-based tuning strategy that preserves the general representations of Vision Foundation Models while enabling efficient learning of remote sensing-specific spatial and boundary characteristics. A hybrid attention mechanism integrating convolutional local modeling with Transformer-based global reasoning enhances robustness against scale diversity and scene complexity. Furthermore, an improved probability map modulation scheme effectively incorporates historical user interactions, yielding more stable iterative refinement and higher boundary fidelity. Comprehensive experiments on six remote sensing datasets, including iSAID, ISPRS Potsdam, SandBar, NWPU, LoveDA Urban and WHUBuilding, demonstrate that RS-ISRefiner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IIS methods in terms of segmentation accuracy, efficiency and interaction cost.

Trdaitional QSAR models that utilizes molecular descriptor based data often struggles to predict bioactivity of molecules effectively due to its limitation in capturing structural and contextual information embedded within each compound. To address this challenge, we propose Rep3Net, a unified deep learning architecture that not only incorporates descriptor data but also includes spatial and relational information through graph-based represenation of compounds and contextual information through ChemBERTa generated embeddings from SMILES strings. Our model employing multimodal concatenated features produce reliable bioactivity prediction on Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) dataset.

While these systems can extract effective environmental features for planning, relying on auxiliary perception tasks, developing perception annotation-free planning paradigms has become increasingly critical due to the high cost of manual perception annotation. In this work, we propose TrajDiff, a Trajectory-oriented BEV Conditioned Diffusion framework that establishes a fully perception annotation-free generative method for end-to-end autonomous driving. TrajDiff requires only raw sensor inputs and future trajectory, constructing Gaussian BEV heatmap targets that inherently capture driving modalities. We design a simple yet effective trajectory-oriented BEV encoder to extract the TrajBEV feature without perceptual supervision. Furthermore, we introduce Trajectory-oriented BEV Diffusion Transformer (TB-DiT), which leverages ego-state information and the predicted TrajBEV features to directly generate diverse yet plausible trajectories, eliminating the need for handcrafted motion priors. Beyond architectural innovations, TrajDiff enables exploration of data scaling benefits in the annotation-free setting. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, TrajDiff achieves 87.5 PDMS, establishing state-of-the-art performance among all annotation-free methods. With data scaling, it further improves to 88.5 PDMS, which is comparable to advanced perception-based approaches.

Existing guardrails often fail when faced with indirect or contextually complex bias-inducing prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a unified framework for both systematic bias evaluation and targeted mitigation. Our approach introduces six novel Metamorphic Relations (MRs) that, based on metamorphic testing principles, transform direct bias-inducing inputs into semantically equivalent yet adversarially challenging variants. These transformations enable an automated method for exposing hidden model biases: when an LLM responds inconsistently or unfairly across MR-generated variants, the underlying bias becomes detectable. We further show that the same MRs can be used to generate diverse bias-inducing samples for fine-tuning, directly linking the testing process to mitigation. Using six state-of-the-art LLMs - spanning open-source and proprietary models - and a representative subset of 385 questions from the 8,978-item BiasAsker benchmark covering seven protected groups, our MRs reveal up to 14% more hidden biases compared to existing tools. Moreover, fine-tuning with both original and MR-mutated samples significantly enhances bias resiliency, increasing safe response rates from 54.7% to over 88.9% across models.

(1) \\textit{Shared credit assignment}: trajectory-level advantages derived from group-normalized sparse terminal rewards are uniformly applied across timesteps, failing to accurately estimate the potential of early denoising steps with vast exploration spaces. (2) \\textit{Reward-mixing}: predefined weights for combining multi-objective rewards (e.g., text accuracy, visual quality, text color)--which have mismatched scales and variances--lead to unstable gradients and conflicting updates. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{Multi-GRPO}, a multi-group advantage estimation framework with two orthogonal grouping mechanisms. For better credit assignment, we introduce tree-based trajectories inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search: branching trajectories at selected early denoising steps naturally forms \\emph{temporal groups}, enabling accurate advantage estimation for early steps via descendant leaves while amortizing computation through shared prefixes. For multi-objective optimization, we introduce \\emph{reward-based grouping} to compute advantages for each reward function \\textit{independently} before aggregation, disentangling conflicting signals. To facilitate evaluation of multiple objective alignment, we curate \\textit{OCR-Color-10}, a visual text rendering dataset with explicit color constraints. Across the single-reward \\textit{PickScore-25k} and multi-objective \\textit{OCR-Color-10} benchmarks, Multi-GRPO achieves superior stability and alignment performance, effectively balancing conflicting objectives.

Present affiliation: Iambic Therapeutics", "summary": "This work presents the development and evaluation of an NLP-enabled probabilistic classifier designed to estimate the probability of technical and regulatory success (pTRS) for clinical trials in the field of neuroscience. While pharmaceutical R&D is plagued by high attrition rates and enormous costs, particularly within neuroscience, where success rates are below 10%, timely identification of promising programs can streamline resource allocation and reduce financial risk. Leveraging data from the ClinicalTrials.gov database and success labels from the recently developed Clinical Trial Outcome dataset, the classifier extracts text-based clinical trial features using statistical NLP techniques. These features were integrated into several non-LLM frameworks (logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest) to generate calibrated probability scores. Model performance was assessed on a retrospective dataset of 101,145 completed clinical trials spanning 1976-2024, achieving an overall ROC-AUC of 0.64. An LLM-based predictive model was then built using BioBERT, a domain-specific language representation encoder. The BioBERT-based model achieved an overall ROC-AUC of 0.74 and a Brier Score of 0.185, indicating its predictions had, on average, 40% less squared error than would be observed using industry benchmarks. The BioBERT-based model also made trial outcome predictions that were superior to benchmark values 70% of the time overall. By integrating NLP-driven insights into drug development decision-making, this work aims to enhance strategic planning and optimize investment allocation in neuroscience programs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1NLP\u6982\u7387\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u76d1\u7ba1\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387(pTRS)\uff0cBioBERT\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u836f\u7269\u7814\u53d1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e10%\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ca\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u8d22\u52a1\u98ce\u9669", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ClinicalTrials.gov\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1NLP\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u53d6\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7b49\u975eLLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eBioBERT\u7684LLM\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b", "result": "\u57281976-2024\u5e74101,145\u4e2a\u5df2\u5b8c\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u56de\u987e\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578bROC-AUC\u4e3a0.64\uff0cBioBERT\u6a21\u578bROC-AUC\u8fbe0.74\uff0cBrier Score\u4e3a0.185\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u6bd4\u884c\u4e1a\u57fa\u51c6\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1140%\uff0c70%\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6", "conclusion": "NLP\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u5f00\u53d1\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6295\u8d44\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212"}}

The advantages of learned image compression methods over traditional image codecs can be largely attributed to their powerful nonlinear transform coding. Convolutional layers and shifted window transformer (Swin-T) blocks are the basic units of neural networks, and their representation capabilities play an important role in nonlinear transform coding. In this paper, to improve the ability of the vanilla convolution to extract local features, we propose a novel prior-guided convolution (PGConv), where asymmetric convolutions (AConvs) and difference convolutions (DConvs) are introduced to strengthen skeleton elements and extract high-frequency information, respectively. A re-parameterization strategy is also used to reduce the computational complexity of PGConv. Moreover, to improve the ability of the Swin-T block to extract non-local features, we propose a novel multi-scale gated transformer (MGT), where dilated window-based multi-head self-attention blocks with different dilation rates and depth-wise convolution layers with different kernel sizes are used to extract multi-scale features, and a gate mechanism is introduced to enhance non-linearity. Finally, we propose a novel joint Multi-scale Gated Transformer and Prior-guided Convolutional Network (MGTPCN) for learned image compression.

While foundational, existing models like SpecTTTra falter when faced with the diverse and rapidly advancing ecosystem of new generators, exhibiting significant performance drops on out-of-distribution (OOD) content. This generalization failure highlights a critical gap: the need for more challenging benchmarks and more robust detection architectures. To address this, we first introduce Melody or Machine (MoM), a new large-scale benchmark of over 130,000 songs (6,665 hours). MoM is the most diverse dataset to date, built with a mix of open and closed-source models and a curated OOD test set designed specifically to foster the development of truly generalizable detectors. Alongside this benchmark, we introduce CLAM, a novel dual-stream detection architecture. We hypothesize that subtle, machine-induced inconsistencies between vocal and instrumental elements, often imperceptible in a mixed signal, offer a powerful tell-tale sign of synthesis. CLAM is designed to test this hypothesis by employing two distinct pre-trained audio encoders (MERT and Wave2Vec2) to create parallel representations of the audio. These representations are fused by a learnable cross-aggregation module that models their inter-dependencies.

To address this challenge, previous works formulated the multi-rater medical image segmentation task, where multiple experts provide separate annotations for each image. However, existing models are typically constrained to either generate diverse segmentation that lacks expert specificity or to produce personalized outputs that merely replicate individual annotators. We propose Probabilistic modeling of multi-rater medical image Segmentation (ProSeg) that simultaneously enables both diversification and personalization. Specifically, we introduce two latent variables to model expert annotation preferences and image boundary ambiguity. Their conditional probabilistic distributions are then obtained through variational inference, allowing segmentation outputs to be generated by sampling from these distributions. Extensive experiments on both the nasopharyngeal carcinoma dataset (NPC) and the lung nodule dataset (LIDC-IDRI) demonstrate that our ProSeg achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, providing segmentation results that are both diverse and expert-personalized.

Motivated by the observed human-like behaviors in their reasoning processes, this paper introduces a comprehensive taxonomy to characterize atomic reasoning steps and probe the ``psyche'' of LRM intelligence. Specifically, it comprises five groups and seventeen categories derived from human mental processes, thereby grounding the understanding of LRMs in an interdisciplinary perspective. The taxonomy is then applied for an in-depth understanding of current LRMs, resulting in a distinct labeled dataset that comprises 277,534 atomic reasoning steps. Using this resource, we analyze contemporary LRMs and distill several actionable takeaways for improving training and post-training of reasoning models. Notably, our analysis reveals that prevailing post-answer ``double-checks'' (self-monitoring evaluations) are largely superficial and rarely yield substantive revisions. Thus, incentivizing comprehensive multi-step reflection, rather than simple self-monitoring, may offer a more effective path forward. To complement the taxonomy, an automatic annotation framework, named CAPO, is proposed to leverage large language models (LLMs) for generating the taxonomy-based annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that CAPO achieves higher consistency with human experts compared to baselines, facilitating a scalable and comprehensive analysis of LRMs from a human cognitive perspective. Together, the taxonomy, CAPO, and the derived insights provide a principled, scalable path toward understanding and advancing LRM reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5fc3\u667a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b5\u7ec417\u7c7b\u539f\u5b50\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6846\u67b6CAPO\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u68c0\u673a\u5236\u8f83\u4e3a\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6b65\u53cd\u601d\u6539\u8fdb\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\"\u5fc3\u667a\"\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u89c6\u89d2\u5efa\u7acb\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5fc3\u667a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b5\u7ec417\u7c7b\u539f\u5b50\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b2) \u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6846\u67b6CAPO\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5206\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b3) \u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b277,534\u4e2a\u539f\u5b50\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b4) \u5206\u6790\u5f53\u4ee3\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "1) CAPO\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b2) \u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540e\u7b54\u6848\"\u53cc\u91cd\u68c0\u67e5\"\uff08\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\u5927\u591a\u8868\u9762\u5316\uff0c\u5f88\u5c11\u4ea7\u751f\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u4fee\u8ba2\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u6fc0\u52b1\u5168\u9762\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u53cd\u601d\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u3001CAPO\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u5206\u6790\u89c1\u89e3\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u8fdb\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6307\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

However, applying these tools to scientific charts rests on a flawed assumption: a chart is not merely an arrangement of pixels but a visual representation of structured data governed by a graphical grammar. Consequently, chart editing is not a pixel-manipulation task but a structured transformation problem. To address this fundamental mismatch, we introduce \\textit{FigEdit}, a large-scale benchmark for scientific figure editing comprising over 30,000 samples. Grounded in real-world data, our benchmark is distinguished by its diversity, covering 10 distinct chart types and a rich vocabulary of complex editing instructions. The benchmark is organized into five distinct and progressively challenging tasks: single edits, multi edits, conversational edits, visual-guidance-based edits, and style transfer. Our evaluation of a range of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark reveals their poor performance on scientific figures, as they consistently fail to handle the underlying structured transformations required for valid edits.

Chatbots have been used in healthcare to provide clinical support and enhance the user experience, making it possible to provide meaningful clinical patterns from text-based data through chatbots. The proposed research utilises several different natural language processing methods to study the occurrences of symptom descriptions in medicine as well as analyse the patterns that emerge through these conversations within medical bots. Through the use of the Medical Conversations to Disease Dataset which contains 960 multi-turn dialogues divided into 24 Clinical Conditions, a standardised representation of conversations between patient and bot is created for further analysis by computational means. The multi-method approach uses a variety of tools, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify latent symptom themes, K-Means to group symptom descriptions by similarity, Transformer-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract medical concepts, and the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent symptom pairs. Findings from the analysis indicate a coherent structure of clinically relevant topics, moderate levels of clustering cohesiveness and several high confidence rates on the relationships between symptoms like fever headache and rash itchiness. The results support the notion that conversational medical data can be a valuable diagnostic signal for early symptom interpretation, assist in strengthening decision support and improve how users interact with tele-health technology.

In this paper, we study how to recover the invisible forces from visual observations, e.g., estimating the wind field by observing a leaf falling to the ground. Our key innovation is an end-to-end differentiable inverse graphics framework, which jointly models object geometry, physical properties, and interactions directly from videos. Through backpropagation, our approach enables the recovery of force representations from object motions. We validate our method on both synthetic and real-world scenarios, and the results demonstrate its ability to infer plausible force fields from videos. Furthermore, we show the potential applications of our approach, including physics-based video generation and editing.

Yet, their internal structures remain opaque, with existing approaches often sacrificing semantic coherence for structural regularity or incurring high computational overhead to improve interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce the Semantic Field Subspace (SFS), a geometry-preserving, context-aware representation that captures local semantic neighborhoods within the embedding space. We also propose SAFARI (SemAntic Field subspAce deteRmInation), an unsupervised, modality-agnostic algorithm that uncovers hierarchical semantic structures using a novel metric called Semantic Shift, which quantifies how semantics evolve as SFSes evolve. To ensure scalability, we develop an efficient approximation of Semantic Shift that replaces costly SVD computations, achieving a 15~30x speedup with average errors below 0.01. Extensive evaluations across six real-world text and image datasets show that SFSes outperform standard classifiers not only in classification but also in nuanced tasks such as political bias detection, while SAFARI consistently reveals interpretable and generalizable semantic hierarchies.

These attacks can cause misclassification, leading to erroneous driving decisions that compromise road safety. Moreover, within V2X networks, such misinterpretations can propagate, inducing cascading failures that disrupt overall traffic flow and system stability. However, a key limitation of current physical attacks is their lack of stealth. Most methods apply perturbations to central regions of the sign, resulting in visually salient patterns that are easily detectable by human observers, thereby limiting their real-world practicality. This study proposes TESP-Attack, a novel stealth-aware adversarial patch method for traffic sign classification. Based on the observation that human visual attention primarily focuses on the central regions of traffic signs, we employ instance segmentation to generate edge-aligned masks that conform to the shape characteristics of the signs. A U-Net generator is utilized to craft adversarial patches, which are then optimized through color and texture constraints along with frequency domain analysis to achieve seamless integration with the background environment, resulting in highly effective visual concealment. The proposed method demonstrates outstanding attack success rates across traffic sign classification models with varied architectures, achieving over 90% under limited query budgets. It also exhibits strong cross-model transferability and maintains robust real-world performance that remains stable under varying angles and distances.", "AI": {"tldr": "TESP-Attack\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u9690\u853d\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u7f18\u5bf9\u9f50\u63a9\u7801\u548cU-Net\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5236\u4f5c\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u65e0\u7f1d\u878d\u5408\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u9690\u853d\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9690\u853d\u6027\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u6dfb\u52a0\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u667a\u80fd\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f15\u53d1\u9a7e\u9a76\u51b3\u7b56\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u9053\u8def\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u5e76\u5728V2X\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u7ea7\u8054\u6545\u969c\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u6807\u5fd7\u5f62\u72b6\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u5bf9\u9f50\u63a9\u7801\u3002\u91c7\u7528U-Net\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5236\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u989c\u8272\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u53ca\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u73af\u5883\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u9690\u853d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8d85\u8fc790%\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TESP-Attack\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9690\u853d\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u9690\u853d\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This paper studies and advocates for the latter case, where data are generated in an iterative, closed-loop fashion that is guided by the current state of the student model. For a fixed budget of generated samples, or a budget in terms of compute spent querying a teacher, we show that this curation of finetuning data affords improved student performance over static generation.

Recent methods like DUSt3R demonstrate that regressing dense pointmaps from image pairs enables accurate and efficient pose-free reconstruction. However, existing RGB-only approaches struggle under real-world conditions involving dynamic objects and extreme illumination, due to the inherent limitations of conventional cameras. In this paper, we propose EAG3R, a novel geometry estimation framework that augments pointmap-based reconstruction with asynchronous event streams. Built upon the MonST3R backbone, EAG3R introduces two key innovations: (1) a retinex-inspired image enhancement module and a lightweight event adapter with SNR-aware fusion mechanism that adaptively combines RGB and event features based on local reliability; and (2) a novel event-based photometric consistency loss that reinforces spatiotemporal coherence during global optimization. Our method enables robust geometry estimation in challenging dynamic low-light scenes without requiring retraining on night-time data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EAG3R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RGB-only baselines across monocular depth estimation, camera pose tracking, and dynamic reconstruction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "EAG3R\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u7684\u65b03D\u51e0\u4f55\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4f4e\u5149\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RGB-only\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RGB-only\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u673a\u6709\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u76843D\u51e0\u4f55\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMonST3R\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Retinex\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528SNR\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u5149\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684RGB-only\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "EAG3R\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408RGB\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u4f4e\u5149\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d23D\u51e0\u4f55\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u591c\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3"}}

We introduce LEGIT (LEGal Issue Trees), a novel large-scale (24K instances) expert-level legal reasoning dataset with an emphasis on reasoning trace evaluation. We convert court judgments into hierarchical trees of opposing parties' arguments and the court's conclusions, which serve as rubrics for evaluating the issue coverage and correctness of the reasoning traces. We verify the reliability of these rubrics via human expert annotations and comparison with coarse, less informative rubrics. Using the LEGIT dataset, we show that (1) LLMs' legal reasoning ability is seriously affected by both legal issue coverage and correctness, and that (2) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and RL with rubrics bring complementary benefits for legal reasoning abilities, where RAG improves overall reasoning capability, whereas RL improves correctness albeit with reduced coverage.", "AI": {"tldr": "LEGIT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6cd5\u5f8b\u95ee\u9898\u6811\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b24K\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6cd5\u5ead\u5224\u51b3\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8bba\u8bc1\u6811\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u6cd5\u5f8b\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6b64\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6cd5\u5ead\u5224\u51b3\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7acb\u53cc\u65b9\u8bba\u8bc1\u548c\u6cd5\u5ead\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u95ee\u9898\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7c97\u7cd9\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5c11\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "1.

Using this pipeline, we build two resources: an image-caption dataset (DEJIMA-Cap) and a VQA dataset (DEJIMA-VQA), each containing 3.88M image-text pairs, far exceeding the size of existing Japanese V&L datasets. Human evaluations demonstrate that DEJIMA achieves substantially higher Japaneseness and linguistic naturalness than datasets constructed via translation or manual annotation, while maintaining factual correctness at a level comparable to human-annotated corpora. Quantitative analyses of image feature distributions further confirm that DEJIMA broadly covers diverse visual domains characteristic of Japan, complementing its linguistic and cultural representativeness. Models trained on DEJIMA exhibit consistent improvements across multiple Japanese multimodal benchmarks, confirming that culturally grounded, large-scale resources play a key role in enhancing model performance.

The method improved the baseline for unsupervised labeling of vocal units (i.e. syllables) through manifold learning, by investigating how dimen- sionality reduction on mel-spectrograms affects labeling, and comparing it with unsupervised labels based on acoustic similarity. We then encoded vocalizations as syllabic sequences to analyze the type of syntax, and extracted the Maximal Repetitions (MRs) to evaluate syntactical structures. We found evidence for: i) associative syntax, rather than combinatorial (context classification is unaffected by permutation of sequences, F 1 > 0.9); ii) context-dependent use of syllables (Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, p-value < 0.05); iii) heavy-tail distribution of MRs (truncated power-law, exponent \u03b1 < 2), indicative of mechanism encoding com- binatorial complexity. Analysis of MRs and syllabic transition networks revealed that mother-pupil interactions were characterized by repetitions, while commu- nication in conflict-contexts exhibited higher complexity (longer MRs and more interconnected vocal sequences) than non-agonistic contexts. We propose that communicative complexity is higher in scenarios of disagreement, reflecting lower compressibility of information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u679c\u8760\u53eb\u58f0\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6027\u3001\u53e5\u6cd5\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u901a\u8baf\u6a21\u5f0f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u679c\u8760\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u7ea7\u53d1\u58f0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u52a8\u7269\u901a\u8baf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u53eb\u58f0\u7684\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u60c5\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6d41\u5f62\u5b66\u4e60\u6539\u8fdb\u97f3\u8282\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6885\u5c14\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u5c06\u53d1\u58f0\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u97f3\u8282\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u53e5\u6cd5\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b\u63d0\u53d6\u6700\u5927\u91cd\u590d\u5e8f\u5217\u8bc4\u4f30\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u97f3\u8282\u8f6c\u79fb\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u5173\u8054\u6027\u53e5\u6cd5\u800c\u975e\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u53e5\u6cd5\uff1b2) \u97f3\u8282\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u60c5\u5883\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff1b3) \u6700\u5927\u91cd\u590d\u5e8f\u5217\u5448\u73b0\u91cd\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7ec4\u5408\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff1b4) \u6bcd\u5a74\u4e92\u52a8\u4ee5\u91cd\u590d\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u51b2\u7a81\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u901a\u8baf\u6bd4\u975e\u5bf9\u6297\u60c5\u5883\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u3002", "conclusion": "\u679c\u8760\u901a\u8baf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5206\u6b67\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u7684\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u901a\u8baf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u538b\u529b\u76f8\u5173\u3002"}}

However, their performance degrades in photometrically ambiguous regions such as reflective and textureless surfaces, where unreliable cues disrupt photometric consistency and hinder accurate geometry estimation. Reflected light is often partially polarized in a manner that reveals surface orientation, making polarization an optic complement to photometric cues in resolving such ambiguities. Therefore, we propose PolarGS, an optics-aware extension of RGB-based 3DGS that leverages polarization as an optical prior to resolve photometric ambiguities and enhance reconstruction accuracy. Specifically, we introduce two complementary modules: a polarization-guided photometric correction strategy, which ensures photometric consistency by identifying reflective regions via the Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) and refining reflective Gaussians with Color Refinement Maps; and a polarization-enhanced Gaussian densification mechanism for textureless area geometry recovery, which integrates both Angle and Degree of Linear Polarization (A/DoLP) into a PatchMatch-based depth completion process. This enables the back-projection and fusion of new Gaussians, leading to more complete reconstruction.

I propose a research program to investigate this idea in silico by studying how collective self-models (coherent, self-referential representations) emerge from distributed learning systems embedded within universal self-organizing environments. The theory outlined here starts from the supposition that consciousness is an emergent property of collective intelligence systems undergoing synchronization of prediction through communication. It is not an epiphenomenon of individual modeling but a property of the language that a system evolves to internally describe itself. For a model of base reality, I begin with a minimal but general computational world: a cellular automaton, which exhibits both computational irreducibility and local reducibility. On top of this computational substrate, I introduce a network of local, predictive, representational (neural) models capable of communication and adaptation. I use this layered model to study how collective intelligence gives rise to self-representation as a direct consequence of inter-agent alignment. I suggest that consciousness does not emerge from modeling per se, but from communication. It arises from the noisy, lossy exchange of predictive messages between groups of local observers describing persistent patterns in the underlying computational substrate (base reality). It is through this representational dialogue that a shared model arises, aligning many partial views of the world.

Accurate PSF estimation is crucial for both optical characterization and computational vision, yet remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and the ill-posed nature of intensity-based deconvolution. We introduce CircleFlow, a high-fidelity PSF estimation framework that employs flow-guided edge localization for precise blur characterization. CircleFlow begins with a structured capture that encodes locally anisotropic and spatially varying PSFs by imaging a circle grid target, while leveraging the target's binary luminance prior to decouple image and kernel estimation. The latent sharp image is then reconstructed through subpixel alignment of an initialized binary structure guided by optical flow, whereas the PSF is modeled as an energy-constrained implicit neural representation. Both components are jointly optimized within a demosaicing-aware differentiable framework, ensuring physically consistent and robust PSF estimation enabled by accurate edge localization.

These grounded reports are easier to interpret, especially for non-experts. Existing MPG systems mostly follow the referring expression comprehension (REC) paradigm and return exactly one bounding box per phrase. Real reports often violate this assumption. They contain multi-region findings, non-diagnostic text, and non-groundable phrases, such as negations or descriptions of normal anatomy. Motivated by this, we reformulate the task as generalised medical phrase grounding (GMPG), where each sentence is mapped to zero, one, or multiple scored regions. To realise this formulation, we introduce the first GMPG model: MedGrounder. We adopted a two-stage training regime: pre-training on report sentence--anatomy box alignment datasets and fine-tuning on report sentence--human annotated box datasets. Experiments on PadChest-GR and MS-CXR show that MedGrounder achieves strong zero-shot transfer and outperforms REC-style and grounded report generation baselines on multi-region and non-groundable phrases, while using far fewer human box annotations. Finally, we show that MedGrounder can be composed with existing report generators to produce grounded reports without retraining the generator.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e7f\u4e49\u533b\u5b66\u77ed\u8bed\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08GMPG\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u548cMedGrounder\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u533b\u5b66\u77ed\u8bed\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53ea\u80fd\u8fd4\u56de\u5355\u4e2a\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u96f6\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u5206\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u77ed\u8bed\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\u9075\u5faa\u6307\u79f0\u8868\u8fbe\u7406\u89e3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u77ed\u8bed\u53ea\u80fd\u8fd4\u56de\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff0c\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u591a\u533a\u57df\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u975e\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u6587\u672c\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u77ed\u8bed\uff08\u5982\u5426\u5b9a\u6216\u6b63\u5e38\u89e3\u5256\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMedGrounder\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5148\u5728\u62a5\u544a\u53e5\u5b50-\u89e3\u5256\u6846\u5bf9\u9f50\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u62a5\u544a\u53e5\u5b50-\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6846\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u96f6\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u5206\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u5728PadChest-GR\u548cMS-CXR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMedGrounder\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u533a\u57df\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u77ed\u8bed\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eREC\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6846\u3002", "conclusion": "MedGrounder\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u5b9a\u4f4d\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While the emerging thinking-with-frames paradigm, which alternates between global temporal reasoning and local frame examination, has advanced the reasoning capabilities of video multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), it suffers from a significant efficiency bottleneck due to the progressively growing and redundant multi-modal context. To address this, we propose SpecTemp, a reinforcement learning-based Speculative Temporal reasoning framework that decouples temporal perception from reasoning via a cooperative dual-model design. In SpecTemp, a lightweight draft MLLM rapidly explores and proposes salient frames from densely sampled temporal regions, while a powerful target MLLM focuses on temporal reasoning and verifies the draft's proposals, iteratively refining its attention until convergence. This design mirrors the collaborative pathways of the human brain, balancing efficiency with accuracy. To support training, we construct the SpecTemp-80K dataset, featuring synchronized dual-level annotations for coarse evidence spans and fine-grained frame-level evidence. Experiments across multiple video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that SpecTemp not only maintains competitive accuracy but also significantly accelerates inference compared with existing thinking-with-frames methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpecTemp\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u6027\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u8026\u65f6\u5e8f\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\"thinking-with-frames\"\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5197\u4f59\u4e14\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u6027\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8349\u7a3fMLLM\uff08\u5feb\u901f\u63a2\u7d22\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u76ee\u6807MLLM\uff08\u4e13\u6ce8\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff09\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709thinking-with-frames\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406", "conclusion": "SpecTemp\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u8111\u534f\u4f5c\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u53cc\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def"}}

We propose the mode-conditioning (ModC) framework, which explicitly allocates test-time compute across reasoning modes using either specialist models or mode-specific prefixes. ModC consistently improves scaling across controlled graph-search tasks and large-scale reasoning benchmarks, spanning model families and sizes from 0.5B to 7B. On OpenThoughts, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B with ModC achieves a 4x efficiency gain over standard training while also improving the maximum attainable Pass@k.

Existing image restoration (IR) methods rely on pixel-level hard-fitting to ground-truth images, struggling with over-smoothing and poor generalization. To address these limitations, we propose IRPO, a low-level GRPO-based post-training paradigm that systematically explores both data formulation and reward modeling. We first explore a data formulation principle for low-level post-training paradigm, in which selecting underperforming samples from the pre-training stage yields optimal performance and improved efficiency. Furthermore, we model a reward-level criteria system that balances objective accuracy and human perceptual preference through three complementary components: a General Reward for structural fidelity, an Expert Reward leveraging Qwen-VL for perceptual alignment, and a Restoration Reward for task-specific low-level quality. Comprehensive experiments on six in-domain and five out-of-domain (OOD) low-level benchmarks demonstrate that IRPO achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse degradation types, surpassing the AdaIR baseline by 0.83 dB on in-domain tasks and 3.43 dB on OOD settings.

We hypothesize that this reliance on diffusive learning creates \"Catastrophic Rigidity\", rendering models unable to adapt to novel concepts without destroying their pre-trained reasoning capabilities. To isolate this phenomenon, we introduce Iterative Semantic Map Refinement (ISMR), a diagnostic protocol revealing that alignment is a fixed geometric barrier that scaling cannot solve; a 20-layer model overcomes this barrier no faster than a 1-layer model. We introduce the Phase-Resonant Intelligent Spectral Model (PRISM). PRISM encodes semantic identity as resonant frequencies in the complex domain (C^d) and replaces quadratic self-attention with linearithmic O(N log N) Gated Harmonic Convolutions. We validate PRISM on the WMT14 translation task. While the Standard Transformer maintains a slight edge in general competence on static benchmarks (23.88 vs 21.40 BLEU), it fails the \"Plasticity-Stability\" stress test completely. When injected with novel concepts, the Transformer suffers Catastrophic Forgetting, degrading by -10.55 BLEU points while achieving only 60% acquisition. In contrast, PRISM demonstrates Lossless Plasticity, achieving 96% 5-shot acquisition with negligible degradation (-0.84 BLEU).

However, existing methods lack explicit motion control and struggle to generate scenes with large and complex motions. We propose PanFlow, a novel approach that exploits the spherical nature of panoramas to decouple the highly dynamic camera rotation from the input optical flow condition, enabling more precise control over large and dynamic motions. We further introduce a spherical noise warping strategy to promote loop consistency in motion across panorama boundaries. To support effective training, we curate a large-scale, motion-rich panoramic video dataset with frame-level pose and flow annotations.

They are invariant primarily to texture and photorealistic detail. Composing such structures from fixed components under geometric constraints and vague goal specification (such as text) is non-trivial due to combinatorial placement choices, limited data, and discrete feasibility (overlap-free, allowable orientations), which create a sparse solution manifold ill-suited to purely statistical pixel-space generators. We propose a constraint-guided framework that combines explicit geometric reasoning with neural semantics. An AlphaGo-style search enforces feasibility, while a fine-tuned vision-language model scores semantic alignment as reward signals. Our algorithm uses a policy network as a heuristic in Monte-Carlo Tree Search and fine-tunes the network via search-generated plans. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network, we use the generated instances for adversarial reward refinement. Over time, the generation should approach the actual data more closely when the reward model cannot distinguish between generated instances and ground-truth. In the Tangram Assembly task, our approach yields higher validity and semantic fidelity than diffusion and auto-regressive baselines, especially as constraints tighten.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ea6\u675f\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7AlphaGo\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u5206\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u4e03\u5de7\u677f\u7ec4\u88c5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u62bd\u8c61\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\uff0c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u5143\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u5bf9\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\u4ece\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u7ec4\u5408\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff1a\u7ec4\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u591a\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff08\u65e0\u91cd\u53e0\u3001\u5141\u8bb8\u65b9\u5411\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a00\u758f\u89e3\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u7eaf\u7edf\u8ba1\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u7ea6\u675f\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u8bed\u4e49\u3002AlphaGo\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u5206\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u641c\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u5fae\u8c03\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u53d7GAN\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u5de7\u677f\u7ec4\u88c5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u6536\u7d27\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u62bd\u8c61\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec4\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

With the advent of visual language models (VLMs), GUI automation has progressed from generating text-based instructions for humans to autonomously executing tasks, thus optimizing automation workflows. Recent approaches leverage VLMs for this problem due to their ability to 1) process on-screen content directly, 2) remain independent of device-specific APIs by utilizing human actions (e.g., clicks, typing), and 3) apply real-world contextual knowledge for task understanding. However, these models often have trouble accurately identifying widgets and determining actions due to limited spatial information in vision encoder features. Additionally, top-performing models are often large, requiring extensive training and resulting in inference delays. In this work, we introduce AFRAgent, an instruct-BLIP-based multimodal architecture that achieves superior performance in GUI automation while being less than one-fourth the size of its nearest competitor. To enhance image embeddings in the large language model (LLM) pipeline, we propose an adaptive feature renormalization-based (a token-level affine transformation) technique that effectively enriches low-resolution image embeddings and fuses high-resolution details.

However, the actual capability of LLMs in JavaScript vulnerability detection remains questionable, necessitating systematic evaluation and comprehensive benchmarks. Unfortunately, existing benchmarks suffer from three critical limitations: (1) incomplete coverage, such as covering a limited subset of CWE types; (2) underestimation of LLM capabilities caused by unreasonable ground truth labeling; and (3) overestimation due to unrealistic cases such as using isolated vulnerable files rather than complete projects.\n  In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, three principles for constructing a benchmark for JavaScript vulnerability detection that directly address these limitations: (1) comprehensiveness, (2) no underestimation, and (3) no overestimation. Guided by these principles, we propose FORGEJS, the first automatic benchmark generation framework for evaluating LLMs' capability in JavaScript vulnerability detection. Then, we use FORGEJS to construct ARENAJS-the first systematic benchmark for LLM-based JavaScript vulnerability detection-and further propose JUDGEJS, an automatic evaluation framework.\n  We conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs for JavaScript vulnerability detection, leveraging JUDGEJS to assess seven popular commercial LLMs on ARENAJS. The results show that LLMs not only exhibit limited reasoning capabilities, but also suffer from severe robustness defects, indicating that reliable JavaScript vulnerability detection with LLMs remains an open challenge.", "AI": {"tldr": "FORGEJS\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684JavaScript\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6784\u5efa\uff1a\u5168\u9762\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u4f4e\u4f30\u3001\u4e0d\u9ad8\u4f30\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u521b\u5efa\u4e86ARENAJS\u57fa\u51c6\u548cJUDGEJS\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf97\u4e2a\u5546\u4e1aLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5b83\u4eec\u5728JavaScript\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709JavaScript\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a1) \u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff08\u4ec5\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650CWE\u7c7b\u578b\uff09\uff1b2) \u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u4f30LLM\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3) \u7531\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u5b64\u7acb\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6587\u4ef6\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u6574\u9879\u76ee\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u4f30LLM\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728JavaScript\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6784\u5efa\u539f\u5219\uff1a\u5168\u9762\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u4f4e\u4f30\u3001\u4e0d\u9ad8\u4f30\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u5219\u5f00\u53d1FORGEJS\u81ea\u52a8\u57fa\u51c6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u521b\u5efaARENAJS\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51faJUDGEJS\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf97\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u5546\u4e1aLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cLLM\u5728JavaScript\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u9650\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u7684JavaScript\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LLM\u5728JavaScript\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FORGEJS\u3001ARENAJS\u548cJUDGEJS\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u9760\u7684LLM\u8f85\u52a9JavaScript\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

In this study, we evaluate the robustness of JATMO against HOUYI, a genetic attack framework that systematically mutates and optimizes adversarial prompts. We adapt HOUYI by introducing custom fitness scoring, modified mutation logic, and a new harness for local model testing, enabling a more accurate assessment of defense effectiveness. We fine-tuned LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen1.5-4B, and Qwen1.5-0.5B models under the JATMO methodology and compared them with a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-Turbo baseline. Results show that while JATMO reduces attack success rates relative to instruction-tuned models, it does not fully prevent injections; adversaries exploiting multilingual cues or code-related disruptors still bypass defenses. We also observe a trade-off between generation quality and injection vulnerability, suggesting that better task performance often correlates with increased susceptibility.

This illustrates a need for a strong, task-agnostic foundation model that requires minimal fine-tuning beyond feature extraction. In this work, we introduce a suite of task-agnostic pretraining of CT foundation models (TAP-CT): a simple yet effective adaptation of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and DINOv2 for volumetric data, enabling scalable self-supervised pretraining directly on 3D CT volumes. Our approach incorporates targeted modifications to patch embeddings, positional encodings, and volumetric augmentations, making the architecture depth-aware while preserving the simplicity of the underlying architectures. We show that large-scale 3D pretraining on an extensive in-house CT dataset (105K volumes) yields stable, robust frozen representations that generalize strongly across downstream tasks.

However, our study unveils a critical, overlooked vulnerability: their profound susceptibility to subtle symbolic perturbations, particularly through near-imperceptible emoticon tokens such as \"(@_@)\" that can catastrophically mislead retrieval, termed EmoRAG. We demonstrate that injecting a single emoticon into a query makes it nearly 100% likely to retrieve semantically unrelated texts that contain a matching emoticon. Our extensive experiment across general question-answering and code domains, using a range of state-of-the-art retrievers and generators, reveals three key findings: (I) Single-Emoticon Disaster: Minimal emoticon injections cause maximal disruptions, with a single emoticon almost 100% dominating RAG output. (II) Positional Sensitivity: Placing an emoticon at the beginning of a query can cause severe perturbation, with F1-Scores exceeding 0.92 across all datasets. (III) Parameter-Scale Vulnerability: Counterintuitively, models with larger parameters exhibit greater vulnerability to the interference. We provide an in-depth analysis to uncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Furthermore, we raise a critical concern regarding the robustness assumption of current RAG systems, envisioning a threat scenario where an adversary exploits this vulnerability to manipulate the RAG system. We evaluate standard defenses and find them insufficient against EmoRAG. To address this, we propose targeted defenses, analyzing their strengths and limitations in mitigating emoticon-based perturbations. Finally, we outline future directions for building robust RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u7b49\u7ec6\u5fae\u7b26\u53f7\u6270\u52a8\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5355\u4e2a\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u5c31\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u7d22\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3aEmoRAG\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86LLM\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5b58\u5728\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff1a\u5bf9\u7ec6\u5fae\u7b26\u53f7\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u7d22\u88ab\u707e\u96be\u6027\u8bef\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u5355\u4e2a\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\uff08\u5982\"(@_@)\"\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u7528\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4f4d\u7f6e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a1\uff09\u5355\u4e2a\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u6ce8\u5165\u51e0\u4e4e100%\u4e3b\u5bfcRAG\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b2\uff09\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u5f00\u5934\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6270\u52a8\u6700\u4e25\u91cd\uff08F1\u5206\u6570\u8d85\u8fc70.92\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u800c\u66f4\u8106\u5f31\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u5bf9\u6b64\u65e0\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0cEmoRAG\u6f0f\u6d1e\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5229\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u5efa\u771f\u6b63\u9c81\u68d2\u7684RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Although multiple low-dose CBCT strategies have been introduced, none have undergone validation using large-scale multicenter retrospective datasets, and prospective clinical evaluation remains lacking. Here, we propose DeepPriorCBCT - a three-stage deep learning framework that achieves diagnostic-grade reconstruction using only one-sixth of the conventional radiation dose. 4102 patients with 8675 CBCT scans from 12 centers were included to develop and validate DeepPriorCBCT. Additionally, a prospective cross-over trial (Registry number: NCT07035977) which recruited 138 patients scheduled for percutaneous thoracic puncture was conducted to assess the model's clinical applicability. Assessment by 11 physicians confirmed that reconstructed images were indistinguishable from original scans. Moreover, diagnostic performance and overall image quality were comparable to those generated by standard reconstruction algorithms. In the prospective trial, five radiologists reported no significant differences in image quality or lesion assessment between DeepPriorCBCT and the clinical standard (all P>0.05). Likewise, 25 interventionalists expressed no preference between model-based and full-sampling images for surgical guidance (Kappa<0.2). Radiation exposure with DeepPriorCBCT was reduced to approximately one-sixth of that with the conventional approach, and collectively, the findings confirm that it enables high-quality CBCT reconstruction under sparse sampling conditions while markedly decreasing intraoperative radiation risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeepPriorCBCT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5e38\u89c4\u8f90\u5c04\u5242\u91cf\u7684\u516d\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bca\u65ad\u7ea7CBCT\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u672f\u4e2d\u8f90\u5c04\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "CBCT\u5f15\u5bfc\u7a7f\u523a\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u65e9\u671f\u81f3\u4e2d\u671f\u80f8\u90e8\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u6210\u719f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u8f90\u5c04\u66b4\u9732\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7ee7\u53d1\u6027\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCBCT\u7b56\u7565\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u56de\u987e\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e5f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDeepPriorCBCT\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece12\u4e2a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u76844102\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u76848675\u6b21CBCT\u626b\u63cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u4ea4\u53c9\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff08NCT07035977\uff09\uff0c\u62db\u52df138\u540d\u8ba1\u5212\u8fdb\u884c\u7ecf\u76ae\u80f8\u90e8\u7a7f\u523a\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "11\u540d\u533b\u751f\u8bc4\u4f30\u786e\u8ba4\u91cd\u5efa\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u626b\u63cf\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\uff1b\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u91cd\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c5\u540d\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u62a5\u544aDeepPriorCBCT\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6807\u51c6\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6216\u75c5\u53d8\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b25\u540d\u4ecb\u5165\u533b\u751f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u5efa\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5168\u91c7\u6837\u56fe\u50cf\u65e0\u504f\u597d\u3002\u8f90\u5c04\u66b4\u9732\u51cf\u5c11\u81f3\u5e38\u89c4\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ea6\u516d\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepPriorCBCT\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfCBCT\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u672f\u4e2d\u8f90\u5c04\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Prolonged training on such statistically optimal but cognitively impoverished data accelerates model collapse.\n  This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of imitating the surface properties of data, we simulate the cognitive processes that generate human text. We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators.\n  The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline. First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC > 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models. Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33.\n  Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faPMCSF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u4eff\u8868\u9762\u6570\u636e\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u529f\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u5316\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u79fb\u9664\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6a21\u4eff\u6570\u636e\u8868\u9762\u5c5e\u6027\u8f6c\u5411\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPrompt\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6(PMCSF)\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8ba4\u77e5\u72b6\u6001\u89e3\u7801\u5668(CSD)\u5c06\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u8f6c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8ba4\u77e5\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba4\u77e5\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668(CTE)\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6270\u52a8\u7b97\u5b50\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u65b0\u7269\u8d28\u5316\u4e3a\u5bcc\u542b\u4eba\u7c7b\u5178\u578b\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u6587\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u8ba4\u77e5\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1aCTE\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\u7684Jensen-Shannon\u6563\u5ea6\u4e3a0.0614\uff08\u6807\u51c6LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u4e3a0.4431\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u76f2\u4e13\u4e1a\u5a92\u4f53\u8bc4\u5ba1\uff0c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7ec4\u5185\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570ICC>0.9\u3002\u529f\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1aA\u80a1\u5e02\u573a\u540c\u6784\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5305\u542bCTE\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u57282015\u5e74\u5d29\u76d8\u671f\u95f4\u6700\u5927\u56de\u64a4\u51cf\u5c1147.4%\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f8.6%\u9632\u5fa1\u6027Alpha\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u672c33\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u9650\u5236\u800c\u975e\u590d\u5236\u8868\u9762\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u771f\u6b63\u529f\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3AI\u6570\u636e\u5d29\u6e83\u5371\u673a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, its substantial data size poses a major barrier to widespread adoption. While feed-forward 3DGS compression offers a practical alternative to costly per-scene per-train compressors, existing methods struggle to model long-range spatial dependencies, due to the limited receptive field of transform coding networks and the inadequate context capacity in entropy models. In this work, we propose a novel feed-forward 3DGS compression framework that effectively models long-range correlations to enable highly compact and generalizable 3D representations. Central to our approach is a large-scale context structure that comprises thousands of Gaussians based on Morton serialization. We then design a fine-grained space-channel auto-regressive entropy model to fully leverage this expansive context. Furthermore, we develop an attention-based transform coding model to extract informative latent priors by aggregating features from a wide range of neighboring Gaussians. Our method yields a $20\\times$ compression ratio for 3DGS in a feed-forward inference and achieves state-of-the-art performance among generalizable codecs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u524d\u9988\u5f0f3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7a7a\u95f4-\u901a\u9053\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u71b5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b020\u500d\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85(3DGS)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9769\u547d\u6027\u76843D\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u5e9e\u5927\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u524d\u9988\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u53d8\u6362\u7f16\u7801\u7f51\u7edc\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u6709\u9650\u548c\u71b5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "1) \u57fa\u4e8eMorton\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u9ad8\u65af\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7a7a\u95f4-\u901a\u9053\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u71b5\u6a21\u578b\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b3) \u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u5e7f\u6cdb\u90bb\u57df\u9ad8\u65af\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8620\u500d\u76843DGS\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u524d\u9988\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u901a\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u76843D\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863DGS\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5927\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Specifically, through a first-order approximation, we show that this surrogate becomes increasingly valid only when both the training-inference discrepancy and policy staleness are minimized. This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness. Notably, once training is stabilized, prolonged optimization consistently yields comparable final performance regardless of cold-start initialization.

This work introduces a quantum-inspired geometric framework for neural operators that represents each operator by its normalized singular value spectrum on the Bloch hypersphere. We prove a tight spectral-to-functional equivalence theorem showing that vanishing Fubini--Study/Wasserstein-2 distance implies provable functional closeness, establishing the first rigorous foundation for cross-modal and cross-architecture operator substitutability.

It is important for users to update their dependencies to safer versions, but many still use older, vulnerable package versions because upgrading can be difficult and may break their existing codebase. Software developers can mitigate this problem by backporting security patches to older releases. However, manually backporting is time-consuming and error-prone. The effectiveness of existing automated backporting techniques on general software remains unclear since they typically target only code-hunk or function-level patch porting scenarios and are evaluated with imperfect metrics.\n  To facilitate the development and evaluation of automated backporting techniques, we introduce BackportBench, the first comprehensive benchmark suite for patch backporting problem. BackportBench is a multilingual benchmark that contains 202 patch backporting problems from PyPI, Maven, and npm, each with executable Docker environments and relevant test cases. We evaluated existing patch porting methods and LLM-based techniques that have the potential to adapt to this task using BackportBench. The results show that the agentic method has outperformed traditional patch porting methods, especially on cases that require logical and structural changes. However, the performance varies across different programming languages.

Humans use real-time introspection to decide how much effort to invest, when to make multiple attempts, when to stop, and when to signal success or failure. Without this, LLMs struggle to make intelligent meta-cognition decisions. Test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N drive up cost and latency by using a fixed budget of samples regardless of the marginal benefit of each one at any point in generation, and the absence of confidence signals can mislead people, prevent appropriate escalation to better tools, and undermine trustworthiness. Learned verifiers or reward models can provide confidence estimates, but do not enable adaptive inference and add substantial cost by requiring extra models or forward passes. We present ZIP-RC, an adaptive inference method that equips models with zero-overhead inference-time predictions of reward and cost. At every token, ZIP-RC reuses reserved or unused logits in the same forward pass as next-token prediction to output a joint distribution over final reward and remaining length -- no extra models, architecture change, or inference overhead. This full joint distribution is used to compute a sampling utility which is the linear combination of the expected maximum reward, total compute, and latency of set of samples if generated to completion.

We introduce HanDyVQA, a fine-grained video question-answering benchmark that comprehensively covers both the manipulation and effect aspects of HOI. HanDyVQA comprises six complementary question types (Action, Process, Objects, Location, State Change, and Object Parts), totalling 11.1K multiple-choice QA pairs. Collected QA pairs recognizing manipulation styles, hand/object motions, and part-level state changes. HanDyVQA also includes 10.3K segmentation masks for Objects and Object Parts questions, enabling the evaluation of object/part-level reasoning in video object segmentation. We evaluated recent video foundation models on our benchmark and found that even the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, reached only 73% average accuracy, which is far from human performance (97%). Further analysis shows the remaining challenges in spatial relationship, motion, and part-level geometric understanding.

To address these limitations, we propose the first training-free multilingual approach, based on retrieval-augmented prompting. For a given aerial image, we employ a domain-adapted SigLIP2 encoder to retrieve related captions and few-shot examples from a datastore, which are then provided to a language model. We explore two variants: an image-blind setup, where a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) generates the caption from textual prompts alone, and an image-aware setup, where a Vision--Language Model (VLM) jointly processes the prompt and the input image. To improve the coherence of the retrieved content, we introduce a graph-based re-ranking strategy using PageRank on a graph of images and captions. Experiments on four benchmark datasets across ten languages demonstrate that our approach is competitive with fully supervised English-only systems and generalizes to other languages. Results also highlight the importance of re-ranking with PageRank, yielding up to 35% improvements in performance metrics. Additionally, it was observed that while VLMs tend to generate visually grounded but lexically diverse captions, LLMs can achieve stronger BLEU and CIDEr scores. Lastly, directly generating captions in the target language consistently outperforms other translation-based strategies.

We address this issue through the lens of false discovery rate (FDR) control, ensuring that among all accepted predictions, the proportion of errors does not exceed a target risk level. To achieve this in a principled way, we propose LEC, which reinterprets selective prediction as a constrained decision problem by enforcing a Linear Expectation Constraint over selection and error indicators. Then, we establish a finite-sample sufficient condition, which relies only on a held-out set of exchangeable calibration samples, to compute an FDR-constrained, coverage-maximizing threshold. Furthermore, we extend LEC to a two-model routing mechanism: given a prompt, if the current model's uncertainty exceeds its calibrated threshold, we delegate it to a stronger model, while maintaining a unified FDR guarantee. Evaluations on closed-ended and open-ended question-answering (QA) datasets show that LEC achieves tighter FDR control and substantially improves sample retention over prior methods.

In streaming video scenarios, the primary bottleneck lies in the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoding stage, where redundant processing of temporally similar frames leads to inefficiency. Additionally, inflated token sequences during LLM pre-filling further exacerbate latency and memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{S}treaming \\textbf{T}oken \\textbf{C}ompression (\\textbf{STC}), a plug-and-play hierarchical framework that seamlessly integrates into existing streaming VideoLLMs, optimizing both ViT encoding and LLM pre-filling stages to accelerate processing. STC introduces two token-level accelerators: \\textbf{STC-Cacher}, which reduces ViT encoding overhead by caching and reusing features from temporally similar frames, and \\textbf{STC-Pruner}, which compresses the visual token sequence before it enters the LLM, preserving only the most salient tokens based on both spatial and temporal relevance. Extensive experiments on four baseline streaming VideoLLMs across five benchmarks demonstrate that STC outperforms other compression methods.

Existing hallucination detectors rely on semantic similarity metrics that tolerate entity substitutions, a dangerous failure mode when confusing parties, dates, or legal provisions can have material consequences. We introduce HalluGraph, a graph-theoretic framework that quantifies hallucinations through structural alignment between knowledge graphs extracted from context, query, and response.

To mitigate this issue, using a lightweight VLM has been explored, but it compromises spatiotemporal reasoning. Although some methods suggest that incorporating additional 3D inputs can help, they usually rely on large VLMs to fuse 3D and 2D inputs and still lack temporal understanding. Therefore, we propose SwiftVLA, an architecture that enhances a compact model with 4D understanding while preserving design efficiency. Specifically, our approach features a pretrained 4D visual geometry transformer with a temporal cache that extracts 4D features from 2D images. Then, to enhance the VLM's ability to exploit both 2D images and 4D features, we introduce Fusion Tokens, a set of learnable tokens trained with a future prediction objective to generate unified representations for action generation. Finally, we introduce a mask-and-reconstruct strategy that masks 4D inputs to the VLM and trains the VLA to reconstruct them, enabling the VLM to learn effective 4D representations and allowing the 4D branch to be dropped at inference with minimal performance loss. Experiments in real and simulated environments show that SwiftVLA outperforms lightweight baselines and rivals VLAs up to 7 times larger, achieving comparable performance on edge devices while being 18 times faster and reducing memory footprint by 12 times.", "AI": {"tldr": "SwiftVLA \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u51654D\u89c6\u89c9\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u548c\u878d\u5408\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7d27\u51d1\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u53c8\u727a\u7272\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u52a0\u51653D\u8f93\u5165\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76844D\u89c6\u89c9\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4ece2D\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u53d64D\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u878d\u5408\u4ee4\u724c\u901a\u8fc7\u672a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u751f\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u5efa\u88ab\u63a9\u7801\u76844D\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cSwiftVLA\u8d85\u8d8a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf7\u500d\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534718\u500d\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u51cf\u5c1112\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "SwiftVLA\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u76844D\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684VLA\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While prior streaming benchmarks evaluate temporal reasoning, none measure whether MLLMs can interpret or leverage human gaze signals within a streaming setting. To fill this gap, we introduce StreamGaze, the first benchmark designed to evaluate how effectively MLLMs use gaze for temporal and proactive reasoning in streaming videos. StreamGaze introduces gaze-guided past, present, and proactive tasks that comprehensively evaluate streaming video understanding. These tasks assess whether models can use real-time gaze to follow shifting attention and infer user intentions from only past and currently observed frames. To build StreamGaze, we develop a gaze-video QA generation pipeline that aligns egocentric videos with raw gaze trajectories via fixation extraction, region-specific visual prompting, and scanpath construction. This pipeline produces spatio-temporally grounded QA pairs that closely reflect human perceptual dynamics. Across all StreamGaze tasks, we observe substantial performance gaps between state-of-the-art MLLMs and human performance, revealing fundamental limitations in gaze-based temporal reasoning, intention modeling, and proactive prediction. We further provide detailed analyses of gaze-prompting strategies, reasoning behaviors, and task-specific failure modes, offering deeper insight into why current MLLMs struggle and what capabilities future models must develop.

Recent studies utilize nouns as external semantic knowledge to improve clus- tering performance. However, these methods often overlook the inherent ambiguity of nouns, which can distort semantic representations and degrade clustering quality. To address this issue, we propose a hierarChical semAntic alignmEnt method for image clustering, dubbed CAE, which improves cluster- ing performance in a training-free manner. In our approach, we incorporate two complementary types of textual seman- tics: caption-level descriptions, which convey fine-grained attributes of image content, and noun-level concepts, which represent high-level object categories. We first select relevant nouns from WordNet and descriptions from caption datasets to construct a semantic space aligned with image features. Then, we align image features with selected nouns and captions via optimal transport to obtain a more discriminative semantic space. Finally, we combine the enhanced semantic and image features to perform clustering.

While prior work has examined hallucinations from macroscopic perspectives such as training data and objectives, the underlying neuron-level mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins. Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remarkably sparse subset of neurons (less than $0.1\\%$ of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios. In terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors. Concerning their origins, we trace these neurons back to the pre-trained base models and find that these neurons remain predictive for hallucination detection, indicating they emerge during pre-training.

Nevertheless, generating temporally coherent long-form content remains challenging. Existing approaches are constrained by computational and memory limitations, as they are typically trained on short video segments, thus performing effectively only over limited frame lengths and hindering their potential for extended coherent generation. To address these constraints, we propose TalkingPose, a novel diffusion-based framework specifically designed for producing long-form, temporally consistent human upper-body animations. TalkingPose leverages driving frames to precisely capture expressive facial and hand movements, transferring these seamlessly to a target actor through a stable diffusion backbone. To ensure continuous motion and enhance temporal coherence, we introduce a feedback-driven mechanism built upon image-based diffusion models. Notably, this mechanism does not incur additional computational costs or require secondary training stages, enabling the generation of animations with unlimited duration.

While instructions serve as the primary protocol for defining agents, RLVR typically relies on static and manually designed instructions. However, those instructions may be suboptimal for the base model, and the optimal instruction may change as the agent's policy improves and explores the interaction with the environment. To bridge the gap, we introduce INSPO, a novel Instruction-Policy co-evolution framework that integrates instruction optimization as a dynamic component of the reinforcement learning (RL) loop. INSPO maintains a dynamic population of instruction candidates that are sampled with questions, where reward signals in RL loops are automatically attributed to each instruction, and low performers are periodically pruned.

However, non-upright panoramas due to unstable robot postures hinder downstream tasks. Traditional IMU-based correction methods suffer from drift and external disturbances, while vision-based approaches offer a promising alternative. This study presents a dual-stream angle-aware generation network that jointly estimates camera inclination angles and reconstructs upright panoramic images. The network comprises a CNN branch that extracts local geometric structures from equirectangular projections and a ViT branch that captures global contextual cues from cubemap projections. These are integrated through a dual-projection adaptive fusion module that aligns spatial features across both domains. To further enhance performance, we introduce a high-frequency enhancement block, circular padding, and channel attention mechanisms to preserve 360\u00b0 continuity and improve geometric sensitivity. Experiments on the SUN360 and M3D datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both inclination estimation and upright panorama generation.

Code and data will be available at https://github.com/sitaocheng/from_atomic_to_composite", "summary": "The mechanism by which RL contributes to reasoning capabilities-whether it incentivizes the synthesis of new skills or merely amplifies existing behaviors-remains a subject of intense debate. In this work, we investigate this question through the lens of Complementary Reasoning, a complex task that requires integrating internal parametric knowledge with external contextual information. Using a controlled synthetic dataset of human biographies, we strictly decouple this ability into two atomic skills: Parametric Reasoning (relying on internal knowledge) and Contextual Reasoning (depending on external information). To rigorously assess capability boundaries, we evaluate generalization across three distinct levels of difficulty: I.I.D., Composition, and Zero-shot settings. We find that while SFT is sufficient for in-distribution performance, it struggles with O.O.D. generalization, particularly in Zero-shot settings where relational combinations are novel. Crucially, we identify the SFT Generalization Paradox: Models supervised solely on the composite task achieve near-perfect in-distribution accuracy but collapse on out-of-distribution generalization, indicating their reliance on rote memorization of path shortcuts. In contrast, we find that RL acts as a reasoning synthesizer rather than a probability amplifier. However, we uncover a strict atomic prerequisite: RL can only synthesize these complex strategies if the base model has first mastered the independent atomic skills (Parametric and Contextual) via SFT. These findings challenge the view of RL as a mere amplifier, suggesting that given sufficient atomic foundations, RL can actively synthesize complex reasoning strategies from learned primitives without explicit supervision on such complex strategies. This indicates that decoupled atomic training followed by RL offers a scalable path to generalization for complex reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "RL\u80fd\u5408\u6210\u65b0\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u653e\u5927\u73b0\u6709\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u524d\u63d0\u662f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5148\u901a\u8fc7SFT\u638c\u63e1\u539f\u5b50\u6280\u80fd", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76RL\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u662f\u5408\u6210\u65b0\u6280\u80fd\u8fd8\u662f\u4ec5\u653e\u5927\u73b0\u6709\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u8865\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7814\u7a76\u6b64\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f20\u8bb0\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e92\u8865\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4e24\u4e2a\u539f\u5b50\u6280\u80fd\u3002\u5728I.I.D.\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4e09\u4e2a\u96be\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4SFT\u548cRL\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0SFT\u6cdb\u5316\u6096\u8bba\uff1a\u4ec5\u76d1\u7763\u590d\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4f46\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u5d29\u6e83\u3002RL\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u5408\u6210\u5668\u800c\u975e\u6982\u7387\u653e\u5927\u5668\uff0c\u4f46\u524d\u63d0\u662f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5148\u901a\u8fc7SFT\u638c\u63e1\u72ec\u7acb\u539f\u5b50\u6280\u80fd", "conclusion": "RL\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u539f\u5b50\u57fa\u7840\u4e0b\u80fd\u4e3b\u52a8\u4ece\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u539f\u8bed\u5408\u6210\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\u3002\u89e3\u8026\u539f\u5b50\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u63a5RL\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8def\u5f84"}}

We curated a scientifically rigorous dataset comprising 97 micro-CT scanned specimens across 27 species, selecting 12 species with sufficient representation for robust machine learning. To ensure methodological integrity and prevent data leakage, we employed specimen-level data splitting, resulting in 109,617 high-quality 2D slices (44,103 for training, 14,046 for validation, and 51,468 for testing). We evaluated seven state-of-the-art 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures using transfer learning. Our final ensemble model, combining ConvNeXt-Large and EfficientNetV2-Small, achieved a test accuracy of 95.64%, with a top-3 accuracy of 99.6% and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.998 across all species. To facilitate practical deployment, we developed an interactive advanced dashboard that supports real-time slice classification and 3D slice matching using advanced similarity metrics, including SSIM, NCC, and the Dice coefficient.

We present Chain of Ground CoG a training free multi step grounding framework that uses multimodal large language models for iterative visual reasoning and refinement. Instead of direct prediction the model progressively reflects and adjusts its hypotheses leading to more accurate and interpretable localization. Our approach achieves 68.4 accuracy on the ScreenSpot Pro benchmark an improvement of 4.8 points. To measure real world generalization we introduce TPanel UI a dataset of 420 labeled industrial control panels with visual distortions such as blur and masking. On TPanel UI Chain of Ground improves over the strong baseline Qwen3 VL 235B by 6.9 points showing the effectiveness of multi step training free grounding across real world and digital interfaces.

However, a reasonable and broader receptive field is essential for enhancing feature distinctiveness. In this paper, we propose a Local Attentive Hashing Network for point cloud registration, called LAHNet, which introduces a local attention mechanism with the inductive bias of locality of convolution-like operators into point cloud descriptors. Specifically, a Group Transformer is designed to capture reasonable long-range context between points. This employs a linear neighborhood search strategy, Locality-Sensitive Hashing, enabling uniformly partitioning point clouds into non-overlapping windows. Meanwhile, an efficient cross-window strategy is adopted to further expand the reasonable feature receptive field. Furthermore, building on this effective windowing strategy, we propose an Interaction Transformer to enhance the feature interactions of the overlap regions within point cloud pairs. This computes an overlap matrix to match overlap regions between point cloud pairs by representing each window as a global signal. Extensive results demonstrate that LAHNet can learn robust and distinctive features, achieving significant registration results on real-world indoor and outdoor benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "LAHNet\u63d0\u51fa\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u54c8\u5e0c\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u54c8\u5e0c\u5206\u533a\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u70b9\u4e91\u7279\u5f81\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5408\u7406\u7684\u66f4\u5927\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u5bf9\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u83b7\u5408\u7406\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLAHNet\u7f51\u7edc\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528Group Transformer\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u654f\u611f\u54c8\u5e0c\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u5747\u5300\u5206\u533a\u5230\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u7a97\u53e3\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1Interaction Transformer\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u53e0\u77e9\u9635\u5339\u914d\u70b9\u4e91\u5bf9\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLAHNet\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "LAHNet\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7a97\u53e3\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u70b9\u4e91\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

We rank over 50 open and closed source models by playing against a random opponent using a range of behavioral metrics, including win and loss rates, move quality, move legality, hallucinated actions, and game duration. For a subset of top reasoning models, we derive an Elo estimate by playing against a chess engine with variably configured skill, which allows for comparisons between models in an easily understandable way. Despite the simplicity of the instruction-following task and the weakness of the opponent, many state-of-the-art models struggle to complete games or achieve consistent wins. Similar to other benchmarks on complex reasoning tasks, our experiments reveal a clear separation between reasoning and non-reasoning models. However, unlike existing static benchmarks, the stochastic and dynamic nature of LLM CHESS uniquely reduces overfitting and memorization while preventing benchmark saturation, proving difficult even for top reasoning models.

While standard phrase grounding methods excel at localizing single objects, they lack the structural inductive bias to parse intricate relational descriptions, often failing as queries become more descriptive. To address this structural deficit, we focus on scene-graph grounding, a powerful but less-explored formulation where the query is an explicit graph of objects and their relationships. However, existing methods for this task also struggle, paradoxically showing decreased performance as the query graph grows -- failing to leverage the very information that should make grounding easier. We introduce SceneProp, a novel method that resolves this issue by reformulating scene-graph grounding as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference problem in a Markov Random Field (MRF). By performing global inference over the entire query graph, SceneProp finds the optimal assignment of image regions to nodes that jointly satisfies all constraints. This is achieved within an end-to-end framework via a differentiable implementation of the Belief Propagation algorithm. Experiments on four benchmarks show that our dedicated focus on the scene-graph grounding formulation allows SceneProp to significantly outperform prior work. Critically, its accuracy consistently improves with the size and complexity of the query graph, demonstrating for the first time that more relational context can, and should, lead to better grounding.

However, existing 3D-GS-based segmentation methods typically rely on high-dimensional category features, which introduce substantial memory overhead. Moreover, fine-grained segmentation remains challenging due to label space congestion and the lack of stable multi-granularity control mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose a coarse-to-fine binary encoding scheme for per-Gaussian category representation, which compresses each feature into a single integer via the binary-to-decimal mapping, drastically reducing memory usage. We further design a progressive training strategy that decomposes panoptic segmentation into a series of independent sub-tasks, reducing inter-class conflicts and thereby enhancing fine-grained segmentation capability. Additionally, we fine-tune opacity during segmentation training to address the incompatibility between photometric rendering and semantic segmentation, which often leads to foreground-background confusion.

Traditional methods often employ pre-trained models that struggle with fine-grained information and deterministic reasoning, leading to difficulties in aligning with complex or ambiguous moments. To overcome these limitations, we explore Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to construct a vanilla Evidential baseline. However, this approach encounters two major issues: the inability to effectively handle modality imbalance and the structural differences in DER's heuristic uncertainty regularizer, which adversely affect uncertainty estimation. This misalignment results in high uncertainty being incorrectly associated with accurate samples rather than challenging ones. Our observations indicate that existing methods lack the adaptability required for complex video scenarios. In response, we propose Debiased Evidential Learning for Moment Retrieval (DEMR), a novel framework that incorporates a Reflective Flipped Fusion (RFF) block for cross-modal alignment and a query reconstruction task to enhance text sensitivity, thereby reducing bias in uncertainty estimation. Additionally, we introduce a Geom-regularizer to refine uncertainty predictions, enabling adaptive alignment with difficult moments and improving retrieval accuracy. Extensive testing on standard datasets and debiased datasets ActivityNet-CD and Charades-CD demonstrates significant enhancements in effectiveness, robustness, and interpretability, positioning our approach as a promising solution for temporal-semantic robustness in moment retrieval.

Monocular internet videos offer a nearly limitless and readily available source of data, capturing an unparalleled diversity of human activities, objects, and environments. However, accurately and scalably extracting 4D interaction data from these in-the-wild videos remains a significant and unsolved challenge. Thus, in this work, we introduce 4DHOISolver, a novel and efficient optimization framework that constrains the ill-posed 4D HOI reconstruction problem by leveraging sparse, human-in-the-loop contact point annotations, while maintaining high spatio-temporal coherence and physical plausibility. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Open4DHOI, a new large-scale 4D HOI dataset featuring a diverse catalog of 144 object types and 103 actions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our reconstructions by enabling an RL-based agent to imitate the recovered motions. However, a comprehensive benchmark of existing 3D foundation models indicates that automatically predicting precise human-object contact correspondences remains an unsolved problem, underscoring the immediate necessity of our human-in-the-loop strategy while posing an open challenge to the community.

To provide composition guidance, we introduce PhotoFramer, a multi-modal composition instruction framework. Given a poorly composed image, PhotoFramer first describes how to improve the composition in natural language and then generates a well-composed example image. To train such a model, we curate a large-scale dataset. Inspired by how humans take photos, we organize composition guidance into a hierarchy of sub-tasks: shift, zoom-in, and view-change tasks. Shift and zoom-in data are sampled from existing cropping datasets, while view-change data are obtained via a two-stage pipeline. First, we sample pairs with varying viewpoints from multi-view datasets, and train a degradation model to transform well-composed photos into poorly composed ones. Second, we apply this degradation model to expert-taken photos to synthesize poor images to form training pairs. Using this dataset, we finetune a model that jointly processes and generates both text and images, enabling actionable textual guidance with illustrative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that textual instructions effectively steer image composition, and coupling them with exemplars yields consistent improvements over exemplar-only baselines. PhotoFramer offers a practical step toward composition assistants that make expert photographic priors accessible to everyday users.

To address these challenges, we propose S2AM3D, which incorporates 2D segmentation priors with 3D consistent supervision. We design a point-consistent part encoder that aggregates multi-view 2D features through native 3D contrastive learning, producing globally consistent point features. A scale-aware prompt decoder is then proposed to enable real-time adjustment of segmentation granularity via continuous scale signals. Simultaneously, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality part-level point cloud dataset with more than 100k samples, providing ample supervision signals for model training.

We present LISA-3D, a two-stage framework that lifts language-image segmentation into 3D by retrofitting the instruction-following model LISA with geometry-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers and reusing a frozen SAM-3D reconstructor. During training we exploit off-the-shelf RGB-D sequences and their camera poses to build a differentiable reprojection loss that enforces cross-view agreement without requiring any additional 3D-text supervision. The resulting masks are concatenated with RGB images to form RGBA prompts for SAM-3D, which outputs Gaussian splats or textured meshes without retraining. Across ScanRefer and Nr3D, LISA-3D improves language-to-3D accuracy by up to +15.6 points over single-view baselines while adapting only 11.6M parameters.

Project page: https://lotus-2.github.io/. 15 Pages, 12 Figures, 3 Tables", "summary": "Recovering pixel-wise geometric properties from a single image is fundamentally ill-posed due to appearance ambiguity and non-injective mappings between 2D observations and 3D structures. While discriminative regression models achieve strong performance through large-scale supervision, their success is bounded by the scale, quality and diversity of available data and limited physical reasoning. Recent diffusion models exhibit powerful world priors that encode geometry and semantics learned from massive image-text data, yet directly reusing their stochastic generative formulation is suboptimal for deterministic geometric inference: the former is optimized for diverse and high-fidelity image generation, whereas the latter requires stable and accurate predictions. In this work, we propose Lotus-2, a two-stage deterministic framework for stable, accurate and fine-grained geometric dense prediction, aiming to provide an optimal adaption protocol to fully exploit the pre-trained generative priors. Specifically, in the first stage, the core predictor employs a single-step deterministic formulation with a clean-data objective and a lightweight local continuity module (LCM) to generate globally coherent structures without grid artifacts. In the second stage, the detail sharpener performs a constrained multi-step rectified-flow refinement within the manifold defined by the core predictor, enhancing fine-grained geometry through noise-free deterministic flow matching. Using only 59K training samples, less than 1% of existing large-scale datasets, Lotus-2 establishes new state-of-the-art results in monocular depth estimation and highly competitive surface normal prediction. These results demonstrate that diffusion models can serve as deterministic world priors, enabling high-quality geometric reasoning beyond traditional discriminative and generative paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Lotus-2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b65\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u591a\u6b65\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8868\u9762\u6cd5\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u51e0\u4f55\u5c5e\u6027\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u75c5\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u516c\u5f0f\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u6838\u5fc3\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u6b65\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5c40\u90e8\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2) \u7ec6\u8282\u9510\u5316\u5668\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u5185\u6267\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\u591a\u6b65\u6821\u6b63\u6d41\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u589e\u5f3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u51e0\u4f55\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752859K\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff08\u4e0d\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76841%\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u9762\u6cd5\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e16\u754c\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u3002Lotus-2\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u534f\u8bae\u6765\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u3002"}}

However, recent works have suggested that when making predictions, VLMs may rely on static feature biases, such as background or object features, rather than dynamic visual changes. Static feature biases are a type of shortcut and can contribute to systematic prediction errors on downstream tasks; as a result, identifying and characterizing error-inducing static feature biases is critical prior to real-world model deployment. In this work, we introduce TRoVe, an automated approach for discovering error-inducing static feature biases learned by temporal VLMs. Given a trained VLM and an annotated validation dataset associated with a downstream classification task, TRoVe extracts candidate static features from the dataset and scores each feature by (i) the effect of the feature on classification errors as well as (ii) the extent to which the VLM relies on the feature when making predictions. In order to quantitatively evaluate TRoVe, we introduce an evaluation framework consisting of 101 trained temporal VLMs paired with ground-truth annotations for learned static feature biases. We use this framework to demonstrate that TRoVe can accurately identify error-inducing static feature biases in VLMs, achieving a 28.6% improvement over the closest baseline. Finally, we apply TRoVe to 7 off-the-shelf VLMs and 2 temporal understanding tasks, surfacing previously-unknown static feature biases and demonstrating that knowledge of learned biases can aid in improving model performance at test time.

Focusing on ViT-B/16 trained on ImageNet-1K, we study two simple parameter-reduction strategies applied to the MLP blocks, each removing 32.7\\% of the baseline parameters. Our \\emph{GroupedMLP} variant shares MLP weights between adjacent transformer blocks and achieves 81.47\\% top-1 accuracy while maintaining the baseline computational cost. Our \\emph{ShallowMLP} variant halves the MLP hidden dimension and reaches 81.25\\% top-1 accuracy with a 38\\% increase in inference throughput. Both models outperform the 86.6M-parameter baseline (81.05\\%) and exhibit substantially improved training stability, reducing peak-to-final accuracy degradation from 0.47\\% to the range 0.03\\% to 0.06\\%. These results suggest that, for ViT-B/16 on ImageNet-1K with a standard training recipe, the model operates in an overparameterized regime in which MLP capacity can be reduced without harming performance and can even slightly improve it. More broadly, our findings suggest that architectural constraints such as parameter sharing and reduced width may act as useful inductive biases, and highlight the importance of how parameters are allocated when designing Vision Transformers.

However, they need many sampling steps to create high-quality generations, resulting in slow inference speed. In this work, we propose Speed-RL, a novel paradigm for accelerating a pretrained MGMs to generate high-quality images in fewer steps. Unlike conventional distillation methods which formulate the acceleration problem as a distribution matching problem, where a few-step student model is trained to match the distribution generated by a many-step teacher model, we consider this problem as a reinforcement learning problem. Since the goal of acceleration is to generate high quality images in fewer steps, we can combine a quality reward with a speed reward and finetune the base model using reinforcement learning with the combined reward as the optimization target.

CycliST captures fundamental aspects of real-world processes by generating synthetic, richly structured video sequences featuring periodic patterns in object motion and visual attributes. CycliST employs a tiered evaluation system that progressively increases difficulty through variations in the number of cyclic objects, scene clutter, and lighting conditions, challenging state-of-the-art models on their spatio-temporal cognition. We conduct extensive experiments with current state-of-the-art VLMs, both open-source and proprietary, and reveal their limitations in generalizing to cyclical dynamics such as linear and orbital motion, as well as time-dependent changes in visual attributes like color and scale. Our results demonstrate that present-day VLMs struggle to reliably detect and exploit cyclic patterns, lack a notion of temporal understanding, and are unable to extract quantitative insights from scenes, such as the number of objects in motion, highlighting a significant technical gap that needs to be addressed. More specifically, we find no single model consistently leads in performance: neither size nor architecture correlates strongly with outcomes, and no model succeeds equally well across all tasks.

Grounded in optimal-approximation theory, we train a network to decompose an implicit approximation operator by minimizing the reconstruction error in the learned basis over a chosen distribution of probe functions. For suitable distributions, they can be seen as an approximation of the Laplacian operator and its eigendecomposition, which are fundamental in geometry processing. Furthermore, our method recovers in a unified manner not only the spectral basis, but also the implicit metric's sampling density and the eigenvalues of the underlying operator. Notably, our unsupervised method makes no assumption on the data manifold, such as meshing or manifold dimensionality, allowing it to scale to arbitrary datasets of any dimension. On point clouds lying on surfaces in 3D and high-dimensional image manifolds, our approach yields meaningful spectral bases, that can resemble those of the Laplacian, without explicit construction of an operator. By replacing the traditional operator selection, construction, and eigendecomposition with a learning-based approach, our framework offers a principled, data-driven alternative to conventional pipelines.

However, current approaches often struggle to model intra- and inter-modal interactions efficiently and effectively due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the inputs. A major challenge is capturing critical prognostic events that, though few, underlie the complexity of the observed inputs and largely determine patient outcomes. These events, manifested as high-level structural signals such as spatial histologic patterns or pathway co-activations, are typically sparse, patient-specific, and unannotated, making them inherently difficult to uncover. To address this, we propose SlotSPE, a slot-based framework for structural prognostic event modeling. Specifically, inspired by the principle of factorial coding, we compress each patient's multimodal inputs into compact, modality-specific sets of mutually distinctive slots using slot attention. By leveraging these slot representations as encodings for prognostic events, our framework enables both efficient and effective modeling of complex intra- and inter-modal interactions, while also facilitating seamless incorporation of biological priors that enhance prognostic relevance. Extensive experiments on ten cancer benchmarks show that SlotSPE outperforms existing methods in 8 out of 10 cohorts, achieving an overall improvement of 2.9%.

Current approaches typically employ task-specific models with independent architectures, leading to computational redundancy and ignoring potential correlations across related tasks. We introduce OmniFD, a unified framework that jointly addresses four core face forgery detection tasks within a single model, i.e., image and video classification, spatial localization, and temporal localization. Our architecture consists of three principal components: (1) a shared Swin Transformer encoder that extracts unified 4D spatiotemporal representations from both images and video inputs, (2) a cross-task interaction module with learnable queries that dynamically captures inter-task dependencies through attention-based reasoning, and (3) lightweight decoding heads that transform refined representations into corresponding predictions for all FFD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate OmniFD's advantage over task-specific models. Its unified design leverages multi-task learning to capture generalized representations across tasks, especially enabling fine-grained knowledge transfer that facilitates other tasks. For example, video classification accuracy improves by 4.63% when image data are incorporated. Furthermore, by unifying images, videos and the four tasks within one framework, OmniFD achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks with high efficiency and scalability, e.g., reducing 63% model parameters and 50% training time. It establishes a practical and generalizable solution for comprehensive face forgery detection in real-world applications.

While most prior work focuses on classifying discrete micro-expression categories, far fewer studies address the continuous evolution of intensity over time. Progress in this direction is limited by the lack of frame-level intensity labels, which makes fully supervised regression impractical.\n  We propose a unified framework for continuous micro-expression intensity estimation using only weak temporal labels (onset, apex, offset). A simple triangular prior converts sparse temporal landmarks into dense pseudo-intensity trajectories, and a lightweight temporal regression model that combines a ResNet18 encoder with a bidirectional GRU predicts frame-wise intensity directly from image sequences. The method requires no frame-level annotation effort and is applied consistently across datasets through a single preprocessing and temporal alignment pipeline.\n  Experiments on SAMM and CASME II show strong temporal agreement with the pseudo-intensity trajectories. On SAMM, the model reaches a Spearman correlation of 0.9014 and a Kendall correlation of 0.7999, outperforming a frame-wise baseline. On CASME II, it achieves up to 0.9116 and 0.8168, respectively, when trained without the apex-ranking term. Ablation studies confirm that temporal modeling and structured pseudo labels are central to capturing the rise-apex-fall dynamics of micro-facial movements.\n  To our knowledge, this is the first unified approach for continuous micro-expression intensity estimation using only sparse temporal annotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u65f6\u95f4\u6807\u6ce8\uff08\u8d77\u59cb\u70b9\u3001\u9876\u70b9\u3001\u7ed3\u675f\u70b9\uff09\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5fae\u8868\u60c5\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u89d2\u5148\u9a8c\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ResNet18\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u53cc\u5411GRU\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u5e8f\u56de\u5f52\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u79bb\u6563\u5fae\u8868\u60c5\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u800c\u8fde\u7eed\u5f3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u5e8f\u6f14\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5e27\u7ea7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5f31\u65f6\u95f4\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u4e09\u89d2\u5148\u9a8c\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u65f6\u95f4\u5730\u6807\uff08\u8d77\u59cb\u70b9\u3001\u9876\u70b9\u3001\u7ed3\u675f\u70b9\uff09\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u4f2a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u5e8f\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08ResNet18\u7f16\u7801\u5668+\u53cc\u5411GRU\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u5e27\u7ea7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u65e0\u9700\u5e27\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728SAMM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230Spearman\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u65700.9014\u548cKendall\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u65700.7999\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e27\u7ea7\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5728CASME II\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u52300.9116\u548c0.8168\uff08\u65e0\u9876\u70b9\u6392\u5e8f\u9879\u65f6\uff09\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5bf9\u6355\u6349\u5fae\u8868\u60c5\u4e0a\u5347-\u9876\u70b9-\u4e0b\u964d\u52a8\u6001\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u65f6\u95f4\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5fae\u8868\u60c5\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u5fae\u8868\u60c5\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u6f14\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While powerful pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable general capabilities, they surprisingly struggle to unify and learn multiple social perception tasks simultaneously, often exhibiting negative transfer. We identify that this negative transfer stems from a critical issue we term \"social degradation,\" whereby the general visual-linguistic pre-training process of VLMs impairs the visual encoder's ability to represent nuanced social information. We investigate this behavior further under two lenses: decodability through linear representation probing and compatibility through gradient conflict analysis, revealing that both play a role in the degradation, especially the former, which is significantly compromised in the VLM pre-training process. To address these issues, we propose SocialFusion, a unified framework that learns a minimal connection between a frozen visual encoder and a language model. Compared with existing VLMs, it exhibits positive transfer across all five social tasks, leveraging synergies between them to enhance overall performance and achieves comparable performance to task-specific state-of-the-art models on various benchmarks.

We formalize this degradation as a path-space Kullback-Leibler divergence(path-KL) between controlled and nominal (uncontrolled) diffusion processes, thereby showing via Girsanov's theorem that it exactly equals the control energy. Building on this stochastic optimal control (SOC) view, we theoretically establish that minimizing this path-KL simultaneously tightens upper bounds on both the 2-Wasserstein distance and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), revealing a principled connection between adversarial control energy and perceptual fidelity. From a variational perspective, we derive a first-order optimality condition for the control: among all directions that yield the same classification gain, the component tangent to iso-(log-)density surfaces (i.e., orthogonal to the score) minimizes path-KL, whereas the normal component directly increases distributional drift. This leads to DPAC (Distribution-Preserving Adversarial Control), a diffusion guidance rule that projects adversarial gradients onto the tangent space defined by the generative score geometry. We further show that in discrete solvers, the tangent projection cancels the O(\u0394t) leading error term in the Wasserstein distance, achieving an O(\u0394t^2) quality gap; moreover, it remains second-order robust to score or metric approximation. Empirical studies on ImageNet-100 validate the theoretical predictions, confirming that DPAC achieves lower FID and estimated path-KL at matched attack success rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDPAC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u751f\u6210\u5206\u6570\u51e0\u4f55\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8def\u5f84KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u6297\u63a7\u5236\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u540d\u4e49\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u53c8\u80fd\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u5dee\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u8def\u5f84KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a\u5728\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u540c\u5206\u7c7b\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u5411\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6570\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b49\u503c\u9762\u76f8\u5207\u7684\u5206\u91cf\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8def\u5f84KL\u3002\u63d0\u51faDPAC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u751f\u6210\u5206\u6570\u51e0\u4f55\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eDPAC\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e2d\u80fd\u5c06Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u9879\u4eceO(\u0394t)\u964d\u4f4e\u5230O(\u0394t\u00b2)\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5206\u6570\u6216\u5ea6\u91cf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5177\u6709\u4e8c\u9636\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002ImageNet-100\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1DPAC\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684FID\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u8def\u5f84KL\u3002", "conclusion": "DPAC\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u63a7\u5236\u9650\u5236\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b49\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8868\u9762\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing approaches heavily depend on supervised learning with extensive 3D annotations, which are often acquired from LiDAR point clouds through labor-intensive labeling processes. To tackle this problem, we propose VSRD++, a novel weakly supervised framework for monocular 3D object detection that eliminates the reliance on 3D annotations and leverages neural-field-based volumetric rendering with weak 2D supervision. VSRD++ consists of a two-stage pipeline: multi-view 3D autolabeling and subsequent monocular 3D detector training. In the multi-view autolabeling stage, object surfaces are represented as signed distance fields (SDFs) and rendered as instance masks via the proposed instance-aware volumetric silhouette rendering. To optimize 3D bounding boxes, we decompose each instance's SDF into a cuboid SDF and a residual distance field (RDF) that captures deviations from the cuboid. To address the geometry inconsistency commonly observed in volume rendering methods applied to dynamic objects, we model the dynamic objects by including velocity into bounding box attributes as well as assigning confidence to each pseudo-label. Moreover, we also employ a 3D attribute initialization module to initialize the dynamic bounding box parameters. In the monocular 3D object detection phase, the optimized 3D bounding boxes serve as pseudo labels for training monocular 3D object detectors. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate that VSRD++ significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised approaches for monocular 3D object detection on both static and dynamic scenes.

However, current text- or image-driven 3D scene generation methods mainly focus on large-scale scenes, struggling to capture the high-density layouts and complex spatial relations that characterize tabletop scenes. To address these challenges, we propose TabletopGen, a training-free, fully automatic framework that generates diverse, instance-level interactive 3D tabletop scenes. TabletopGen accepts a reference image as input, which can be synthesized by a text-to-image model to enhance scene diversity. We then perform instance segmentation and completion on the reference to obtain per-instance images. Each instance is reconstructed into a 3D model followed by canonical coordinate alignment. The aligned 3D models then undergo pose and scale estimation before being assembled into a collision-free, simulation-ready tabletop scene.

It is a pivotal evaluation metric in real-world scenarios with both class imbalance and decision constraints. However, selecting instances within these constrained intervals during its calculation is NP-hard, and thus typically requires approximation techniques for practical resolution. Despite the progress made in PAUC optimization over the last few years, most existing methods still suffer from uncontrollable approximation errors or a limited scalability when optimizing the approximate PAUC objectives. In this paper, we close the approximation gap of PAUC optimization by presenting two simple instance-wise minimax reformulations: one with an asymptotically vanishing gap, the other with the unbiasedness at the cost of more variables. Our key idea is to first establish an equivalent instance-wise problem to lower the time complexity, simplify the complicated sample selection procedure by threshold learning, and then apply different smoothing techniques. Equipped with an efficient solver, the resulting algorithms enjoy a linear per-iteration computational complexity w.r.t. the sample size and a convergence rate of $O(\u03b5^{-1/3})$ for typical one-way and two-way PAUCs. Moreover, we provide a tight generalization bound of our minimax reformulations. The result explicitly demonstrates the impact of the TPR/FPR constraints $\u03b1$/$\u03b2$ on the generalization and exhibits a sharp order of $\\tilde{O}(\u03b1^{-1}\\n_+^{-1} + \u03b2^{-1}\\n_-^{-1})$.

Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have motivated research into extending them to 3DVG. However, MLLMs primarily process 2D visual inputs and struggle with understanding 3D spatial structure of scenes solely from these limited perspectives. Existing methods mainly utilize viewpoint-dependent rendering of reconstructed point clouds to provide explicit structural guidance for MLLMs in 3DVG tasks, leading to inefficiency and limited spatial reasoning. To address this issue, we propose S$^2$-MLLM, an efficient framework that enhances spatial reasoning in MLLMs through implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce a spatial guidance strategy that leverages the structure awareness of feed-forward 3D reconstruction. By acquiring 3D structural understanding during training, our model can implicitly reason about 3D scenes without relying on inefficient point cloud reconstruction. Moreover, we propose a structure-enhanced module (SE), which first employs intra-view and inter-view attention mechanisms to capture dependencies within views and correspondences across views.

However, when extended to multiple subjects, existing models often exhibit degraded performance, particularly in maintaining subject consistency and adhering to textual prompts. We attribute these limitations to the absence of high-quality multi-subject datasets and refined post-training strategies. To address these challenges, we propose a scalable multi-subject data generation pipeline that leverages powerful single-subject generation models to construct diverse and high-quality multi-subject training data. Through this dataset, we first enable single-subject personalization models to acquire knowledge of synthesizing multi-image and multi-subject scenarios. Furthermore, to enhance both subject consistency and text controllability, we design a set of Pairwise Subject-Consistency Rewards and general-purpose rewards, which are incorporated into a refined reinforcement learning stage. To comprehensively evaluate multi-subject personalization, we introduce a new benchmark that assesses model performance using seven subsets across three dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in advancing multi-subject personalized image generation.

As a core component of document parsing, TR has long relied on supervised learning, with recent efforts dominated by fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) using labeled data. While VLMs have brought TR to the next level, pushing performance further demands large-scale labeled data that is costly to obtain. Consequently, although proprietary models have continuously pushed the performance boundary, open-source models, often trained with limited resources and, in practice, the only viable option for many due to privacy regulations, still lag far behind. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRivia, a self-supervised fine-tuning method that enables pretrained VLMs to learn TR directly from unlabeled table images in the wild. Built upon Group Relative Policy Optimization, TRivia automatically identifies unlabeled samples that most effectively facilitate learning and eliminates the need for human annotations through a question-answering-based reward mechanism. An attention-guided module generates diverse questions for each table image, and the ability to interpret the recognition results and answer them correctly provides feedback to optimize the TR model. This closed-loop process allows the TR model to autonomously learn to recognize, structure, and reason over tables without labeled data. Leveraging this pipeline, we present TRivia-3B, an open-sourced, compact, and state-of-the-art TR model that surpasses existing systems (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, MinerU2.5) on three popular benchmarks.

We present a computer-vision-based viscometer that infers viscosity by exploiting how a fixed background pattern becomes optically distorted as light refracts through the mixing-driven, continuously deforming free surface. Under diverse lighting conditions, the system achieves a mean absolute error of 0.113 in log m2 s^-1 units for regression and reaches up to 81% accuracy in viscosity-class prediction.

Traditional methods typically produce a single segmentation mask, failing to capture inherent uncertainty. Recent generative models enable the creation of multiple plausible masks per image, mimicking the collaborative interpretation of several clinicians. However, these approaches remain computationally heavy. We propose MedSegLatDiff, a diffusion based framework that combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a latent diffusion model for efficient medical image segmentation. The VAE compresses the input into a low dimensional latent space, reducing noise and accelerating training, while the diffusion process operates directly in this compact representation. We further replace the conventional MSE loss with weighted cross entropy in the VAE mask reconstruction path to better preserve tiny structures such as small nodules.

Recently, differentiable-rendering-based SLAM system has demonstrated significant potential, enabling photorealistic scene rendering through learnable scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Current differentiable rendering methods face dual challenges in real-time computation and sensor noise sensitivity, leading to degraded geometric fidelity in scene reconstruction and limited practicality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel real-time system EGG-Fusion, featuring robust sparse-to-dense camera tracking and a geometry-aware Gaussian surfel mapping module, introducing an information filter-based fusion method that explicitly accounts for sensor noise to achieve high-precision surface reconstruction. The proposed differentiable Gaussian surfel mapping effectively models multi-view consistent surfaces while enabling efficient parameter optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a surface reconstruction error of 0.6\\textit{cm} on standardized benchmark datasets including Replica and ScanNet++, representing over 20\\% improvement in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GS-based methods. Notably, the system maintains real-time processing capabilities at 24 FPS, establishing it as one of the most accurate differentiable-rendering-based real-time reconstruction systems.

While recent single-stage, anchor-free models like ActionFormer have set a high standard by leveraging Transformers for temporal reasoning, they often struggle with two persistent issues: the precise localization of actions with ambiguous or \"fuzzy\" temporal boundaries and the effective fusion of multi-scale contextual information. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Boundary Transformer (TBT-Former), a new architecture that directly addresses these limitations. TBT-Former enhances the strong ActionFormer baseline with three core contributions: (1) a higher-capacity scaled Transformer backbone with an increased number of attention heads and an expanded Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) dimension for more powerful temporal feature extraction; (2) a cross-scale feature pyramid network (FPN) that integrates a top-down pathway with lateral connections, enabling richer fusion of high-level semantics and low-level temporal details; and (3) a novel boundary distribution regression head. Inspired by the principles of Generalized Focal Loss (GFL), this new head recasts the challenging task of boundary regression as a more flexible probability distribution learning problem, allowing the model to explicitly represent and reason about boundary uncertainty. Within the paradigm of Transformer-based architectures, TBT-Former advances the formidable benchmark set by its predecessors, establishing a new level of performance on the highly competitive THUMOS14 and EPIC-Kitchens 100 datasets, while remaining competitive on the large-scale ActivityNet-1.3.

We propose DCText, a training-free visual text generation method that adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, leveraging the reliable short-text generation of Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers. Our method first decomposes a prompt by extracting and dividing the target text, then assigns each to a designated region. To accurately render each segment within their regions while preserving overall image coherence, we introduce two attention masks - Text-Focus and Context-Expansion - applied sequentially during denoising. Additionally, Localized Noise Initialization further improves text accuracy and region alignment without increasing computational cost.

In this paper, we present Gaussian Swaying, a surface-based framework for aerodynamic simulation using 3D Gaussians. Unlike mesh-based methods that require costly meshing, or particle-based approaches that rely on discrete positional data, Gaussian Swaying models surfaces continuously with 3D Gaussians, enabling efficient and fine-grained aerodynamic interaction. Our framework unifies simulation and rendering on the same representation: Gaussian patches, which support force computation for dynamics while simultaneously providing normals for lightweight shading.

However, unlike natural image datasets in computer vision, these neuroimaging data often exhibit high heterogeneity in quality, ranging from well-structured scans to severely distorted or incomplete brain volumes. This raises a fundamental question: can noise or low-quality scans contribute meaningfully to pretraining, or do they instead hinder model learning? In this study, we systematically explore the role of data quality level in pretraining and its impact on downstream tasks. Specifically, we perform pretraining on datasets with different quality levels and perform fine-tuning for brain age prediction on external cohorts. Our results show significant performance differences across quality levels, revealing both opportunities and limitations.

These advancements have greatly improved user satisfaction during the search process. However, previous work has failed to establish meaningful \"interaction\" between the retrieval system and the user, and its one-way retrieval paradigm can no longer fully meet the personalization and dynamic needs of at least 80.8\\% of users. In this paper, we introduce the Interactive Video Corpus Retrieval (IVCR) task, a more realistic setting that enables multi-turn, conversational, and realistic interactions between the user and the retrieval system. To facilitate research on this challenging task, we introduce IVCR-200K, a high-quality, bilingual, multi-turn, conversational, and abstract semantic dataset that supports video retrieval and even moment retrieval.

Designing robust watermarks capable of withstanding various attacks and processing operations is even more paramount. We introduce TokenPure, a novel Diffusion Transformer-based framework designed for effective and consistent watermark removal. TokenPure solves the trade-off between thorough watermark destruction and content consistency by leveraging token-based conditional reconstruction. It reframes the task as conditional generation, entirely bypassing the initial watermark-carrying noise. We achieve this by decomposing the watermarked image into two complementary token sets: visual tokens for texture and structural tokens for geometry. These tokens jointly condition the diffusion process, enabling the framework to synthesize watermark-free images with fine-grained consistency and structural integrity. Comprehensive experiments show that TokenPure achieves state-of-the-art watermark removal and reconstruction fidelity, substantially outperforming existing baselines in both perceptual quality and consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "TokenPure\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563Transformer\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u53bb\u9664\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee4\u724c\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u91cd\u5efa\u89e3\u51b3\u6c34\u5370\u53bb\u9664\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u7ecf\u6d4e\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u6c34\u5370\u5bf9\u4e8eAI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u865a\u62df\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6743\u8bc1\u660e\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u62b5\u6297\u5404\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u5904\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6c34\u5370\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u53bb\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "TokenPure\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563Transformer\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6c34\u5370\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u96c6\uff1a\u7528\u4e8e\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u548c\u7528\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee4\u724c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ee4\u724c\u5171\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5408\u6210\u65e0\u6c34\u5370\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTokenPure\u5728\u6c34\u5370\u53bb\u9664\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TokenPure\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee4\u724c\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u91cd\u5efa\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6c34\u5370\u53bb\u9664\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u7ecf\u6d4e\u65f6\u4ee3\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Despite the severity of these risks, there is a notable lack of dedicated datasets for the complex, enclosed environments found inside fuel tanks. To bridge this gap, we present a novel dataset, FOD-S2R, composed of real and synthetic images of the FOD within a simulated aircraft fuel tank. Unlike existing datasets that focus on external or open-air environments, our dataset is the first to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the real-world FOD detection performance in confined, closed structures. The real-world subset consists of 3,114 high-resolution HD images captured in a controlled fuel tank replica, while the synthetic subset includes 3,137 images generated using Unreal Engine. The dataset is composed of various Field of views (FOV), object distances, lighting conditions, color, and object size. Prior research has demonstrated that synthetic data can reduce reliance on extensive real-world annotations and improve the generalizability of vision models. Thus, we benchmark several state-of-the-art object detection models and demonstrate that introducing synthetic data improves the detection accuracy and generalization to real-world conditions.

However, current segmentation methods predominantly focus on image-based evaluation metrics, often neglecting their practical effectiveness in subsequent CFD applications. To address this deficiency, we present the Intracranial Aneurysm Vessel Segmentation (IAVS) dataset, the first comprehensive, multi-center collection comprising 641 3D MRA images with 587 annotations of aneurysms and IA-Vessels. In addition to image-mask pairs, IAVS dataset includes detailed hemodynamic analysis outcomes, addressing the limitations of existing datasets that neglect topological integrity and CFD applicability. To facilitate the development and evaluation of clinically relevant techniques, we construct two evaluation benchmarks including global localization of aneurysms (Stage I) and fine-grained segmentation of IA-Vessel (Stage II) and develop a simple and effective two-stage framework, which can be used as a out-of-the-box method and strong baseline. For comprehensive evaluation of applicability of segmentation results, we establish a standardized CFD applicability evaluation system that enables the automated and consistent conversion of segmentation masks into CFD models, offering an applicability-focused assessment of segmentation outcomes.

For prompt intervention and successful preventative tactics, early risk assessment is essential. To address this challenge, we used ensemble modeling and explainable AI (XAI) techniques to create an interpretable machine learning framework for stroke risk prediction. A thorough evaluation of 10 different machine learning models using 5-fold cross-validation across several datasets was part of our all-inclusive strategy, which also included feature engineering and data pretreatment (using Random Over-Sampling (ROS) to solve class imbalance). Our optimized ensemble model (Random Forest + ExtraTrees + XGBoost) performed exceptionally well, obtaining a strong 99.09% accuracy on the Stroke Prediction Dataset (SPD). We improved the model's transparency and clinical applicability by identifying three important clinical variables using LIME-based interpretability analysis: age, hypertension, and glucose levels.

However, existing methods still struggle to adhere to fine-grained prompt semantics, especially when prompts entail substantial transformations of the input image (e.g., object addition, deletion, or modification), a shortcoming we term semantic negligence. In a pilot study, we find that applying a Gaussian blur to the input image improves semantic adherence. Analyzing attention maps, we observe clearer foreground-background separation. From an energy perspective, this corresponds to a lower-entropy cross-attention distribution. Motivated by this, we introduce AlignVid, a training-free framework with two components: (i) Attention Scaling Modulation (ASM), which directly reweights attention via lightweight Q or K scaling, and (ii) Guidance Scheduling (GS), which applies ASM selectively across transformer blocks and denoising steps to reduce visual quality degradation. This minimal intervention improves prompt adherence while limiting aesthetic degradation. In addition, we introduce OmitI2V to evaluate semantic negligence in TI2V generation, comprising 367 human-annotated samples that span addition, deletion, and modification scenarios.

To address this challenge, we construct THQA-MT, the first large-scale Multi-Talker-generated Talking Human Quality Assessment dataset, consisting of 5,492 Multi-Talker-generated THs (MTHs) from 15 representative Multi-Talkers using 400 real portraits collected online.

In contrast, masked video modeling (MVM) directly exploits spatiotemporal structures but trails text-supervised methods on general tasks. We find this gap arises from overlooked architectural issues: pixel-level reconstruction struggles with convergence and its low-level requirement often conflicts with semantics, while latent prediction often encourages shortcut learning. To address these, we disentangle the traditional encoder-decoder design into an Encoder-Predictor-Decoder (EPD) framework, where the predictor acts as a latent world model, and propose InternVideo-Next, a two-stage pretraining scheme that builds a semantically consistent yet detail-preserving latent space for this world model. First, conventional linear decoder in pixel MVM enforces the predictor output latent to be linearly projected to, thus separable in pixel space, causing the conflict with semantic abstraction. Our Stage 1 proposes a conditional diffusion decoder and injects reliable image-level semantic priors to enhance semantics and convergence, thus bridging pixel-level fidelity with high-level semantic abstraction. Stage 2 further learns world knowledge by predicting frozen Stage 1 targets within this space, mitigating shortcut learning.

These languages, often lacking comprehensive linguistic resources, require special attention to develop robust systems for accurate optical character recognition (OCR). This paper introduces BharatOCR, a novel segmentation-free paragraph-level handwritten Hindi and Urdu text recognition. We propose a ViT-Transformer Decoder-LM architecture for handwritten text recognition, where a Vision Transformer (ViT) extracts visual features, a Transformer decoder generates text sequences, and a pre-trained language model (LM) refines the output to improve accuracy, fluency, and coherence. Our model utilizes a Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) model proposed for masked image modeling in this research work. In addition, we adopt a RoBERTa architecture optimized for masked language modeling (MLM) to enhance the linguistic comprehension and generative capabilities of the proposed model. The transformer decoder generates text sequences from visual embeddings. This model is designed to iteratively process a paragraph image line by line, called implicit line segmentation. The proposed model was evaluated using our custom dataset ('Parimal Urdu') and ('Parimal Hindi'), introduced in this research work, as well as two public datasets. The proposed model achieved benchmark results in the NUST-UHWR, PUCIT-OUHL, and Parimal-Urdu datasets, achieving character recognition rates of 96.24%, 92.05%, and 94.80%, respectively. The model also provided benchmark results using the Hindi dataset achieving a character recognition rate of 80.64%.

However, most existing approaches uniformly annotate 3D bounding boxes, ignore objects' physical states, and require multiple self-training iterations for annotation refinement, resulting in suboptimal quality and substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose OpenBox, a two-stage automatic annotation pipeline that leverages a 2D vision foundation model. In the first stage, OpenBox associates instance-level cues from 2D images processed by a vision foundation model with the corresponding 3D point clouds via cross-modal instance alignment.

In this paper, we propose BlinkBud, which utilizes a single earbud and a paired phone to online detect hazardous objects approaching from behind of a user. The core idea is to accurately track visually identified objects utilizing a small number of sampled camera images taken from the earbud. To minimize the power consumption of the earbud and the phone while guaranteeing the best tracking accuracy, a novel 3D object tracking algorithm is devised, integrating both a Kalman filter based trajectory estimation scheme and an optimal image sampling strategy based on reinforcement learning. Moreover, the impact of constant user head movements on the tracking accuracy is significantly eliminated by leveraging the estimated pitch and yaw angles to correct the object depth estimation and align the camera coordinate system to the user's body coordinate system, respectively. We implement a prototype BlinkBud system and conduct extensive real-world experiments. Results show that BlinkBud is lightweight with ultra-low mean power consumptions of 29.8 mW and 702.6 mW on the earbud and smartphone, respectively, and can accurately detect hazards with a low average false positive ratio (FPR) and false negative ratio (FNR) of 4.90% and 1.47%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "BlinkBud\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u8033\u673a\u548c\u914d\u5bf9\u624b\u673a\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7528\u6237\u540e\u65b9\u5371\u9669\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5371\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u884c\u4eba\u6216\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bdf\u89c9\u540e\u65b9\u5feb\u901f\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u5b58\u5728\u5de8\u5927\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5371\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u4fdd\u969c\u9053\u8def\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "method": "1) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u529f\u8017\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b3) \u5229\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4fef\u4ef0\u89d2\u548c\u504f\u822a\u89d2\u6821\u6b63\u76ee\u6807\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c06\u76f8\u673a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u7528\u6237\u8eab\u4f53\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u5934\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u8033\u673a\u5e73\u5747\u529f\u801729.8mW\uff0c\u624b\u673a702.6mW\uff1b\u5371\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5047\u9633\u6027\u73874.90%\uff0c\u5047\u9634\u6027\u73871.47%\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "BlinkBud\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u76843D\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u540e\u65b9\u5371\u9669\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u884c\u4eba\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u7684\u9053\u8def\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As the application grows, there is a growing demand for 3D shapes that look truly realistic. Traditional evaluation methods rely on a ground truth to measure mesh fidelity. However, in many practical cases, a shape's realism does not depend on having a ground truth reference. In this work, we propose a Shape-Realism Alignment Metric that leverages a large language model (LLM) as a bridge between mesh shape information and realism evaluation. To achieve this, we adopt a mesh encoding approach that converts 3D shapes into the language token space. A dedicated realism decoder is designed to align the language model's output with human perception of realism. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset, RealismGrading, which provides human-annotated realism scores without the need for ground truth shapes. Our dataset includes shapes generated by 16 different algorithms on over a dozen objects, making it more representative of practical 3D shape distributions. We validate our metric's performance and generalizability through k-fold cross-validation across different objects.

Existing metrics, such as Chamfer Distance, often fail to align with how humans evaluate the fidelity of 3D shapes. Recent learning-based metrics attempt to improve this by relying on rendered images and 2D image quality metrics. However, these approaches face limitations due to incomplete structural coverage and sensitivity to viewpoint choices. Moreover, most methods are trained on synthetic distortions, which differ significantly from real-world distortions, resulting in a domain gap. To address these challenges, we propose a new fidelity evaluation method that is based directly on 3D meshes with texture, without relying on rendering.

Existing approaches often require large-scale pre-training to learn relationships between the source and reference images, incurring high computational costs. As a training-free alternative, inversion techniques can be used to map the source image into a latent space for manipulation. However, our empirical study reveals that standard inversion is sub-optimal for EIE, leading to poor quality and inefficiency. To tackle this challenge, we introduce \\textbf{Reversible Inversion ({ReInversion})} for effective and efficient EIE. Specifically, ReInversion operates as a two-stage denoising process, which is first conditioned on the source image and subsequently on the reference. Besides, we introduce a Mask-Guided Selective Denoising (MSD) strategy to constrain edits to target regions, preserving the structural consistency of the background.

While diffusion models surpass GANs in perceptual quality, they under-reconstruct high-frequency (HF) details due to a low-frequency (LF) bias and a depth-wise \"low-first, high-later\" hierarchy. We introduce FRAMER, a plug-and-play training scheme that exploits diffusion priors without changing the backbone or inference. At each denoising step, the final-layer feature map teaches all intermediate layers. Teacher and student feature maps are decomposed into LF/HF bands via FFT masks to align supervision with the model's internal frequency hierarchy. For LF, an Intra Contrastive Loss (IntraCL) stabilizes globally shared structure. For HF, an Inter Contrastive Loss (InterCL) sharpens instance-specific details using random-layer and in-batch negatives.

In this paper, for the first time, we introduce MDMs into the Scene Text Recognition (STR) task. We show that vanilla MDM lags behind ARMs in terms of accuracy, although it improves recognition efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose MDiff4STR, a Mask Diffusion model enhanced with two key improvement strategies tailored for STR. Specifically, we identify two key challenges in applying MDMs to STR: noising gap between training and inference, and overconfident predictions during inference. Both significantly hinder the performance of MDMs. To mitigate the first issue, we develop six noising strategies that better align training with inference behavior. For the second, we propose a token-replacement noise mechanism that provides a non-mask noise type, encouraging the model to reconsider and revise overly confident but incorrect predictions. We conduct extensive evaluations of MDiff4STR on both standard and challenging STR benchmarks, covering diverse scenarios including irregular, artistic, occluded, and Chinese text, as well as whether the use of pretraining. Across these settings, MDiff4STR consistently outperforms popular STR models, surpassing state-of-the-art ARMs in accuracy, while maintaining fast inference with only three denoising steps.

In addition, we further propose the trajectory evidence-driven correction framework, comprising step-wise error trajectory and reward modeling on visual evidence-grounded correction. It encourages the model to explicitly concentrate on error propagation and key timestamps for correction. Extensive evaluation across 16 advanced MLLMs demonstrates that our \\textit{ViRectify} serves as a challenging testbed, where GPT-5 achieves only 31.94\\% correction accuracy. Our framework enables a Qwen2.5-VL-7B to consistently outperform the variants of 72B on \\textit{ViRectify}, showing the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis uncovers systematic asymmetries in error correction across models, and our dataset is also a valuable data resource to perform reflection learning. We believe \\textit{ViRectify} provides a new direction for comprehensively evaluating the advanced MLLMs in video reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViRectify\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b30K+\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5177\u8eab\u51b3\u7b56\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff0cGPT-5\u4ec5\u8fbe\u523031.94%\u7684\u7ea0\u6b63\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5f31\u70b9\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7AI\u8f85\u52a9\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6784\u5efa\u8d85\u8fc730K\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bc1\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ea0\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u9519\u8bef\u8f68\u8ff9\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u3002", "result": "\u572816\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbMLLMs\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aViRectify\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0cGPT-5\u4ec5\u8fbe\u523031.94%\u7684\u7ea0\u6b63\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4f7fQwen2.5-VL-7B\u6a21\u578b\u5728ViRectify\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e72B\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ViRectify\u4e3a\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e5f\u662f\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u601d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b9d\u8d35\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Prior work mitigates these issues with complex pipelines that first perform a base-resolution (i.e., training-resolution) denoising process to guide HR generation. We instead explore the intrinsic generative mechanisms of DiTs and propose ResDiT, a training-free method that scales resolution efficiently. We identify the core factor governing spatial layout, position embeddings (PEs), and show that the original PEs encode incorrect positional information when extrapolated to HR, which triggers layout collapse. To address this, we introduce a PE scaling technique that rectifies positional encoding under resolution changes. To further remedy low-fidelity details, we develop a local-enhancement mechanism grounded in base-resolution local attention. We design a patch-level fusion module that aggregates global and local cues, together with a Gaussian-weighted splicing strategy that eliminates grid artifacts. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ResDiT consistently delivers high-fidelity, high-resolution image synthesis and integrates seamlessly with downstream tasks, including spatially controlled generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faResDiT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3DiT\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5e03\u5c40\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3DiT\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u91c7\u7528\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u7d22DiT\u7684\u5185\u5728\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "1) \u8bc6\u522b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165(PEs)\u662f\u63a7\u5236\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPE\u7f29\u653e\u6280\u672f\u7ea0\u6b63\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u9519\u8bef\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f00\u53d1\u5c40\u90e8\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u805a\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b4) \u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u52a0\u6743\u62fc\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\u6d88\u9664\u7f51\u683c\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "result": "ResDiT\u80fd\u591f\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\uff09\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "ResDiT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea0\u6b63\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DiT\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose Clipomaly, the first CLIP-based open-world and anomaly segmentation method for autonomous driving. Our zero-shot approach requires no anomaly-specific training data and leverages CLIP's shared image-text embedding space to both segment unknown objects and assign human-interpretable names to them. Unlike open-vocabulary methods, our model dynamically extends its vocabulary at inference time without retraining, enabling robust detection and naming of anomalies beyond common class definitions such as those in Cityscapes.

Existing approaches typically divide this task into two stages: canonical template construction and target pose deformation. However, current template construction methods demand extensive skeletal rigging and often produce artifacts for specific poses. Moreover, target pose deformation suffers from structural distortions caused by Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), which significantly undermines animation realism. To address these problems, we propose a unified learning-based framework to address both challenges in two phases.

Anticipating basketball events requires understanding both physical motion patterns and their semantic significance in the context of the game. Traditional approaches that use only player positions fail to capture crucial indicators such as body orientation, defensive stance, or shooting preparation motions. Our two-stage approach first processes skeletal tracking data through Graph Neural Networks to capture nuanced motion patterns, then employs a Transformer architecture with specialized attention mechanisms to model player interactions. We introduce event projection heads that explicitly connect player movements to basketball events like passes, shots, and steals, training the model to associate physical motion patterns with their tactical purposes. Experiments on NBA tracking data demonstrate significant improvements over position-only baselines: 35% reduction in trajectory prediction error compared to state-of-the-art position-based models and consistent performance gains across key basketball analytics tasks. The resulting pretrained model serves as a powerful foundation for multiple downstream tasks, with pick detection, shot taker identification, assist prediction, shot location classification, and shot type recognition demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "CourtMotion\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9aa8\u9abc\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7bee\u7403\u65f6\u7a7a\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548cTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7403\u5458\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8eab\u4f53\u671d\u5411\u3001\u9632\u5b88\u59ff\u6001\u3001\u6295\u7bee\u51c6\u5907\u52a8\u4f5c\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u7406\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5904\u7406\u9aa8\u9abc\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u5177\u6709\u4e13\u95e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u7403\u5458\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6295\u5f71\u5934\u5c06\u7403\u5458\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7403\u3001\u6295\u7bee\u3001\u62a2\u65ad\u7b49\u7bee\u7403\u4e8b\u4ef6\u660e\u786e\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u5728NBA\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c1135%\uff1b\u5728pick\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u6295\u7bee\u8005\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u52a9\u653b\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u6295\u7bee\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u6295\u7bee\u7c7b\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "CourtMotion\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9aa8\u9abc\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u7bee\u7403\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

To this end, we aim for training a network on one domain (e.g., CT) and directly apply it to a different domain (e.g., MR) without adapting the model and without requiring images or annotations from the new domain during training. We propose a novel method for promoting DG when training deep segmentation networks, which we call SRCSM. During training, our method diversifies the source domain through semantic-aware random convolution, where different regions of a source image are augmented differently, based on their annotation labels. At test-time, we complement the randomization of the training domain via mapping the intensity of target domain images, making them similar to source domain data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on a variety of cross-modality and cross-center generalization settings for abdominal, whole-heart and prostate segmentation, where we outperform previous DG techniques in a vast majority of experiments. Additionally, we also investigate our method when training on whole-heart CT or MR data and testing on the diastolic and systolic phase of cine MR data captured with different scanner hardware, where we make a step towards closing the domain gap in this even more challenging setting.

Yet bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions that define local quantum fields in many-body systems. We introduce QuantumCanvas, a large-scale multimodal benchmark that treats two-body quantum systems as foundational units of matter. The dataset spans 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties and paired with ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections. These physically grounded images encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates, providing an interpretable visual modality for quantum learning. Benchmarking eight architectures across 18 targets, we report mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN. For energy-related quantities, DimeNet attains 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, while a multimodal fusion model achieves a 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas further improves convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets such as QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM.

Despite their strong performance, diffusion models still struggle in managing image collections with significant feature differences. They often fail to capture complex features and produce conflicting results. Research has attempted to address this issue by learning different regions of an image through multiple diffusion paths and then combining them. However, this approach leads to inefficient coordination among multiple paths and high computational costs. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a Diffusion Fuzzy System (DFS), a latent-space multi-path diffusion model guided by fuzzy rules. DFS offers several advantages. First, unlike traditional multi-path diffusion methods, DFS uses multiple diffusion paths, each dedicated to learning a specific class of image features. By assigning each path to a different feature type, DFS overcomes the limitations of multi-path models in capturing heterogeneous image features. Second, DFS employs rule-chain-based reasoning to dynamically steer the diffusion process and enable efficient coordination among multiple paths. Finally, DFS introduces a fuzzy membership-based latent-space compression mechanism to reduce the computational costs of multi-path diffusion effectively. We tested our method on three public datasets: LSUN Bedroom, LSUN Church, and MS COCO. The results show that DFS achieves more stable training and faster convergence than existing single-path and multi-path diffusion models. Additionally, DFS surpasses baseline models in both image quality and alignment between text and images, and also shows improved accuracy when comparing generated images to target references.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u7cca\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08DFS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\u5408\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\u5408\u65f6\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u7cca\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08DFS\uff09\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8def\u5f84\u4e13\u95e8\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u94fe\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u8c03\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u96b6\u5c5e\u5ea6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728LSUN Bedroom\u3001LSUN Church\u548cMS COCO\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1aDFS\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "DFS\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Yet, fragmented evaluations, heterogeneous datasets, and inconsistent metrics have hindered progress toward clinical translation. Here, we present a large-scale, multi-center benchmark of deep unsupervised anomaly detection for brain imaging. The training cohort comprised 2,976 T1 and 2,972 T2-weighted scans from healthy individuals across six scanners, with ages ranging from 6 to 89 years. Validation used 92 scans to tune hyperparameters and estimate unbiased thresholds. Testing encompassed 2,221 T1w and 1,262 T2w scans spanning healthy datasets and diverse clinical cohorts. Across all algorithms, the Dice-based segmentation performance varied between 0.03 and 0.65, indicating substantial variability. To assess robustness, we systematically evaluated the impact of different scanners, lesion types and sizes, as well as demographics (age, sex). Reconstruction-based methods, particularly diffusion-inspired approaches, achieved the strongest lesion segmentation performance, while feature-based methods showed greater robustness under distributional shifts. However, systematic biases, such as scanner-related effects, were observed for the majority of algorithms, including that small and low-contrast lesions were missed more often, and that false positives varied with age and sex. Increasing healthy training data yields only modest gains, underscoring that current unsupervised anomaly detection frameworks are limited algorithmically rather than by data availability.

Recently, feed-forward methods have emerged as efficient and robust alternatives to traditional per-scene optimization techniques. Among them, state-of-the-art models like the Visual Geometry Grounding Transformer (VGGT) leverage full self-attention over all image tokens to capture global relationships. However, this approach suffers from poor scalability due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and the large number of tokens generated in long image sequences. In this work, we introduce FlashVGGT, an efficient alternative that addresses this bottleneck through a descriptor-based attention mechanism. Instead of applying dense global attention across all tokens, FlashVGGT compresses spatial information from each frame into a compact set of descriptor tokens. Global attention is then computed as cross-attention between the full set of image tokens and this smaller descriptor set, significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, the compactness of the descriptors enables online inference over long sequences via a chunk-recursive mechanism that reuses cached descriptors from previous chunks. Experimental results show that FlashVGGT achieves reconstruction accuracy competitive with VGGT while reducing inference time to just 9.3% of VGGT for 1,000 images, and scaling efficiently to sequences exceeding 3,000 images.

Available public datasets primarily focus on malignant lesions and often overlook other space-occupying conditions in this region. To address this gap, we introduce MasHeNe, an initial dataset of 3,779 contrast-enhanced CT slices that includes both tumors and cysts with pixel-level annotations. We also establish a benchmark using standard segmentation baselines and report common metrics to enable fair comparison. In addition, we propose the Windowing-Enhanced Mamba with Frequency integration (WEMF) model. WEMF applies tri-window enhancement to enrich the input appearance before feature extraction. It further uses multi-frequency attention to fuse information across skip connections within a U-shaped Mamba backbone. On MasHeNe, WEMF attains the best performance among evaluated methods, with a Dice of 70.45%, IoU of 66.89%, NSD of 72.33%, and HD95 of 5.12 mm. This model indicates stable and strong results on this challenging task. MasHeNe provides a benchmark for head-and-neck mass segmentation beyond malignancy-only datasets.

Also, the quality of motion data is inconsistent, and textual annotation lacks fine-grained details in these datasets. In contrast, RoleMotion is meticulously designed and collected with a particular focus on scenes and roles. The dataset features 25 classic scenes, 110 functional roles, over 500 behaviors, and 10296 high-quality human motion sequences of body and hands, annotated with 27831 fine-grained text descriptions.

Accurate detection and delineation of these lesions on imaging are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical intervention. In this study, we introduce AbscessHeNe, a curated and comprehensively annotated dataset comprising 4,926 contrast-enhanced CT slices with clinically confirmed head and neck abscesses. The dataset is designed to facilitate the development of robust semantic segmentation models that can accurately delineate abscess boundaries and evaluate deep neck space involvement, thereby supporting informed clinical decision-making. To establish performance baselines, we evaluate several state-of-the-art segmentation architectures, including CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based models. The highest-performing model achieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.39, Intersection-over-Union of 0.27, and Normalized Surface Distance of 0.67, indicating the challenges of this task and the need for further research. Beyond segmentation, AbscessHeNe is structured for future applications in content-based multimedia indexing and case-based retrieval. Each CT scan is linked with pixel-level annotations and clinical metadata, providing a foundation for building intelligent retrieval systems and supporting knowledge-driven clinical workflows.

This paper presents a depth matching method for borehole images based on the Shape Dynamic Time Warping (ShapeDTW) algorithm. The method extracts local shape features to construct a morphologically sensitive distance matrix, better preserving structural similarity between sequences during alignment. We implement this by employing a combined feature set of the one-dimensional Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG1D) and the original signal as the shape descriptor.

We introduce SPARK, a framework for reconstructing physically consistent, kinematic part-level articulated objects from a single RGB image. Given an input image, we first leverage VLMs to extract coarse URDF parameters and generate part-level reference images.

TTT reformulates attention operation as an online learning problem, constructing a compact inner model from key-value pairs at test time. This reformulation opens a rich and flexible design space while achieving linear computational complexity. However, crafting a powerful visual TTT design remains challenging: fundamental choices for the inner module and inner training lack comprehensive understanding and practical guidelines. To bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we present a systematic empirical study of TTT designs for visual sequence modeling. From a series of experiments and analyses, we distill six practical insights that establish design principles for effective visual TTT and illuminate paths for future improvement. These findings culminate in the Vision Test-Time Training (ViT$^3$) model, a pure TTT architecture that achieves linear complexity and parallelizable computation. We evaluate ViT$^3$ across diverse visual tasks, including image classification, image generation, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Results show that ViT$^3$ consistently matches or outperforms advanced linear-complexity models (e.g., Mamba and linear attention variants) and effectively narrows the gap to highly optimized vision Transformers.

Building upon the SFE module, an advanced Spatial Feature Enhancement with Geometrically Adaptive Fusion (SFE-GAF) module is subsequently developed. In the SFE-GAF module, adaptive sampling is utilized to focus on true vessel morphology precisely.

Despite recent progress, achieving balanced detection performance across diverse object scales remains a formidable challenge, particularly in scenarios where dense tiny objects and large objects coexist. Although large foundation models have revolutionized general vision tasks, their application to tiny object detection remains unexplored due to the extreme scale variation and density distribution inherent to remote sensing imagery. To bridge this scale gap, we propose ScaleBridge-Det, to the best of our knowledge, the first large detection framework designed for tiny objects, which could achieve balanced performance across diverse scales through scale-adaptive expert routing and density-guided query allocation. Specifically, we introduce a Routing-Enhanced Mixture Attention (REM) module that dynamically selects and fuses scale-specific expert features via adaptive routing to address the tendency of standard MoE models to favor dominant scales. REM generates complementary and discriminative multi-scale representations suitable for both tiny and large objects. Furthermore, we present a Density-Guided Dynamic Query (DGQ) module that predicts object density to adaptively adjust query positions and numbers, enabling efficient resource allocation for objects of varying scales. The proposed framework allows ScaleBridge-Det to simultaneously optimize performance for both dense tiny and general objects without trade-offs.

However, these models falter in long-tail settings, such as medical imaging, where rare pathologies comprise a small fraction of data. This results in mode collapse: tail-class outputs lack quality and diversity, undermining the goal of synthetic data augmentation for underrepresented conditions. We pinpoint gradient conflicts between frequent head and rare tail classes as the primary culprit, a factor unaddressed by existing sampling or conditioning methods that mainly steer inference without altering the learned distribution. To resolve this, we propose GRASP: Guided Residual Adapters with Sample-wise Partitioning. GRASP uses external priors to statically partition samples into clusters that minimize intra-group gradient clashes. It then fine-tunes pre-trained models by injecting cluster-specific residual adapters into transformer feedforward layers, bypassing learned gating for stability and efficiency. On the long-tail MIMIC-CXR-LT dataset, GRASP yields superior FID and diversity metrics, especially for rare classes, outperforming baselines like vanilla fine-tuning and Mixture of Experts variants. Downstream classification on NIH-CXR-LT improves considerably for tail labels. Generalization to ImageNet-LT confirms broad applicability.

Current methods utilize HOI representation as an auxiliary generative objective to guide video synthesis. However, there is a dilemma between 2D and 3D representations that cannot simultaneously guarantee scalability and interaction fidelity. To address this limitation, we propose a structure and contact-aware representation that captures hand-object contact, hand-object occlusion, and holistic structure context without 3D annotations. This interaction-oriented and scalable supervision signal enables the model to learn fine-grained interaction physics and generalize to open-world scenarios. To fully exploit the proposed representation, we introduce a joint-generation paradigm with a share-and-specialization strategy that generates interaction-oriented representations and videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two real-world datasets in generating physics-realistic and temporally coherent HOI videos.

Most computational pathology models are trained on large tissue images from resection specimens, limiting their use in real-world settings where small biopsies are common.

To address these limitations, we introduce DreamingComics, a layout-aware story visualization framework. We build upon a pretrained video diffusion-transformer (DiT) model, leveraging its spatiotemporal priors to enhance identity and style consistency. For layout-based position control, we propose RegionalRoPE, a region-aware positional encoding scheme that re-indexes embeddings based on the target layout. Additionally, we introduce a masked condition loss to further constrain each subject's visual features to their designated region. To infer layouts from natural language scripts, we integrate an LLM-based layout generator trained to produce comic-style layouts, enabling flexible and controllable layout conditioning. We present a comprehensive evaluation of our approach, showing a 29.2% increase in character consistency and a 36.2% increase in style similarity compared to previous methods, while displaying high spatial accuracy.

This paper proposes a novel Semantic and Spatial Rectification (SSR) method to address the limitations of existing CLIP-based weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches: over-activation in non-target foreground regions and background areas. Specifically, at the semantic level, the Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment (CMPA) establishes a contrastive learning mechanism to enforce feature space alignment across modalities, reducing inter-class overlap while enhancing semantic correlations, to rectify over-activation in non-target foreground regions effectively; at the spatial level, the Superpixel-Guided Correction (SGC) leverages superpixel-based spatial priors to precisely filter out interference from non-target regions during affinity propagation, significantly rectifying background over-activation.

While recent models achieve impressive results on single edits, they suffer from severe quality degradation under multi-turn editing. Through systematic analysis, we identify progressive loss of high-frequency information as the primary cause of this quality degradation. We present FreqEdit, a training-free framework that enables stable editing across 10+ consecutive iterations. Our approach comprises three synergistic components: (1) high-frequency feature injection from reference velocity fields to preserve fine-grained details, (2) an adaptive injection strategy that spatially modulates injection strength for precise region-specific control, and (3) a path compensation mechanism that periodically recalibrates the editing trajectory to prevent over-constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreqEdit achieves superior performance in both identity preservation and instruction following compared to seven state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "FreqEdit\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u5165\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u8865\u507f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8f6e\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b010+\u8f6e\u7a33\u5b9a\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4e22\u5931\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d28\u91cf\u9000\u5316\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "FreqEdit\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u4ece\u53c2\u8003\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u6ce8\u5165\u9ad8\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u5165\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u8c03\u5236\u6ce8\u5165\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u533a\u57df\u63a7\u5236\uff1b3\uff09\u8def\u5f84\u8865\u507f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9a\u671f\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u7f16\u8f91\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cFreqEdit\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e7\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b010+\u8f6e\u8fde\u7eed\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "conclusion": "FreqEdit\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8f6e\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While incorporating past actions and observations can improve decision making, naive use of full history leads to excessive computational overhead and distraction from irrelevant information. To address this, we introduce HiconAgent, a GUI agent trained with History Context-aware Policy Optimization (HCPO) for efficient and effective utilization of historical information. HCPO optimizes history usage in both sampling and policy updates through two complementary components: (1) Dynamic Context Sampling (DCS) presents the agent with variable length histories during sampling, enabling adaptive use of the most relevant context; (2) Anchor-guided History Compression (AHC) refines the policy update phase with a dual branch strategy where the compressed branch removes history observations while keeping history actions as information flow anchors. The compressed and uncompressed branches are coupled through a history-enhanced alignment loss to enforce consistent history usage while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on mainstream GUI navigation benchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Despite being smaller, HiconAgent-3B outperforms GUI-R1-7B by +8.46 percent grounding accuracy and +11.32 percent step success rate on GUI-Odyssey, while achieving comparable results on AndroidControl and AITW with up to 2.47x computational speedup and 60 percent FLOPs reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "HiconAgent\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08HCPO\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684GUI\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u951a\u5b9a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884cGUI\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "GUI\u4ee3\u7406\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u7b80\u5355\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u5386\u53f2\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8fc7\u5927\u548c\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08HCPO\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91c7\u6837\uff08DCS\uff09\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u5386\u53f2\uff1b2\uff09\u951a\u5b9a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u538b\u7f29\uff08AHC\uff09\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u5206\u652f\u79fb\u9664\u5386\u53f2\u89c2\u5bdf\u4f46\u4fdd\u7559\u5386\u53f2\u52a8\u4f5c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u8026\u5408\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41GUI\u5bfc\u822a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1aHiconAgent-3B\u5728GUI-Odyssey\u4e0a\u6bd4GUI-R1-7B\u63d0\u53478.46%\u7684\u63a5\u5730\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c11.32%\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u5728AndroidControl\u548cAITW\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u53ef\u6bd4\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad82.47\u500d\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\u548c60%\u7684FLOPs\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "HiconAgent\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684GUI\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Identifying meaningful activities or situations (e.g., two objects coming closer) remains difficult and cannot be achieved by content extraction alone. Currently, Video Situation Analysis (VSA) is done manually with a human in the loop, which is error-prone and labor-intensive, or through custom algorithms designed for specific video types or situations. These algorithms are not general-purpose and require a new algorithm/software for each new situation or video from a new domain.\n  This report proposes a general-purpose VSA framework that overcomes the above limitations. Video contents are extracted once using state-of-the-art Video Content Extraction technologies. They are represented using two alternative models -- the extended relational model (R++) and graph models. When represented using R++, the extracted contents can be used as data streams, enabling Continuous Query Processing via the proposed Continuous Query Language for Video Analysis. The graph models complement this by enabling the detection of situations that are difficult or impossible to detect using the relational model alone. Existing graph algorithms and newly developed algorithms support a wide variety of situation detection. To support domain independence, primitive situation variants across domains are identified and expressed as parameterized templates.

Traditional registration techniques often struggle with challenges such as contrast differences, spatial distortions, and modality-specific variations. To address these limitations, we propose a method that integrates learnable edge kernels with learning-based rigid and non-rigid registration techniques. Unlike conventional layers that learn all features without specific bias, our approach begins with a predefined edge detection kernel, which is then perturbed with random noise. These kernels are learned during training to extract optimal edge features tailored to the task. This adaptive edge detection enhances the registration process by capturing diverse structural features critical in medical imaging. To provide clearer insight into the contribution of each component in our design, we introduce four variant models for rigid registration and four variant models for non-rigid registration.

While SAM2 excels in video object segmentation by providing dense segmentation masks based on prompts, extending it to dense Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS) poses challenges due to the need for spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and the ability to track multiple objects with complex boundaries and varying scales. This paper explores the extension of SAM2 for VSS, focusing on two primary approaches and highlighting firsthand observations and common challenges faced during this process. The first approach involves using SAM2 to extract unique objects as masks from a given image, with a segmentation network employed in parallel to generate and refine initial predictions. The second approach utilizes the predicted masks to extract unique feature vectors, which are then fed into a simple network for classification. The resulting classifications and masks are subsequently combined to produce the final segmentation. Our experiments suggest that leveraging SAM2 enhances overall performance in VSS, primarily due to its precise predictions of object boundaries.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAM2\u6269\u5c55\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u63d0\u53d6\u5bf9\u8c61\u63a9\u7801\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\u5e76\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c2) \u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u540e\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSAM2\u80fd\u63d0\u5347VSS\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u5176\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u8fb9\u754c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "SAM2\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272(VSS)\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u590d\u6742\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u5c06SAM2\u6269\u5c55\u5230VSS\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528SAM2\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u552f\u4e00\u5bf9\u8c61\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u521d\u59cb\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u63a9\u7801\u63d0\u53d6\u552f\u4e00\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u7b80\u5355\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u63a9\u7801\u7ec4\u5408\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5229\u7528SAM2\u80fd\u63d0\u5347VSS\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5f97\u76ca\u4e8e\u5176\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u8fb9\u754c\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SAM2\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5176\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u8fb9\u754c\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u63d0\u5347VSS\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

Critically, existing pure-vision encoders and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are strongly appearance-biased, lack temporal understanding, and thus struggle to discern intricate motion dynamics and anatomical implausibilities in generated videos. We tackle this gap by introducing a novel evaluation metric derived from a learned latent space of real-world human actions. Our method first captures the nuances, constraints, and temporal smoothness of real-world motion by fusing appearance-agnostic human skeletal geometry features with appearance-based features. We posit that this combined feature space provides a robust representation of action plausibility. Given a generated video, our metric quantifies its action quality by measuring the distance between its underlying representations and this learned real-world action distribution. For rigorous validation, we develop a new multi-faceted benchmark specifically designed to probe temporally challenging aspects of human action fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our metric achieves substantial improvement of more than 68% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, performs competitively on established external benchmarks, and has a stronger correlation with human perception.

However, their reliance on static, single-image generation in training and evaluation leads to overfitting to static pattern matching and semantic fusion, while fundamentally hindering their ability to model dynamic processes that unfold over time. To address these constraints, we propose Envision-a causal event progression benchmark for chained text-to-multi-image generation. Grounded in world knowledge and structured by spatiotemporal causality, it reorganizes existing evaluation dimensions and includes 1,000 four-stage prompts spanning six scientific and humanities domains. To transition evaluation from single images to sequential frames and assess whether models truly internalize world knowledge while adhering to causal-temporal constraints, we introduce Envision-Score, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional consistency, physicality, and aesthetics. Comprehensive evaluation of 15 models (10 specialized T2I models, 5 unified models) uncovers: specialized T2I models demonstrate proficiency in aesthetic rendering yet lack intrinsic world knowledge. Unified multimodal models bridge this gap, consistently outperforming specialized counterparts in causal narrative coherence. However, even these unified architectures remain subordinate to closed-source models and struggle to overcome the core challenge of spatiotemporal consistency. This demonstrates that a focus on causally-isolated single images impedes multi-frame reasoning and generation, promoting static pattern matching over dynamic world modeling-ultimately limiting world knowledge internalization, generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEnvision\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fdb\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62df\u5408\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5185\u5316\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u9075\u5faa\u56e0\u679c-\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEnvision\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b1000\u4e2a\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u516d\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u4eba\u6587\u9886\u57df\u3002\u5f15\u5165Envision-Score\u7efc\u5408\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u7269\u7406\u6027\u548c\u7f8e\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f3015\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0810\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e1aT2I\u6a21\u578b\uff0c5\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u4e13\u4e1aT2I\u6a21\u578b\u7f8e\u5b66\u6e32\u67d3\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u53d9\u4e8b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u4f1a\u963b\u788d\u591a\u5e27\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u800c\u975e\u52a8\u6001\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u9650\u5236\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5185\u5316\u548c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Current methods predominantly rely on verbal descriptive tuning, which suffers from visual illiteracy, i.e., they learn spatial concepts through textual symbols alone, devoid of connection to their visual manifestations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces MILO, an Implicit spatIaL wOrld modeling paradigm that simulates human-like spatial imagination. MILO integrates a visual generator to provide geometry-aware feedback, thereby implicitly grounding the MLLM's symbolic reasoning in perceptual experience. Complementing this paradigm, we propose RePE (Relative Positional Encoding), a novel encoding scheme that captures relative camera-pose transformations, offering superior performance over absolute coordinate systems. To support the training, we construct GeoGen, a large-scale Geometry-aware Generative dataset with approximately 2,241 videos and 67,827 observation-action-outcome triplets.

To replicate this capability in modern AI systems, we introduce the task of visual causal discovery.

To this end, we first construct the Visual Causal Graph dataset (VCG-32K), a large-scale collection of over 32,000 images annotated with entity-level causal graphs, and further develop CauSight, a novel vision-language model to perform visual causal discovery through causally aware reasoning.

However, the learning nature of SFT still limits the generalization of reasoning, thereby constraining the full potential of driving performance. Meanwhile, current RFT approaches are primarily applied to downstream tasks, since scene understanding is an open-ended problem where corresponding rewards are difficult to quantify. To address these limitations, we propose OpenREAD, an OPEN-ended REasoning reinforced vision-language model (VLM)-based autonomous driving (AD) framework that enables end-to-end RFT across the full spectrum from high-level reasoning to low-level trajectory planning. Specifically, we begin by constructing large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations on open-source driving-related knowledge datasets, and employ the powerful Qwen3 large language model (LLM) as the critic in RFT to quantify reasoning quality for open-ended questions during reward modeling.

However, whether these models can understand physics and generate physically plausible videos remains a question. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used as general-purpose evaluators in various applications, they struggle to identify the physically impossible content from generated videos. To investigate this issue, we construct a \\textbf{PID} (\\textbf{P}hysical \\textbf{I}mplausibility \\textbf{D}etection) dataset, which consists of a \\textit{test split} of 500 manually annotated videos and a \\textit{train split} of 2,588 paired videos, where each implausible video is generated by carefully rewriting the caption of its corresponding real-world video to induce T2V models producing physically implausible content. With the constructed dataset, we introduce a lightweight fine-tuning approach, enabling VLMs to not only detect physically implausible events but also generate textual explanations on the violated physical principles. Taking the fine-tuned VLM as a physical plausibility detector and explainer, namely \\textbf{PhyDetEx}, we benchmark a series of state-of-the-art T2V models to assess their adherence to physical laws. Our findings show that although recent T2V models have made notable progress toward generating physically plausible content, understanding and adhering to physical laws remains a challenging issue, especially for open-source models.

In this work, we cast registration as conditional generation: a learned continuous, point-wise velocity field transports noisy points to a registered scene, from which the pose of each view is recovered. Unlike previous methods that conduct correspondence matching to estimate the transformation between a pair of point clouds and then optimize the pairwise transformations to realize multi-view registration, our model directly generates the registered point cloud. With a lightweight local feature extractor and test-time rigidity enforcement, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on pairwise and multi-view registration benchmarks, particularly with low overlap, and generalizes across scales and sensor modalities.

Existing end-to-end models often struggle with this temporal hierarchy, offering solutions that lack generalization, incur high development costs for new tasks, and suffer from poor interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a reconfigurable Multi-Agent System (MAS) as a foundational framework for sports video understanding. In our system, each agent functions as a distinct \"cognitive tool\" specializing in a specific aspect of analysis. The system's architecture is not confined to a single temporal dimension or task. By leveraging iterative invocation and flexible composition of these agents, our framework can construct adaptive pipelines for both short-term analytic reasoning (e.g., Rally QA) and long-term generative summarization (e.g., match summaries). We demonstrate the adaptability of this framework using two representative tasks in badminton analysis, showcasing its ability to bridge fine-grained event detection and global semantic organization.

This work has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "summary": "Tracking cells in time-lapse videos is an essential technique for monitoring cell population dynamics at a single-cell level. Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death.

Vision provides global context but lacks direct measurements of properties such as texture and hardness, whereas touch supplies these cues. Modern visuo-tactile sensors capture both modalities in a single fused image, yielding intrinsically aligned inputs that are well suited to manipulation tasks requiring visual and tactile information. Most self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks, however, compress feature maps into a global vector, discarding spatial structure and misaligning with the needs of manipulation. To address this, we propose SARL, a spatially-aware SSL framework that augments the Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) architecture with three map-level objectives, including Saliency Alignment (SAL), Patch-Prototype Distribution Alignment (PPDA), and Region Affinity Matching (RAM), to keep attentional focus, part composition, and geometric relations consistent across views. These losses act on intermediate feature maps, complementing the global objective. SARL consistently outperforms nine SSL baselines across six downstream tasks with fused visual-tactile data. On the geometry-sensitive edge-pose regression task, SARL achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.3955, a 30% relative improvement over the next-best SSL method (0.5682 MAE) and approaching the supervised upper bound.

Yet, these models remain vulnerable to hallucination outputs that appear plausible but are in fact incorrect. In the natural image domain, several decoding strategies have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations by reinforcing visual evidence, but most rely on secondary decoding or rollback procedures that substantially slow inference. Moreover, existing solutions are often domain-specific and may introduce misalignment between modalities or between generated and ground-truth content. We introduce Med-VCD, a sparse visual-contrastive decoding method that mitigates hallucinations in medical LVLMs without the time overhead of secondary decoding. Med-VCD incorporates a novel token-sparsification strategy that selects visually informed tokens on the fly, trimming redundancy while retaining critical visual context and thus balancing efficiency with reliability. Evaluations on eight medical datasets, spanning ophthalmology, radiology, and pathology tasks in visual question answering, report generation, and dedicated hallucination benchmarks, show that Med-VCD raises factual accuracy by an average of 13\\% and improves hallucination accuracy by 6\\% relative to baseline medical LVLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Med-VCD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u533b\u7597\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e8c\u6b21\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u57288\u4e2a\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u602713%", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8c\u6b21\u89e3\u7801\u6216\u56de\u6eda\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u6216\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5185\u5bb9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50", "method": "Med-VCD\u91c7\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "result": "\u5728\u6db5\u76d6\u773c\u79d1\u3001\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u548c\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u76848\u4e2a\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u3001\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cMed-VCD\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u533b\u7597LVLMs\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u602713%\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u5e7b\u89c9\u51c6\u786e\u60276%", "conclusion": "Med-VCD\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u533b\u7597\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e8c\u6b21\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027"}}

However, threats to MOT algorithms have yet been widely studied. In particular, incorrect association between the tracked objects and their assigned IDs can lead to severe consequences, such as wrong trajectory predictions. Previous attacks against MOT either focused on hijacking the trackers of individual objects, or manipulating the tracker IDs in MOT by attacking the integrated object detection (OD) module in the digital domain, which are model-specific, non-robust, and only able to affect specific samples in offline datasets. In this paper, we present AdvTraj, the first online and physical ID-manipulation attack against tracking-by-detection MOT, in which an attacker uses adversarial trajectories to transfer its ID to a targeted object to confuse the tracking system, without attacking OD. Our simulation results in CARLA show that AdvTraj can fool ID assignments with 100% success rate in various scenarios for white-box attacks against SORT, which also have high attack transferability (up to 93% attack success rate) against state-of-the-art (SOTA) MOT algorithms due to their common design principles. We characterize the patterns of trajectories generated by AdvTraj and propose two universal adversarial maneuvers that can be performed by a human walker/driver in daily scenarios.

Token pruning is a technique used to mitigate this issue by removing redundancy, but existing methods often ignore relevance to the user query or suffer from the limitations of attention mechanisms, reducing their adaptability and effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Script, a plug-and-play pruning method that requires no retraining and generalizes across diverse MLLMs. Script comprises two modules: a graph-structured pruning module that removes visually redundant tokens, and a query-conditioned semantic pruning module that preserves query-relevant visual information.

Conventional simulation-based approaches rely on explicitly defined rigid object models and pre-scripted hand gestures, making them inadequate for capturing dynamic interactions with non-rigid or articulated entities such as deformable fabrics, elastic materials, hinge-based structures, furry surfaces, or even living creatures. In this paper, we present SpriteHand, an autoregressive video generation framework for real-time synthesis of versatile hand-object interaction videos across a wide range of object types and motion patterns. SpriteHand takes as input a static object image and a video stream in which the hands are imagined to interact with the virtual object embedded in a real-world scene, and generates corresponding hand-object interaction effects in real time. Our model employs a causal inference architecture for autoregressive generation and leverages a hybrid post-training approach to enhance visual realism and temporal coherence. Our 1.3B model supports real-time streaming generation at around 18 FPS and 640x368 resolution, with an approximate 150 ms latency on a single NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, and more than a minute of continuous output.

This paper introduces a new task ``Image Collaborative Segmentation and Captioning'' (SegCaptioning), which aims to translate a straightforward prompt, like a bounding box around an object, into diverse semantic interpretations represented by (caption, masks) pairs, allowing flexible result selection by users. This task poses significant challenges, including accurately capturing a user's intention from a minimal prompt while simultaneously predicting multiple semantically aligned caption words and masks. Technically, we propose a novel Scene Graph Guided Diffusion Model that leverages structured scene graph features for correlated mask-caption prediction. Initially, we introduce a Prompt-Centric Scene Graph Adaptor to map a user's prompt to a scene graph, effectively capturing his intention. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion process incorporating a Scene Graph Guided Bimodal Transformer to predict correlated caption-mask pairs by uncovering intricate correlations between them. To ensure accurate alignment, we design a Multi-Entities Contrastive Learning loss to explicitly align visual and textual entities by considering inter-modal similarity, resulting in well-aligned caption-mask pairs.

Empirical observations indicate that such purely linguistic intermediate reasoning often reduces performance on perception tasks. We argue that the core issue lies not in reasoning per se but in the form of reasoning: while these chains perform semantic reasoning in an unstructured linguistic space, visual perception requires reasoning in a spatial and object-centric space. In response, we introduce Artemis, a perception-policy learning framework that performs structured proposal-based reasoning, where each intermediate step is represented as a (label, bounding-box) pair capturing a verifiable visual state. This design enables explicit tracking of intermediate states, direct supervision for proposal quality, and avoids ambiguity introduced by language-based reasoning. Artemis is built on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, achieves strong performance on grounding and detection task and exhibits substantial generalization to counting and geometric-perception tasks. The consistent improvements across these diverse settings confirm that aligning reasoning with spatial representations enhances perception-policy learning. Owing to its strengthened visual reasoning, Artemis also achieves competitive performance on general MLLM benchmarks, illustrating that spatially grounded reasoning provides a principled route toward scalable and general perception policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Artemis\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u8bae\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u6807\u7b7e-\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u5bf9\uff09\u4ee3\u66ff\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u9700\u8981\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faArtemis\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u8bae\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\uff08\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff09\u5bf9\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u663e\u5f0f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u63d0\u8bae\u8d28\u91cf\u76f4\u63a5\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "Artemis\u5728Qwen2.5-VL-3B\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5728grounding\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u7528MLLM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4grounding\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u901a\u7528\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Unlike existing approaches that rely on textual instructions or demonstration videos, which often limited by ambiguity or occlusion, audio provides real-time, semantically rich, and visually independent cues for affordance grounding, enabling more intuitive understanding of interaction regions. To support this task, we construct the first AV-AG dataset, comprising a large collection of action sounds, object images, and pixel-level affordance annotations. The dataset also includes an unseen subset to evaluate zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, we propose AVAGFormer, a model equipped with a semantic-conditioned cross-modal mixer and a dual-head decoder that effectively fuses audio and visual signals for mask prediction.

However, its ``fastforward'' nature introduces key challenges in both the training objective and the guidance mechanism. First, the original MF's training target depends not only on the underlying ground-truth fields but also on the network itself. To address this issue, we recast the objective as a loss on the instantaneous velocity $v$, re-parameterized by a network that predicts the average velocity $u$. Our reformulation yields a more standard regression problem and improves the training stability. Second, the original MF fixes the classifier-free guidance scale during training, which sacrifices flexibility. We tackle this issue by formulating guidance as explicit conditioning variables, thereby retaining flexibility at test time. The diverse conditions are processed through in-context conditioning, which reduces model size and benefits performance.

We present TUNA, a native UMM that builds a unified continuous visual representation by cascading a VAE encoder with a representation encoder. This unified representation space allows end-to-end processing of images and videos for both understanding and generation tasks. Compared to prior UMMs with decoupled representations, TUNA's unified visual space avoids representation format mismatches introduced by separate encoders, outperforming decoupled alternatives in both understanding and generation. Moreover, we observe that stronger pretrained representation encoders consistently yield better performance across all multimodal tasks, highlighting the importance of the representation encoder. Finally, in this unified setting, jointly training on both understanding and generation data allows the two tasks to benefit from each other rather than interfere.

However, precisely editing these captured motions remains a significant challenge, especially under complex object movements. Current motion-controlled image-to-video (I2V) approaches often lack full-scene context for consistent video editing, while video-to-video (V2V) methods provide viewpoint changes or basic object translation, but offer limited control over fine-grained object motion. We present a track-conditioned V2V framework that enables joint editing of camera and object motion. We achieve this by conditioning a video generation model on a source video and paired 3D point tracks representing source and target motions. These 3D tracks establish sparse correspondences that transfer rich context from the source video to new motions while preserving spatiotemporal coherence. Crucially, compared to 2D tracks, 3D tracks provide explicit depth cues, allowing the model to resolve depth order and handle occlusions for precise motion editing.

We investigate their representation of a fundamental law: gravity. Out-of-the-box video generators consistently generate objects falling at an effectively slower acceleration. However, these physical tests are often confounded by ambiguous metric scale. We first investigate if observed physical errors are artifacts of these ambiguities (e.g., incorrect frame rate assumptions). We find that even temporal rescaling cannot correct the high-variance gravity artifacts. To rigorously isolate the underlying physical representation from these confounds, we introduce a unit-free, two-object protocol that tests the timing ratio $t_1^2/t_2^2 = h_1/h_2$, a relationship independent of $g$, focal length, and scale.

Project page: https://stevenlsw.github.io/visualsync/", "summary": "Today, people can easily record memorable moments, ranging from concerts, sports events, lectures, family gatherings, and birthday parties with multiple consumer cameras. However, synchronizing these cross-camera streams remains challenging. Existing methods assume controlled settings, specific targets, manual correction, or costly hardware. We present VisualSync, an optimization framework based on multi-view dynamics that aligns unposed, unsynchronized videos at millisecond accuracy. Our key insight is that any moving 3D point, when co-visible in two cameras, obeys epipolar constraints once properly synchronized. To exploit this, VisualSync leverages off-the-shelf 3D reconstruction, feature matching, and dense tracking to extract tracklets, relative poses, and cross-view correspondences. It then jointly minimizes the epipolar error to estimate each camera's time offset. Experiments on four diverse, challenging datasets show that VisualSync outperforms baseline methods, achieving an median synchronization error below 50 ms.", "AI": {"tldr": "VisualSync\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u672a\u6807\u5b9a\u3001\u672a\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u8fd0\u52a83D\u70b9\u7684\u6781\u7ebf\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u540c\u6b65\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u8bb0\u5f55\u5404\u79cd\u91cd\u8981\u65f6\u523b\uff0c\u4f46\u8de8\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u53d7\u63a7\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u624b\u52a8\u6821\u6b63\u6216\u6602\u8d35\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "VisualSync\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u6d1e\u5bdf\u662f\uff1a\u4efb\u4f55\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u76843D\u70b9\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u76f8\u673a\u4e2d\u53ef\u89c1\u65f6\uff0c\u4e00\u65e6\u6b63\u786e\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u5c31\u4f1a\u6ee1\u8db3\u6781\u7ebf\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u76f8\u5bf9\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6781\u7ebf\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVisualSync\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u540c\u6b65\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e50\u6beb\u79d2\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "VisualSync\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89c6\u9891\u540c\u6b65\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53d7\u63a7\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u624b\u52a8\u6821\u6b63\u6216\u6602\u8d35\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u540c\u6b65\u3002"}}

Yet their stringent precision requirements demand highly robust models whose training relies on large amounts of annotated data. However, this kind of data is difficult to obtain in routine practice, especially negative samples. In this work, we focus on pipetting, the most critical and precision sensitive action in SDLs. To overcome the scarcity of training data, we build a hybrid pipeline that fuses real and virtual data generation. The real track adopts a human-in-the-loop scheme that couples automated acquisition with selective human verification to maximize accuracy with minimal effort. The virtual track augments the real data using reference-conditioned, prompt-guided image generation, which is further screened and validated for reliability. Together, these two tracks yield a class-balanced dataset that enables robust bubble detection training. On a held-out real test set, a model trained entirely on automatically acquired real images reaches 99.6% accuracy, and mixing real and generated data during training sustains 99.4% accuracy while reducing collection and review load.

Despite promising demonstrations, SDTs face persistent challenges: fusing heterogeneous imaging, kinematics, and physiology under strict latency budgets; balancing model fidelity with computational efficiency; ensuring robustness, interpretability, and calibrated uncertainty; and achieving interoperability, privacy, and regulatory compliance in clinical environments. This survey offers a critical, structured review of SDTs. We clarify terminology and scope, propose a taxonomy by purpose, model fidelity, and data sources, and synthesize state-of-the-art achievements in deformable registration and tracking, real-time simulation and co-simulation, AR/VR guidance, edge-cloud orchestration, and AI for scene understanding and prediction. We contrast non-robotic twins with robot-in-the-loop architectures for shared control and autonomy, and identify open problems in validation and benchmarking, safety assurance and human factors, lifecycle \"digital thread\" integration, and scalable data governance.

To scale data collection, many researchers have turned to leveraging human manipulation videos available online.

In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines large foundation models for video understanding with point tracking techniques to extract dense trajectories of all task-relevant keypoints during manipulation.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent VLN advancements in robotics and outlines promising directions to improve multi-robot coordination. Despite progress, current models struggle with bidirectional communication, ambiguity resolution, and collaborative decision-making in the multi-agent systems. We review approximately 200 relevant articles to provide an in-depth understanding of the current landscape. Through this survey, we aim to provide a thorough resource that inspires further research at the intersection of VLN and robotics.

These issues are particularly problematic in drone applications where robust and accurate state estimation is critical for safe autonomous operation. In this work, we present ICD-Net, a novel framework that enhances visual-inertial SLAM performance by learning to process raw inertial measurements and generating displacement estimates with associated uncertainty quantification. Rather than relying on analytical inertial sensor models that struggle with real-world sensor imperfections, our method directly extracts displacement maps from sensor data while simultaneously predicting measurement covariances that reflect estimation confidence. We integrate ICD-Net outputs as additional residual constraints into the VINS-Fusion optimization framework, where the predicted uncertainties appropriately weight the neural network contributions relative to traditional visual and inertial terms. The learned displacement constraints provide complementary information that compensates for various error sources in the SLAM pipeline. Our approach can be used under both normal operating conditions and in situations of camera inconsistency or visual degradation. Experimental evaluation on challenging high-speed drone sequences demonstrated that our approach significantly improved trajectory estimation accuracy compared to standard VINS-Fusion, with more than 38% improvement in mean APE and uncertainty estimates proving crucial for maintaining system robustness. Our method shows that neural network enhancement can effectively address multiple sources of SLAM degradation while maintaining real-time performance requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "ICD-Net\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cb\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4f4d\u79fb\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u60ef\u6027SLAM\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u8f68\u8ff9\u7cbe\u5ea638%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u60ef\u6027SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e38\u56e0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faICD-Net\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u53d6\u4f4d\u79fb\u56fe\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u6d4b\u91cf\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8f93\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u989d\u5916\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ea6\u675f\u96c6\u6210\u5230VINS-Fusion\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9002\u5f53\u52a0\u6743\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6VINS-Fusion\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bef\u5dee(APE)\u6539\u5584\u8d85\u8fc738%\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u4fdd\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u79cdSLAM\u9000\u5316\u6e90\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u60ef\u6027SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u8865\u507f\u5404\u79cd\u8bef\u5dee\u6e90\u3002"}}

Prior image imagination based VLN work shows benefits for discrete panoramas but lacks online, action-conditioned predictions and does not produce explicit planning values; moreover, many methods replace the planner with long-horizon objectives that are brittle and slow. To bridge this gap, we propose VISTAv2, a generative world model that rolls out egocentric future views conditioned on past observations, candidate action sequences, and instructions, and projects them into an online value map for planning. Unlike prior approaches, VISTAv2 does not replace the planner. The online value map is fused at score level with the base objective, providing reachability and risk-aware guidance. Concretely, we employ an action-aware Conditional Diffusion Transformer video predictor to synthesize short-horizon futures, align them with the natural language instruction via a vision-language scorer, and fuse multiple rollouts in a differentiable imagination-to-value head to output an imagined egocentric value map. For efficiency, rollouts occur in VAE latent space with a distilled sampler and sparse decoding, enabling inference on a single consumer GPU. Evaluated on MP3D and RoboTHOR, VISTAv2 improves over strong baselines, and ablations show that action-conditioned imagination, instruction-guided value fusion, and the online value-map planner are all critical, suggesting that VISTAv2 offers a practical and interpretable route to robust VLN.", "AI": {"tldr": "VISTAv2\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee5\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u4ef7\u503c\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u7ebf\u3001\u4ee5\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2\uff09\u4e0d\u4ea7\u751f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4ef7\u503c\uff1b3\uff09\u8bb8\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u76ee\u6807\u66ff\u4ee3\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8106\u5f31\u4e14\u7f13\u6162\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u56fe\u53c8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u89c4\u5212\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "VISTAv2\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5408\u6210\u77ed\u65f6\u57df\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u60f3\u8c61\u5230\u4ef7\u503c\u5934\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u6f14\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4ef7\u503c\u5730\u56fe\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u63a8\u6f14\u5728VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u84b8\u998f\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728MP3D\u548cRoboTHOR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cVISTAv2\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u60f3\u8c61\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u4ef7\u503c\u5730\u56fe\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u90fd\u662f\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eVISTAv2\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "VISTAv2\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u4ef7\u503c\u5730\u56fe\u89c4\u5212\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4e0d\u66ff\u4ee3\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u800c\u662f\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing rigid or affine registration methods fail to model such complex deformations, whereas traditional non-rigid techniques tend to overfit and lack robustness in sparse-texture sonar data. To address these challenges, we propose a coarse-to-fine hierarchical non-rigid registration framework tailored for large-scale side-scan sonar images. Our method begins with a global Thin Plate Spline initialization from sparse correspondences, followed by superpixel-guided segmentation that partitions the image into structurally consistent patches preserving terrain integrity.

We attribute this gap to two factors: the lack of state-action-state dynamics modeling and the unnecessary redundancy of explicit geometric reconstruction. We introduce AFRO, a self-supervised framework that learns dynamics-aware 3D representations without action or reconstruction supervision. AFRO casts state prediction as a generative diffusion process and jointly models forward and inverse dynamics in a shared latent space to capture causal transition structure. To prevent feature leakage in action learning, we employ feature differencing and inverse-consistency supervision, improving the quality and stability of visual features. When combined with Diffusion Policy, AFRO substantially increases manipulation success rates across 16 simulated and 4 real-world tasks, outperforming existing pre-training approaches. The framework also scales favorably with data volume and task complexity. Qualitative visualizations indicate that AFRO learns semantically rich, discriminative features, offering an effective pre-training solution for 3D representation learning in robotics.

Systems that optimize only one link (data collection, simulation, learning, or deployment) rarely sustain improvement or generalize beyond narrow settings. We introduce Arcadia, a closed-loop framework that operationalizes embodied lifelong learning by tightly coupling four stages: (1) Self-evolving exploration and grounding for autonomous data acquisition in physical environments, (2) Generative scene reconstruction and augmentation for realistic and extensible scene creation, (3) a Shared embodied representation architecture that unifies navigation and manipulation within a single multimodal backbone, and (4) Sim-from-real evaluation and evolution that closes the feedback loop through simulation-based adaptation. This coupling is non-decomposable: removing any stage breaks the improvement loop and reverts to one-shot training. Arcadia delivers consistent gains on navigation and manipulation benchmarks and transfers robustly to physical robots, indicating that a tightly coupled lifecycle: continuous real-world data acquisition, generative simulation update, and shared-representation learning, supports lifelong improvement and end-to-end generalization.

Radioactive watermarks -- marks that transfer to a model's outputs -- can help detect when such unauthorized data has been used for training. Moreover, aside from being radioactive, an effective watermark for protecting images from unauthorized training also needs to meet other existing requirements, such as imperceptibility, robustness, and multi-bit capacity. To overcome these challenges, we propose HMARK, a novel multi-bit watermarking scheme, which encodes ownership information as secret bits in the semantic-latent space (h-space) for image diffusion models. By leveraging the interpretability and semantic significance of h-space, ensuring that watermark signals correspond to meaningful semantic attributes, the watermarks embedded by HMARK exhibit radioactivity, robustness to distortions, and minimal impact on perceptual quality. Experimental results demonstrate that HMARK achieves 98.57% watermark detection accuracy, 95.07% bit-level recovery accuracy, 100% recall rate, and 1.0 AUC on images produced by the downstream adversarial model finetuned with LoRA on watermarked data across various types of distortions.", "AI": {"tldr": "HMARK\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08h-space\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u6240\u6709\u6743\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u6240\u6709\u6743\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u6743\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u6c34\u5370\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u68c0\u6d4b\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u5bb9\u91cf\u7b49\u8981\u6c42", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHMARK\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08h-space\uff09\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u79d8\u5bc6\u6bd4\u7279\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u6743\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5229\u7528h-space\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6c34\u5370\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u5e94\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cHMARK\u5728\u7ecfLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u6297\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u5931\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\uff0c\u8fbe\u523098.57%\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u300195.07%\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u7ea7\u6062\u590d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001100%\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c1.0\u7684AUC\u503c", "conclusion": "HMARK\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u56fe\u50cf\u514d\u53d7\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u7528"}}

The key idea of MoLT is to replace conventional, computationally heavy sequential adaptation at every transformer layer with a parallel, lightweight scheme that extracts and fuses layer-wise tokens only from the late layers. We adopt two types of adapters to distill modality-specific information and cross-modal interaction into compact latent tokens in a layer-wise manner. A token fusion module then dynamically fuses these layer-wise tokens by taking into account their relative significance. To prevent the redundancy of latent tokens, we apply an orthogonality regularization between latent tokens during training. Through the systematic analysis of the position of adaptation in the pre-trained transformers, we extract latent tokens only from the late layers of the transformers. This strategic adaptation approach avoids error propagation from the volatile early-layer features, thereby maximizing the adaptation performance while maintaining parameter and memory efficiency.

To support multimodal music generation, we construct ArtiCaps, a pseudo feeling-aligned image-music-text dataset created by semantically matching descriptions from ArtEmis and MusicCaps. We further propose Art2Music, a lightweight cross-modal framework that synthesizes music from artistic images and user comments. In the first stage, images and text are encoded with OpenCLIP and fused using a gated residual module; the fused representation is decoded by a bidirectional LSTM into Mel-spectrograms with a frequency-weighted L1 loss to enhance high-frequency fidelity. In the second stage, a fine-tuned HiFi-GAN vocoder reconstructs high-quality audio waveforms. Experiments on ArtiCaps show clear improvements in Mel-Cepstral Distortion, Frechet Audio Distance, Log-Spectral Distance, and cosine similarity. A small LLM-based rating study further verifies consistent cross-modal feeling alignment and offers interpretable explanations of matches and mismatches across modalities. These results demonstrate improved perceptual naturalness, spectral fidelity, and semantic consistency.

Building dependable machine learning systems therefore requires methods that can both estimate predictive \\textit{uncertainty} and detect \\textit{out-of-distribution (OOD)} samples in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{TIE: a Training--Inversion--Exclusion} framework for visually interpretable and uncertainty-guided anomaly detection that jointly addresses these challenges through iterative refinement. TIE extends a standard $n$-class classifier to an $(n+1)$-class model by introducing a garbage class initialized with Gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. Within each epoch, TIE performs a closed-loop process of \\textit{training, inversion, and exclusion}, where highly uncertain inverted samples reconstructed from the just-trained classifier are excluded into the garbage class. Over successive iterations, the inverted samples transition from noisy artifacts into visually coherent class prototypes, providing transparent insight into how the model organizes its learned manifolds. During inference, TIE rejects OOD inputs by either directly mapping them to the garbage class or producing low-confidence, uncertain misclassifications within the in-distribution classes that are easily separable, all without relying on external OOD datasets. A comprehensive threshold-based evaluation using multiple OOD metrics and performance measures such as \\textit{AUROC}, \\textit{AUPR}, and \\textit{FPR@95\\%TPR} demonstrates that TIE offers a unified and interpretable framework for robust anomaly detection and calibrated uncertainty estimation (UE) achieving near-perfect OOD detection with \\textbf{\\(\\!\\approx\\!\\) 0 FPR@95\\%TPR} when trained on MNIST or FashionMNIST and tested against diverse unseen datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "TIE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3-\u53cd\u8f6c-\u6392\u9664\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u5305\u542b\u5783\u573e\u7c7b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8OOD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u4f30\u8ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u68c0\u6d4bOOD\u6837\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTIE\uff08\u8bad\u7ec3-\u53cd\u8f6c-\u6392\u9664\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06n\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a(n+1)\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u5783\u573e\u7c7b\uff1b2\uff09\u6bcf\u4e2aepoch\u6267\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u53cd\u8f6c\u3001\u6392\u9664\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b3\uff09\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u53cd\u8f6c\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u6392\u9664\u5230\u5783\u573e\u7c7b\uff1b4\uff09\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53cd\u8f6c\u6837\u672c\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u4f2a\u5f71\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7c7b\u539f\u578b\u3002", "result": "TIE\u5728MNIST\u548cFashionMNIST\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08\u22480 FPR@95%TPR\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7AUROC\u3001AUPR\u3001FPR@95%TPR\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eTIE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "TIE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u70bc\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8OOD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548cOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing data-collection pipelines suffer from inaccurate motion retargeting, low data-collection efficiency, and missing high-resolution fingertip tactile sensing. We address this gap with MILE, a mechanically isomorphic teleoperation and data-collection system co-designed from human hand to exoskeleton to robotic hand. The exoskeleton is anthropometrically derived from the human hand, and the robotic hand preserves one-to-one joint-position isomorphism, eliminating nonlinear retargeting and enabling precise, natural control. The exoskeleton achieves a multi-joint mean absolute angular error below one degree, while the robotic hand integrates compact fingertip visuotactile modules that provide high-resolution tactile observations. Built on this retargeting-free interface, we teleoperate complex, contact-rich in-hand manipulation and efficiently collect a multimodal dataset comprising high-resolution fingertip visuotactile signals, RGB-D images, and joint positions. The teleoperation pipeline achieves a mean success rate improvement of 64%. Incorporating fingertip tactile observations further increases the success rate by an average of 25% over the vision-only baseline, validating the fidelity and utility of the dataset.

We compare magnitude thresholding to three 1D CNNs for time-series analysis: a literature baseline (separable convolutions) and two ultra-light models - one purely separable and one with residual connections. Using the BioStampRC21 dataset, 2 s windows at 30 Hz, and subject-independent leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on 16 PwPD with chest-worn IMUs, our residual separable model (Model 2, 533 params) attains PR-AUC = 94.5%, F1 = 91.2%, MCC = 89.4%, matching or surpassing the baseline (5,552 params; PR-AUC = 93.7%, F1 = 90.5%, MCC = 88.5%) with approximately 10x fewer parameters. The smallest model (Model 1, 305 params) reaches PR-AUC = 94.0%, F1 = 91.0%, MCC = 89.1%. Thresholding obtains high recall (89.0%) but low precision (76.5%), yielding many false positives and high inter-subject variance. Sensor-position analysis (train-on-all) shows chest and thighs are most reliable; forearms degrade precision/recall due to non-gait arm motion; naive fusion of all sites does not outperform the best single site. Both compact CNNs execute within tight memory/latency budgets on STM32-class MCUs (sub-10 ms on low-power boards), enabling on-sensor gating of transmission/storage.

To address these gaps, we propose \\textit{SelfAI}, a general multi-agent platform that combines a User Agent for translating high-level research objectives into standardized experimental configurations, a Cognitive Agent powered by LLMs with optimal stopping criteria to iteratively refine hyperparameter searches, and an Experiment Manager responsible for orchestrating parallel, fault-tolerant training workflows across heterogeneous hardware while maintaining a structured knowledge base for continuous feedback. We further introduce two novel evaluation metrics, Score and $\\text{AUP}_D$, to quantify discovery efficiency and search diversity.

Our key idea is to decompose each rotation into its \\emph{Transformed Basis Vectors} (TBVs)-three unit vectors on \\(S^2\\)-and align the resulting spherical point sets per axis using fast, robust matchers (SPMC, FRS, and a hybrid). To handle axis relabels and sign flips, we introduce a \\emph{Permutation-and-Sign Invariant} (PASI) wrapper that enumerates the 24 proper signed permutations, scores them via summed correlations, and fuses the per-axis estimates into a single rotation by projection/Karcher mean. The overall complexity remains linear in the number of rotations (\\(\\mathcal{O}(n)\\)), contrasting with \\(\\mathcal{O}(N_r^3\\log N_r)\\) for spherical/\\(SO(3)\\) correlation. Experiments on EuRoC Machine Hall simulations\n  (axis-consistent) and the ETH Hand-Eye benchmark (\\texttt{robot\\_arm\\_real})\n  (axis-ambiguous) show that our methods are accurate, 6-60x faster than traditional methods, and robust under extreme outlier ratios (up to 90\\%), all without correspondence search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u96c6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65cb\u8f6c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53d8\u6362\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u7403\u9762\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6392\u5217\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5305\u88c5\u5668\u5904\u7406\u8f74\u91cd\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u7ffb\u8f6c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6807\u5b9a\u548c\u914d\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u96c6\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e38\u53d7\u5230\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u8f74\u7ea6\u5b9a\u7684\u963b\u788d\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u654f\u611f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65cb\u8f6c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u53d8\u6362\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\uff08TBVs\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u7403\u9762\u4e0a\u5f62\u6210\u70b9\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5668\uff08SPMC\u3001FRS\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u6309\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u6392\u5217\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff08PASI\uff09\u5305\u88c5\u5668\u679a\u4e3e24\u79cd\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5e26\u7b26\u53f7\u6392\u5217\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u6392\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u5f71/Karcher\u5e73\u5747\u5c06\u5404\u8f74\u4f30\u8ba1\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u65cb\u8f6c\u3002", "result": "\u5728EuRoC Machine Hall\u4eff\u771f\uff08\u8f74\u4e00\u81f4\uff09\u548cETH Hand-Eye\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u8f74\u6a21\u7cca\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb6-60\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65e0\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u65cb\u8f6c\u96c6\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7403\u9762\u70b9\u96c6\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6392\u5217\u7b26\u53f7\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u6807\u5b9a\u548c\u914d\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Our evaluation shows that the best-performing current models exhibit promising overall performance, but become increasingly unreliable at even moderate complexity levels easily handled by humans.

Deep learning is widely used to develop SLR-based systems; however, it is computationally intensive and requires substantial computational resources, making it unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. To address this, we propose an efficient sign language recognition system using MediaPipe and an echo state network (ESN)-based bidirectional reservoir computing (BRC) architecture. MediaPipe extracts hand joint coordinates, which serve as inputs to the ESN-based BRC architecture. The BRC processes these features in both forward and backward directions, efficiently capturing temporal dependencies. The resulting states of BRC are concatenated to form a robust representation for classification. We evaluated our method on the Word-Level American Sign Language (WLASL) video dataset, achieving a competitive accuracy of 57.71% and a significantly lower training time of only 9 seconds, in contrast to the 55 minutes and $38$ seconds required by the deep learning-based Bi-GRU approach.

Med-CMR thus provides a stress test for visual-reasoning integration and rare-case robustness in medical MLLMs, and a rigorous yardstick for future clinical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Med-CMR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30MLLMs\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0GPT-5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u4f46\u4e13\u4e1a\u533b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "MLLMs\u5f00\u59cb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u533b\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u533b\u5b66\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1) \u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u89e3\uff1a\u5c06\u533b\u5b66\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7ec6\u5206\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff1b2) \u6311\u6218\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u6db5\u76d6\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u7ec6\u8282\u533a\u5206\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6db5\u76d6\u56db\u79cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u573a\u666f\uff1b3) \u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8986\u76d6\uff1a\u5305\u542b20,653\u4e2aVQA\u5bf9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d611\u4e2a\u5668\u5b98\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c12\u79cd\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4e13\u5bb6\u5ba1\u6838\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f3018\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684MLLMs\uff0cGPT-5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08\u591a\u9009\u9898\u51c6\u786e\u738757.81%\uff0c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\u5f97\u520648.70\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eGemini 2.5 Pro\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578bQwen3-VL-235B-A22B\u3002\u4e13\u4e1a\u533b\u5b66MLLMs\u672a\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u957f\u5c3e\u6cdb\u5316\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "Med-CMR\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66MLLMs\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u6574\u5408\u548c\u7f55\u89c1\u75c5\u4f8b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4e34\u5e8a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

While existing approaches have primarily focused on visual observations, real-world perception inherently involves multiple sensory modalities. Audio provides crucial spatial and temporal cues such as sound source localization and acoustic scene properties, yet its integration into world models remains largely unexplored. No prior work has formally defined what constitutes an audio-visual world model or how to jointly capture binaural spatial audio and visual dynamics under precise action control with task reward prediction. This work presents the first formal framework for Audio-Visual World Models (AVWM), formulating multimodal environment simulation as a partially observable Markov decision process with synchronized audio-visual observations, fine-grained actions, and task rewards. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct AVW-4k, a dataset comprising 30 hours of binaural audio-visual trajectories with action annotations and reward signals across 76 indoor environments. We propose AV-CDiT, an Audio-Visual Conditional Diffusion Transformer with a novel modality expert architecture that balances visual and auditory learning, optimized through a three-stage training strategy for effective multimodal integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AV-CDiT achieves high-fidelity multimodal prediction across visual and auditory modalities with reward. Furthermore, we validate its practical utility in continuous audio-visual navigation tasks, where AVWM significantly enhances the agent's performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b(AVWM)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u53cc\u8033\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684AVW-4k\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86AV-CDiT\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u611f\u5b98\u6a21\u6001\u3002\u97f3\u9891\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u5982\u58f0\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u5c06\u5176\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u5f88\u6709\u9650\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u6ca1\u6709\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5956\u52b1\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u8054\u5408\u6355\u6349\u53cc\u8033\u7a7a\u95f4\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b(AVWM)\u6b63\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u62df\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u540c\u6b65\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u30022. \u6784\u5efaAVW-4k\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b30\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u53cc\u8033\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d676\u4e2a\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e26\u6709\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u30023. \u63d0\u51faAV-CDiT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u5e73\u8861\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u542c\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6574\u5408\u3002", "result": "AV-CDiT\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u542c\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u5305\u542b\u5956\u52b1\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u3002\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cAVWM\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u521b\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8054\u5408\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing implicit memory-based methods struggle with long-term memory retention and planning, while explicit map-based approaches lack rich semantic information. To address these challenges, we propose FOM-Nav, a modular framework that enhances exploration efficiency through Frontier-Object Maps and vision-language models. Our Frontier-Object Maps are built online and jointly encode spatial frontiers and fine-grained object information. Using this representation, a vision-language model performs multimodal scene understanding and high-level goal prediction, which is executed by a low-level planner for efficient trajectory generation. To train FOM-Nav, we automatically construct large-scale navigation datasets from real-world scanned environments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model design and constructed dataset.

Our approach introduces a staged-reset exploration strategy that stabilizes long-horizon privileged-policy training, and a GRPO-based fine-tuning procedure that mitigates partial observability and improves closed-loop consistency in sim-to-real RL. Trained entirely on simulation data, the resulting policy achieves robust zero-shot performance across diverse door types and outperforms human teleoperators by up to 31.7% in task completion time under the same whole-body control stack.

Such shifts can take many forms: new classes may emerge that were absent during training, a problem known as open-set recognition, and the distribution of known categories may change. Guarantees on open-set recognition are mostly derived under the assumption that the distribution of known classes, which we call \\emph{the background distribution}, is fixed. In this paper we develop \\ours{}, a method that is guaranteed to solve open-set recognition even in the challenging case where the background distribution shifts. We prove that the method works under benign assumptions that the novel class is separable from the non-novel classes, and provide theoretical guarantees that it outperforms a representative baseline in a simplified overparameterized setting.

Inspired by the MoE design paradigms established in large language models (LLMs), we identify a set of crucial architectural factors for building effective Diffusion MoE models--including DeepSeek-style expert modules, alternative intermediate widths, varying expert counts, and enhanced attention positional encodings. Our systematic study reveals that carefully tuning these configurations is essential for unlocking the full potential of Diffusion MoE models, often yielding gains that exceed those achieved by routing innovations alone. Through extensive experiments, we present novel architectures that can be efficiently applied to both latent and pixel-space diffusion frameworks, which provide a practical and efficient training recipe that enables Diffusion MoE models to surpass strong baselines while using equal or fewer activated parameters.

Project page at https://youngsm.com/panda/", "summary": "Liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs) provide dense, high-fidelity 3D measurements of particle interactions and underpin current and future neutrino and rare-event experiments. Physics reconstruction typically relies on complex detector-specific pipelines that use tens of hand-engineered pattern recognition algorithms or cascades of task-specific neural networks that require extensive, labeled simulation that requires a careful, time-consuming calibration process. We introduce \\textbf{Panda}, a model that learns reusable sensor-level representations directly from raw unlabeled LArTPC data. Panda couples a hierarchical sparse 3D encoder with a multi-view, prototype-based self-distillation objective. On a simulated dataset, Panda substantially improves label efficiency and reconstruction quality, beating the previous state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model with 1,000$\\times$ fewer labels.

This structure enables topology-aware densification and pruning, preserving the manifold consistency of the Gaussian representation. Temporal regularization terms further ensure topological coherence over time, while differentiable mesh rasterization improves mesh quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reconstructs topology-consistent mesh sequences with significantly higher accuracy than existing approaches.

However, existing methods often experience substantial performance degradation compared with individually fine-tuned models, even on similar tasks, underscoring the need to preserve task-specific information. This paper proposes Decomposition, Thresholding, and Scaling (DTS), an approximation-based personalized merging framework that preserves task-specific information with minimal storage overhead. DTS first applies singular value decomposition to the task-specific information and retains only a small subset of singular values and vectors. It then introduces a novel thresholding strategy that partitions singular vector elements into groups and assigns a scaling factor to each group. To enable generalization to unseen tasks, we further extend DTS with a variant that fuses task-specific information in a data-free manner based on the semantic similarity of task characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while requiring only 1\\% additional storage per task. Furthermore, experiments on unseen tasks show that the DTS variant achieves significantly better generalization performance.

Existing agents often struggle with robust long-term planning about unseen environments, leading to high failure rates. To address these limitations, we introduce NavForesee, a novel Vision-Language Model (VLM) that unifies high-level language planning and predictive world model imagination within a single, unified framework. Our approach empowers a single VLM to concurrently perform planning and predictive foresight. Conditioned on the full instruction and historical observations, the model is trained to understand the navigation instructions by decomposing the task, tracking its progress, and formulating the subsequent sub-goal. Simultaneously, it functions as a generative world model, providing crucial foresight by predicting short-term environmental dynamics and long-term navigation milestones.

This issue arises due to the model's tendency to overwrite previously acquired knowledge with new information. We present a novel approach to address this challenge, focusing on the intersection of memory-based methods and regularization approaches. We formulate a regularization strategy, termed Information Maximization (IM) regularizer, for memory-based continual learning methods, which is based exclusively on the expected label distribution, thus making it class-agnostic. As a consequence, IM regularizer can be directly integrated into various rehearsal-based continual learning methods, reducing forgetting and favoring faster convergence. Our empirical validation shows that, across datasets and regardless of the number of tasks, our proposed regularization strategy consistently improves baseline performance at the expense of a minimal computational overhead. The lightweight nature of IM ensures that it remains a practical and scalable solution, making it applicable to real-world continual learning scenarios where efficiency is paramount. Finally, we demonstrate the data-agnostic nature of our regularizer by applying it to video data, which presents additional challenges due to its temporal structure and higher memory requirements.

Journal Extension of arXiv:2407.19274", "summary": "Medical image registration drives quantitative analysis across organs, modalities, and patient populations. Recent deep learning methods often combine low-level \"trend-driven\" computational blocks from computer vision, such as large-kernel CNNs, Transformers, and state-space models, with high-level registration-specific designs like motion pyramids, correlation layers, and iterative refinement. Yet, their relative contributions remain unclear and entangled. This raises a central question: should future advances in registration focus on importing generic architectural trends or on refining domain-specific design principles? Through a modular framework spanning brain, lung, cardiac, and abdominal registration, we systematically disentangle the influence of these two paradigms. Our evaluation reveals that low-level \"trend-driven\" computational blocks offer only marginal or inconsistent gains, while high-level registration-specific designs consistently deliver more accurate, smoother, and more robust deformations. These domain priors significantly elevate the performance of a standard U-Net baseline, far more than variants incorporating \"trend-driven\" blocks, achieving an average relative improvement of $\\sim3\\%$. All models and experiments are released within a transparent, modular benchmark that enables plug-and-play comparison for new architectures and registration tasks (https://github.com/BailiangJ/rethink-reg). This dynamic and extensible platform establishes a common ground for reproducible and fair evaluation, inviting the community to isolate genuine methodological contributions from domain priors.

During rollout generation, RoaD incorporates expert guidance to bias trajectories toward high-quality behavior, producing informative yet realistic demonstrations for fine-tuning. This approach enables robust closed-loop adaptation with orders of magnitude less data than reinforcement learning, and avoids restrictive assumptions of prior closed-loop supervised fine-tuning (CL-SFT) methods, allowing broader applications domains including end-to-end driving. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RoaD on WOSAC, a large-scale traffic simulation benchmark, where it performs similar or better than the prior CL-SFT method; and in AlpaSim, a high-fidelity neural reconstruction-based simulator for end-to-end driving, where it improves driving score by 41\\% and reduces collisions by 54\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "RoaD\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u95ed\u73afrollouts\u4f5c\u4e3a\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b56\u7565\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u5f00\u73af\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u9650\u5236\uff08\u5982\u5148\u524d\u7684CL-SFT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u3002", "method": "RoaD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728rollout\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f7f\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u5411\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u95ed\u73afrollouts\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728WOSAC\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4ea4\u901a\u4eff\u771f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRoaD\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u7684CL-SFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u5728AlpaSim\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u795e\u7ecf\u91cd\u5efa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9a7e\u9a76\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u9a7e\u9a76\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad841%\uff0c\u78b0\u649e\u51cf\u5c1154%\u3002", "conclusion": "RoaD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u6bd4\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5c11\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5148\u524dCL-SFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9650\u5236\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5305\u62ec\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9a7e\u9a76\u5728\u5185\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Project Page: https://efficientflow.github.io/", "summary": "Generative modeling has recently shown remarkable promise for visuomotor policy learning, enabling flexible and expressive control across diverse embodied AI tasks. However, existing generative policies often struggle with data inefficiency, requiring large-scale demonstrations, and sampling inefficiency, incurring slow action generation during inference. We introduce EfficientFlow, a unified framework for efficient embodied AI with flow-based policy learning. To enhance data efficiency, we bring equivariance into flow matching. We theoretically prove that when using an isotropic Gaussian prior and an equivariant velocity prediction network, the resulting action distribution remains equivariant, leading to improved generalization and substantially reduced data demands. To accelerate sampling, we propose a novel acceleration regularization strategy. As direct computation of acceleration is intractable for marginal flow trajectories, we derive a novel surrogate loss that enables stable and scalable training using only conditional trajectories. Across a wide range of robotic manipulation benchmarks, the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance under limited data while offering dramatically faster inference. These results highlight EfficientFlow as a powerful and efficient paradigm for high-performance embodied AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "EfficientFlow\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff08\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\uff09\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u6162\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u5177\u8eabAI\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEfficientFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u7b49\u53d8\u901f\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f7f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5e03\u4fdd\u6301\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u52a0\u901f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u66ff\u4ee3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "EfficientFlow\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5177\u8eabAI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u800c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}
