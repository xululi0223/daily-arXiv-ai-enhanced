In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and\nCoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:\ntruthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy.

However, existing methods often lack an\nunderstanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate\nnegative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels\nsignificantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we\npropose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the\nunderstanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative\nimages and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive\nnegative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance\nfar-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the\nin-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that\nare visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning\ncapability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to\nthis subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD\ndetection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an\nadaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task\nsettings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior\nknowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet\nbenchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\\%, establishing a\nnew state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,\nenabling high scalability."}

In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates\nmulti-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted\nFusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from\nre-identification models are highly similar when representing the same\nidentity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to\ngenerate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight\nselection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an\neffective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning\nor extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate\nour method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and\nOccluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves\nRank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking\nresults. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method\nachieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:\nMSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach\ndemonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to\nother re-ranking methods."}

In this\npaper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new\nperspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)\nhuman motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a\nbody-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and\nreason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently\ncompositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation\nvia effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an\nintermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a\nreasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.\nOur method executes in the body-part text space with much higher\ninterpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving\npotential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to\nnew styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive\nexperiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized\nmotion generation."}

Recent\nadvancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented\nphotorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars.\nHowever, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering\nmodels trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their\nability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand,\ngenerative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion\nmodels can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through\nsimple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these\nmethods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific\nrendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth\nwrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths\nof person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable\ndynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic\npose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we\noptimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a\ndynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In\nthe second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network\nweights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time,\ncontrollable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale,\ncross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods."}

This design, dubbed global-to-local,\nstems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only\nbe afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient\nlocal feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular\nenabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are\noften missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based\nre-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In\nthis work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global\nretrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global\nfeature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global\nfeatures are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval\nsimilarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional\nscaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities\nobtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost.\nExperimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new\nstate-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets."}

This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from\nrestrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal\ndynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by\nintroducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically\ndefines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a\nnovel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to\narbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory\nfrom single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having\nonly 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing\nleading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across\nall evaluated step counts.
