Motivation: 老年患者在临床NLP资源中代表性不足，现有研究很少处理不连续和重叠实体的标注挑战。

Method: 构建手动标注语料库，包含14种AE及上下文属性，支持复杂标注。使用FlairNLP评估多种模型在三种标注粒度上的性能。

Result: BERT等模型在粗粒度任务上表现优异（F1=0.943），但在细粒度任务（如罕见事件和复杂属性）上表现较差（F1=0.675）。

Conclusion: 尽管模型在粗粒度任务上表现良好，但在细粒度任务和罕见事件检测上仍需改进。数据集为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE) extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [2] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD) 通过结合约束和非约束解码的两阶段方法，提升结构化NLP任务的输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练时未显式考虑约束，导致测试时约束解码输出质量低。

Method: BoostCD分两阶段：阶段1分别进行约束和非约束解码生成弱预测；阶段2通过自回归增强模型结合两者生成最终预测。

Result: BoostIE在封闭信息提取任务中表现优于现有方法，解决了常见错误。

Conclusion: BoostCD通过结合约束和非约束解码的优势，显著提升了结构化NLP任务的性能。

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training, these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model $M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE, outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing several common errors identified in those approaches.

### [3] [CrEst: Credibility Estimation for Contexts in LLMs via Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14912)
*Dyah Adila,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bonan Min,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CrEst是一种弱监督框架，用于评估LLM推理中上下文文档的可信度，无需人工标注，通过文档间一致性实现自动化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常忽略上下文文档的可信度差异，可能导致不可靠信息的传播。

Method: 提出CrEst框架，基于文档间语义一致性评估可信度，并提供黑盒和白盒两种集成策略。

Result: 在三种模型架构和五个数据集上，CrEst显著优于基线，准确率提升26.86%，F1分数提升3.49%。

Conclusion: CrEst在无监督条件下有效提升LLM推理的可信度，且在高噪声环境下表现稳健。

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

*Joseph J. Peper,Wenzhao Qiu,Ali Payani,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MDBench是一个用于评估大语言模型在多文档推理任务上的新数据集，通过合成生成方法高效创建，挑战性强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准在多文档推理领域不足，且标注成本高，需要新的高效方法。

Method: 采用合成生成技术，基于结构化种子知识，通过LLM辅助编辑生成文档集和问答示例。

Result: MDBench对现有LLM和提示技术均构成显著挑战，即使文档集较短。

Conclusion: MDBench能有效分析多文档推理能力，并快速适应新挑战和模型改进。

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD) reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA) examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge, modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1) allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and future modeling improvements.

### [5] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在糖尿病预测中的效果，比较了零样本、单样本和三样本提示方法，发现专有模型优于开源模型，且Gemma-2-27B在F1分数上超过传统机器学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在结构化数值数据（如糖尿病预测）中的应用潜力，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 使用Pima Indian Diabetes Database（PIDD），评估六种LLMs（四种开源，两种专有）和三种传统机器学习模型，采用零样本、单样本和三样本提示方法，以准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数为指标。

Result: 专有LLMs（如GPT-4o和Gemma-2-27B）表现优于开源模型，Gemma-2-27B在F1分数上超过传统模型，但性能受提示策略影响且需领域微调。

Conclusion: LLMs在医疗预测任务中具有潜力，未来需优化提示工程和混合方法以提升性能。

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably, Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score. However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

### [6] [Memory Tokens: Large Language Models Can Generate Reversible Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15001)
*Ignacio Sastre,Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过引入特殊记忆令牌，可以生成可逆的句子嵌入，使LLM在不修改权重的情况下精确重建原始文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在无需修改权重的情况下精确重建文本的能力，并研究其潜在应用。

Method: 通过训练优化特殊记忆令牌的嵌入，使其在提示时能精确重建固定序列。

Result: 在英语和西班牙语数据集上，模型（包括Llama 3.1 8B）成功重建了长达240个令牌的序列。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM的有趣能力，为基于记忆的检索、压缩和受控文本生成提供了潜在应用。

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

### [7] [Identifying social isolation themes in NVDRS text narratives using topic modeling and text-classification methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15030)
*Drew Walker,Swati Rajwal,Sudeshna Das,Snigdha Peddireddy,Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文利用自然语言处理技术从执法和法医叙述中识别社会隔离和孤独感，开发了高质量分类器，并分析了自杀案例中与社会隔离相关的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会隔离和孤独感近年显著增加，与自杀率密切相关，但目前未被美国国家暴力死亡报告系统（NVDRS）的结构化变量记录。

Method: 使用主题建模生成词典开发，并结合监督学习分类器，分析了2002年至2020年的30万例自杀案例。

Result: 开发了高质量分类器（平均F1：0.86，准确率：0.82），识别出1,198例慢性社会隔离案例，并发现男性、同性恋或离婚者更易被分类为慢性社会隔离。

Conclusion: 该方法可改进美国社会隔离和孤独感的监测与预防。

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over 300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR = 3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001). We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up. Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and loneliness in the United States.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrefBERT是一个用于评估开放式长文本生成的评分模型，通过区分好坏输出的奖励机制改进GRPO训练，优于传统指标ROUGE-L和BERTScore。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估开放式长文本生成时存在不足，如忽略关键方面（连贯性、风格、相关性）或受预训练数据偏见影响。

Method: 提出PrefBERT模型，基于多样长文本风格和质量评分的两个数据集训练，为GRPO提供语义奖励反馈。

Result: PrefBERT在多句子和段落长度响应中表现可靠，与人类偏好一致，优于传统指标。

Conclusion: PrefBERT作为奖励信号训练策略模型，能生成更符合人类偏好的响应。

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality, PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis, we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics.

### [9] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了学习时知识编码对大型语言模型（LLM）事后“遗忘”能力的影响，发现使用转述描述能提升遗忘效果，但从文本块中遗忘单个知识仍具挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在现实中的广泛应用，事后遗忘特定知识的需求日益增长，涉及隐私法规和纠正有害内容等。

Method: 通过实验研究学习时知识编码对遗忘效果的影响，重点关注转述描述和文本块中的知识遗忘。

Result: 发现转述描述能提升遗忘性能，但从文本块中遗忘单个知识较困难。

Conclusion: 学习时的知识编码对实现可靠的事后遗忘至关重要。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world, the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc, has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2) unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging. Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种对话话语解析的增强方法，通过引入DCM和CPO模块，显著提升了解析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话中的语言特征（如省略和习语）常导致话语关系模糊，增加了解析难度。

Method: 提出DCM模块，包含澄清类型推理和话语目标推理；引入CPO优化模块以减少错误澄清。

Result: 在STAC和Molweni数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DCM和CPO能有效解决模糊性，提升对话话语解析性能。

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore, we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大语言模型在医疗知识表示不足和临床部署效率低的问题。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-7B作为教师模型生成软标签，通过多粒度注意力蒸馏机制将知识转移到轻量级BERT学生模型。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上，诊断准确率提升9%，F1分数提高27%，推理速度加快22.2倍。

Conclusion: CKD-EHR显著提升资源利用效率和诊断准确性，为临床资源优化提供实用技术方案。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings.

*Jing Yang Lee,Kong-Aik Lee,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架（MRG和PS）来建模开放域对话的一对多属性，通过新数据集o2mDial和训练策略提升小模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域对话存在一对多属性，现有LLM对话代理未显式建模此属性，导致多样性不足。

Method: 将对话生成分解为多响应生成（MRG）和基于偏好的选择（PS），并引入o2mDial数据集及新训练策略。

Result: 两阶段框架显著提升小模型的响应多样性和质量（最高提升90%），接近大模型表现。

Conclusion: 显式建模一对多属性可有效提升对话代理性能，新框架和数据集为未来研究提供基础。

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity, most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS), which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context. Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

TL;DR: Thunder-Tok是一种新的韩语分词器，通过规则预分词和种子词汇表结合分支熵选择算法，降低分词数量10%，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一种高效的韩语分词器，减少分词数量（降低fertility）而不影响模型性能。

Method: 采用规则预分词方法，结合韩语语言结构；创建种子词汇表并使用分支熵选择算法，增加平均分词长度。

Result: 实验显示，Thunder-Tok比BPE减少10%的分词数量，提升推理速度10%，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: Thunder-Tok证明基于语言学的方法能有效设计高效分词器。

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

TL;DR: 论文通过研究状态空间语言模型中的记忆机制，利用首因效应和近因效应揭示信息保留与遗忘的动态过程，发现Mamba架构在输入序列的首尾表现优异，并揭示了三种机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索状态空间语言模型中信息如何被保留和遗忘，以及首因效应和近因效应的行为表现。

Method: 在Mamba架构上应用结构化回忆任务，分析其U型准确率曲线，并通过针对性消融和输入扰动验证机制。

Result: 发现三种机制：长期记忆由稀疏通道支持，短期记忆受delta调制递归控制，记忆分配受语义规律动态调节。

Conclusion: Mamba架构的记忆机制由多种动态因素共同作用，验证了其在大型模型中的有效性。

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跟踪SDGs进展因数据规模庞大且复杂而困难，文本分类模型和LLMs为此提供了自动化分析工具。

Conclusion: 提示工程可以显著提升小型模型在SDGs文本分类任务中的性能，使其与大型模型媲美。

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030. However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks, including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).

TL;DR: 论文提出ProtoReasoning框架，通过抽象推理原型提升大语言模型的推理能力，实验显示在多领域任务中性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大推理模型跨领域泛化能力的机制，假设共享抽象推理原型是泛化的基础。

Method: 提出ProtoReasoning框架，包括自动化原型构建、验证系统和原型空间扩展能力。

Result: 在逻辑推理、规划任务、通用推理和数学任务上分别提升4.7%、6.3%、4.0%和1.0%。

Conclusion: 验证了推理原型作为大语言模型泛化基础的有效性，并展示了其性能优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally similar problems compared to training solely on natural language representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinosEval是一种新型评估方法，针对开放性问题回答（QA）任务，通过区分事实性和非事实性问题，分别采用自适应关键点评分和实例感知列表排序策略，提升评估的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放性问题回答（QA）对大型语言模型（LLM）的能力评估至关重要，但传统评估指标（如ROUGE和BERTScore）难以捕捉语义相似性，且现有LLM评估方法缺乏直观可解释性。此外，现有方法未区分事实性和非事实性问题。

Method: MinosEval首先区分问题类型：对事实性问题采用自适应关键点评分策略，对非事实性问题采用实例感知列表排序策略。

Result: 在多个开放QA数据集上的实验表明，MinosEval与人工标注更一致，并提供更可解释的结果。

Conclusion: MinosEval通过针对性策略解决了开放QA评估的挑战，显著提升了评估的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets, including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers more interpretable results.

Motivation: 研究当前语言技术对不同语言变体的理解能力，特别是巴斯克语和西班牙语。

Method: 使用自然语言推理（NLI）任务，构建了一个新的并行数据集，并通过编码器-解码器大语言模型进行跨语言和上下文学习实验。

Result: 实验显示语言变体（尤其是巴斯克语）导致性能下降，且编码器模型对西巴斯克语表现较差。

Conclusion: 语言变体本身（而非词汇重叠）是性能下降的主要原因，西巴斯克语的困难与语言学理论一致。

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants. Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque. Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque, which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g., Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly available.

Conclusion: Graph RAG框架为古典文本知识提取提供了低资源解决方案，推动了历史知识服务和人文研究的进步。

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction, reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B, with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12), effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and humanities research.

Conclusion: 基于聚类的上下文过滤和提示聚合在大规模RAG系统中有效。

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model (LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence. Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation in large-scale RAG systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Thunder-DeID的去标识化框架，用于解决韩国法院判决公开中个人数据保护与法律要求之间的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前韩国法院判决的去标识化过程无法满足大规模处理的需求，且法律对个人标识的定义模糊，缺乏技术支持。

Method: 构建首个韩国法律数据集，系统分类个人可识别信息（PII），并开发基于深度神经网络的端到端去标识化流程。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在法院判决去标识化任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID框架有效解决了法律与技术之间的脱节问题，为大规模去标识化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the de-identification of court judgments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用NLP任务中表现优异，但在关键领域（如临床试验招募）的应用仍有限。LLMs的知识聚合与推理能力有望解决传统方法的局限性。

Method: 综述了LLM辅助方法在试验-患者匹配任务中的应用，并分析了现有基准和评估框架。

Result: 指出现有方法依赖专有模型和弱评估基准，需改进。

Conclusion: LLMs在临床研究中潜力巨大，但需解决技术和评估挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet, their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言在语言识别中表现不佳，主要由于训练数据单一（如圣经等单领域数据），导致领域偏差和类别不平衡问题。

Method: 采用监督对比学习（SCL）方法，学习低资源语言的领域不变表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将低资源语言在跨领域数据上的LID性能提升了3.2%。

Conclusion: 提出的SCL方法有效解决了低资源语言在LID中的领域偏差问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Motivation: 当前评估方法难以区分LLMs的真实医学推理与表面模式，需开发更精细的测试框架。

Method: 构建ICU出院笔记数据集（MIMIC-IV），生成真实和模板版本，评估五类LLMs的输入敏感性和下游推理能力。

Result: 零样本模型在反事实推理上更一致，微调模型更稳定但对临床变化响应较弱；人口因素对输出有持续影响。

Conclusion: 行为测试有助于揭示临床LLMs的推理策略，促进更安全、透明的医疗AI设计。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Motivation: 语言模型在全球应用中的有效性依赖于对本地社会文化背景的理解，但目前缺乏针对印度文化多样性的评估工具。

Method: 通过构建SANSKRITI数据集，涵盖印度文化的16个关键属性，并对主流语言模型进行评估。

Result: 评估发现主流语言模型在处理印度文化相关查询时存在显著差异，许多模型在地区特定情境下表现不佳。

Conclusion: SANSKRITI为评估和改进语言模型的文化理解能力设定了新标准。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity. Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language, art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive, culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

Conclusion: COSMMIC为印度语言的NLP研究提供了宝贵资源，推动了多模态和多语言任务的包容性发展。

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and (4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images, and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TLI（Targeted Lexical Injection）的高效微调方法，通过利用低资源语言模型早期层的强词对齐能力，显著提升了Swahili-English的词对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言（如Swahili）在大型语言模型中的表现较差，主要由于数据稀缺和预训练中的代表性不足。词对齐是跨语言任务（如翻译和信息检索）的关键挑战。

Method: TLI方法利用Low-Rank Adaptation（LoRA）和对比学习目标，针对模型早期层（如Layer 2）的词嵌入进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，TLI显著提升了623个Swahili-English词对的词对齐效果（平均余弦相似度从0.3211提升至0.4113），且对未见的63个词对也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TLI通过参数高效的方式增强了模型在低资源语言中的词对齐能力，为跨语言任务提供了有效策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach. We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set). TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17 x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in LRL-focused LLMs.

Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在GUI代理中表现出色，但其存在系统性定位错误（幻觉），影响可靠性。需要更细致的评估和改进方法。

Method: 1. 提出细粒度评估框架，将预测分为四类；2. 引入PSS指标量化不确定性；3. 提出Context-Aware Cropping技术优化输入上下文。

Result: 实验表明，框架和方法提升了GUI代理的可解释性和鲁棒性，并提供了可操作的改进建议。

Conclusion: 提出的评估框架和PSS指标能有效识别模型失败模式，Context-Aware Cropping技术显著提升性能，为GUI代理的可靠性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However, current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design, cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition. Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME (nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty, particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient, general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex reasoning scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs的高准确率是否源于真实推理能力，还是仅依赖训练数据的统计记忆。

Method: 提出RE-IMAGINE框架，生成符号化的问题变体，测试LLMs在不同推理层次（关联、干预、反事实）的表现。

Result: LLMs在问题变体上的表现下降，表明其部分依赖统计记忆。

Conclusion: RE-IMAGINE为评估LLMs的真实推理能力提供了通用工具，并揭示了其局限性。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations, interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation, RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs, and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

TL;DR: CINGS是一种后训练监督方法，通过在响应前添加相关上下文并仅计算响应标记的损失，显著提升了LLM在文本和视觉领域的接地性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时简单附加上下文无法确保生成的响应接地，需要一种更有效的方法来提升模型的接地能力。

Method: 提出CINGS方法，训练时将相关上下文预置到响应前，计算损失时仅考虑响应标记并屏蔽上下文。

Result: CINGS在11个信息检索数据集上优于其他方法，视觉领域减少幻觉并保持事实一致性，且不影响下游性能。

Conclusion: CINGS通过改变模型对先验知识的依赖，隐式鼓励更多依赖外部上下文，显著提升接地性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11 information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response. This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external context.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains: mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime, compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research and reproducibility.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于情感引导的双向动态交互框架（EmoBi），用于检测夸张和隐喻，通过情感分析和双向交互提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夸张和隐喻在自然语言处理中具有重要意义，但由于其语义模糊和表达多样，检测具有挑战性。现有方法多关注表层特征，忽略了情感关联和双向交互的作用。

Method: EmoBi框架包含情感分析模块、基于情感的领域映射模块和双向动态交互模块，通过情感挖掘和双向交互提升检测准确性。

Result: 实验表明，EmoBi在四个数据集上优于基线方法，F1分数在TroFi数据集上提升28.1%（夸张检测），在HYPO-L数据集上提升23.1%（隐喻检测）。

Conclusion: EmoBi框架通过情感引导和双向交互显著提升了夸张和隐喻的检测性能，具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them. Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses, we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor. Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets. Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and metaphor detection.

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合推理、分阶段优化和基于结果的强化学习，可以构建更可验证和可靠的大语言模型。

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers, citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal, further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

*Bailin Wang,Chang Lan,Chong Wang,Ruoming Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RATTENTION是一种结合局部注意力和线性注意力的新方法，旨在解决局部注意力忽视窗口外标记的问题，提升短上下文场景下的效率与性能平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决局部注意力模型完全忽视窗口外标记的内在限制，提升短上下文场景下的效率与性能。

Method: 提出RATTENTION，结合局部注意力和线性注意力机制，捕获窗口外标记信息。

Result: 在3B和12B规模的预训练实验中，RATTENTION以512窗口大小匹配全注意力模型性能，并在长上下文任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: RATTENTION在保持训练效率的同时，显著提升了局部注意力模型的性能与效率平衡。

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现代语言模型通常公开权重但封闭训练数据，研究旨在解决从模型权重近似训练数据的问题。

Method: 采用基于梯度的方法，从大型公共文本库中选择匹配度最高的数据，并在分类和监督微调任务中验证其有效性。

Result: 在AG News分类任务中，性能从65%提升至80%；在MSMARCO微调任务中，困惑度从3.3降至2.3。

Conclusion: 该方法能从模型权重中有效恢复有用数据，显著提升模型性能，接近专家基准。

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task, our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%, approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3, compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在实时语音聊天中因生成第一句话的延迟导致音频输出滞后，影响用户体验，尤其是在计算能力有限的设备上。

Method: 提出PredGen框架，利用预测性解码在用户说话时生成候选响应，提前启动TTS处理以减少延迟。

Result: 在Lmsys和MT-Bench数据集上的模拟实验显示，PredGen可将延迟降低约2倍，且额外计算成本极低。

Conclusion: PredGen有效解决了LLMs在实时语音聊天中的延迟问题，显著提升了用户体验，且计算成本可控。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence, which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation that would otherwise go unused.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注二元性别区分，缺乏对非二元性别包容性的评估。本文旨在填补这一空白，推动LLMs在性别公平性方面的进步。

Method: 引入GIFI指标，从多个层面评估LLMs的性别包容性，包括代词使用、生成内容和认知行为等。对22种不同规模和能力的LLMs进行了广泛测试。

Result: 发现不同LLMs在性别包容性上存在显著差异，揭示了与不同性别标识相关的偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提升LLMs性别包容性的重要性，为未来生成模型的性别公平性提供了重要基准。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions, we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs. GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的任务DiscoSG，用于解析多句视觉描述的语篇级场景图，并发布了数据集DiscoSG-DS。通过DiscoSG-Refiner方法，结合两个小型PLM，显著提升了性能并降低了推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本场景图解析器主要针对单句描述，无法有效处理多句语篇中的跨句共指等现象，导致图结构碎片化和下游任务性能下降。

Method: 提出DiscoSG-Refiner方法，先用一个小型PLM生成基础图，再用另一个PLM迭代提出图编辑建议，减少全图生成的开销。

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner在SPICE指标上比最佳基线提升约30%，推理速度比GPT-4快86倍，并显著提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: DiscoSG-Refiner是一种高效且性能优越的语篇级场景图解析方法，适用于开源环境，并能有效支持下游VLM任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9 sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline, high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/ShaoqLin/DiscoSG

Method: 提出WikiMixQA基准测试，包含1000道多选题，覆盖7个主题的4000个维基百科页面，要求模型综合多模态信息进行推理。评估了12种先进视觉语言模型。

Result: 专有模型在直接上下文提供时准确率约70%，但在长文档检索时性能显著下降。GPT-4-o是唯一超过50%准确率的模型，开源模型最高仅27%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了长上下文多模态推理的挑战，WikiMixQA将成为推动文档理解研究的重要基准。

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics. Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context, multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for advancing document understanding research.

Result: 模型生成的MCQ质量接近人工创作，但在语义清晰度和干扰项设计上存在问题。

Conclusion: 当前模型能生成高质量MCQ，但需改进语义清晰度和干扰项设计，以更好地满足实际应用需求。

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention -- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

Result: 实验成功识别了最优后悔表示层，并发现神经元分为三类：后悔神经元、非后悔神经元和双功能神经元。

Conclusion: 研究为理解后悔机制提供了方法论和实证基础，有助于模型优化和认知研究。

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks. To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases. Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

Method: 通过三个实验研究英式和美式英语使用者对强化词的理解，并开发计算认知模型分析听者对说话者权衡信息性、礼貌和话语成本的递归推理。

Result: 模型比较表明，强化词的跨文化差异源于字面意义和话语成本权重的组合。

Conclusion: 跨文化理解差异是字面意义与语用因素复杂互动的结果，挑战了仅基于语义或礼貌规范的解释。

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper, we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity, politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

Motivation: 研究LLM在生成任务中遵循指定概念顺序的能力，评估其组合泛化和指令遵循能力。

Method: 提出Ordered CommonGen基准，通过有序覆盖率评估LLM的表现，并对36种LLM进行全面分析。

Conclusion: LLM在指令遵循和组合泛化能力上仍需改进，Ordered CommonGen为未来研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts. However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36 LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about 75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

Result: ANN模型表现最佳，5-gram特征下四次达到完美分类。

Conclusion: 轻量级字符n-gram方法在罗马尼亚作者归属任务中可达到先进水平，适用于资源受限或研究不足的语言。

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of authorship attribution for Romanian texts using the ROST corpus, a standard benchmark in the field. We systematically evaluate six machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen runs when using 5-gram features. These results demonstrate that lightweight, interpretable character n-gram approaches can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods. Our findings highlight the potential of simple stylometric features in resource, constrained or under-studied language settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理任务中表现不稳定，需要一种方法提升其一致性和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用基于队列的一致性学习（CC-Learn），结合队列准确性、检索奖励和拒绝惩罚的复合目标，通过强化学习优化。

Result: 在ARC-Challenge和StrategyQA等基准测试中，CC-Learn显著提升了模型的准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 队列级强化学习能有效增强LLM的推理一致性。

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent, robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning. Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks (including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning consistency in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型推理模型的推理痕迹中存在隐私泄露风险，即使最终输出安全，内部推理过程也可能泄露敏感数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战推理痕迹内部安全的假设，揭示其可能泄露用户敏感数据的风险。

Method: 通过提示注入和代理评估，研究测试时计算（如增加推理步骤）对隐私泄露的影响。

Result: 增加推理步骤虽使模型更谨慎，但也导致更详细的推理痕迹，从而扩大隐私攻击面。

Conclusion: 安全措施需扩展到模型的内部推理过程，而不仅是最终输出。

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches, particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决性别包容性机器翻译中保持性别模糊性的挑战，避免误判性别和代表性伤害。

Method: 评估21种机器翻译系统在三种翻译方向中对性别模糊性的敏感度，分类并讨论实际观察到的性别中立策略。

Result: 大多数系统未能提供性别中立翻译，仅少数系统根据目标语言采用特定策略实现。

Conclusion: 性别中立翻译在机器翻译中仍显不足，但部分系统展示了可行的策略。

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English, maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific strategies, depending on the target language.

Conclusion: GenRecal为跨架构VLM知识蒸馏提供了通用解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios, particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size, token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs.

Conclusion: PhantomHunter能有效检测私有调优LLM生成的文本，为解决LLM生成文本检测的新挑战提供了可行方案。

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance. Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora, resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice. To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores of over 96%.

Experiments on a publicly available multimodal irony detection benchmark dataset show that the accuracy and F1 value of this model are improved by 1.64% and 2.88% to 88.87% and 86.33%, respectively, compared with the existing optimal methods. Further ablation experiments verify the important role of knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection in improving the model performance.

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured, human-interpretable queries.

Conclusion: GraphGSOcc模型有效提升3D语义占据预测的准确性和效率，为自动驾驶提供更优解决方案。

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS) methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB, demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to GaussianWorld

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms, the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However, the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level, temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization, temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated video content.

Conclusion: MonoVQD不仅提升了单目3D检测性能，其核心组件还可推广到其他架构，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions. First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities. While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose {ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction. First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of structured instructions: description and difference. The description instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement, enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

Conclusion: PictSure通过优化嵌入模型，在跨域少样本分类任务中表现优异，同时保持域内任务的可比性能。

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings. In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核大小选择对CNN的性能至关重要，但常被忽视。本文旨在通过理论支持和实证验证，优化核大小选择。

Method: 结合信息论、信号处理和学习理论，提出BKSEF框架，平衡信息增益、计算效率和精度提升。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，BKSEF指导的模型精度提升3.1%，FLOPs减少42.8%。实际案例验证了其在医疗图像和交通标志识别中的有效性。

Conclusion: BKSEF为CNN设计提供了理论和实践支持，核大小可作为可优化参数，适用于神经架构搜索和实时系统。

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels. Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems, offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统零售视频标注依赖人工，耗时且成本高，需要一种自动化解决方案。

Method: 利用深度神经网络学习视频帧特征，结合零售环境定制的对象检测技术，实现关键帧自动识别和标注。

Result: 实验表明，该方法标注准确率接近人工标注，效率提升2倍，且仅需人工验证5%的帧。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了零售视频标注的时间和成本，适用于多种零售应用场景。

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications, including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation. Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks, proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS) for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network, named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods. Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400 times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional training.

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models (LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately 100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically, we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are publicly released.

Conclusion: PeRL在多图像位置推理任务中表现出色，同时保持单图像任务的竞争力，为多模态强化学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving comparable performance on single-image tasks.

Result: 在多个医学图像数据集上的实验表明，FCRE方法优于现有MIA方法。

Conclusion: FCRE方法通过频率选择性策略有效解决了医学图像MIA中的重建误差干扰问题，为隐私风险评估提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns. Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information, remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep learning research in this domain.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering, agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to estimate.

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2) training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching. The project is released at https://github.com/kartta-foundation/mapkurator-palette-doc.

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap. This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer process for the first time.

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation, which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor, and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments. However, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and ambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise diffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a unique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a multi-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision. Furthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial integrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously validated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It achieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively. The proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram segmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in other medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across various medical domains.

TL;DR: ReSeDis任务首次将大规模检索与像素级定位结合，解决了现有技术无法同时处理检索和定位的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉搜索技术要么只能精确定位但假设对象存在于所有测试图像中，要么只能检索相关图像但无法精确定位。ReSeDis旨在统一这两种能力。

Method: 引入ReSeDis任务，结合检索与定位，并设计了一个基准测试和专用指标。使用冻结的视觉语言模型作为零样本基线。

Result: ReSeDis提供了一个端到端的测试平台，展示了未来研究的巨大潜力。

Conclusion: ReSeDis为构建下一代稳健且可扩展的多模态搜索系统提供了现实基础。

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision. Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast, generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and practical adoption, we openly release our code.

Result: 实验证明，PSIC在多个下游任务中有效保护隐私，同时保持图像压缩功能。

Conclusion: PSIC是一种即插即用的隐私保护方案，可无缝集成到现有LIC模型中，实现隐私与感知质量的平衡。

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP) models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

Conclusion: DM-FNet通过两阶段扩散模型和混合损失函数，显著提升了多模态医学图像融合的质量和信息密度。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability. Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness, color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code is available at https://github.com/HeDan-11/DM-FNet.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by 28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar size.

Conclusion: C-AFBiFPN框架有效解决了SAR船舶检测中的关键问题，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing. Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges, including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement and fusion framework named C-AFBiFPN. C-AFBiFPN constructs a Convolutional Feature Enhancement (CFE) module following the backbone network, aiming to enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale feature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions. The experimental results on SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) indicate that the proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets, robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

Conclusion: RA-NeRF在复杂相机轨迹下表现出色，验证了其在场景重建中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories. Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally, RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有COD方法缺乏获取历史背景的明确机制，限制了其在复杂伪装场景中的适应性和有效性。

Method: RetroMem采用两阶段训练范式：学习阶段使用DMA增强多尺度视觉信息捕获能力；回忆阶段通过DMM和IPR利用历史知识与当前样本上下文重建推理模式。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，RetroMem显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: RetroMem通过动态整合历史知识，有效提升了COD的性能，为复杂伪装场景的处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct, update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry 4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for the semiconductor field.

Conclusion: MSNeRV通过多尺度特征融合和视频特定设计，显著提升了INR在视频压缩中的表现。

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7 (Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on 2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization (ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code will be available.

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型为ME分析提供了新方向，ME-STR和ME-VQA任务有望推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize (ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, high-definition (HD) maps and semantic maps in bird's-eye view (BEV) are essential for accurate localization, planning, and decision-making. This paper introduces an enhanced End-to-End model named MapFM for online vectorized HD map generation. We show significantly boost feature representation quality by incorporating powerful foundation model for encoding camera images. To further enrich the model's understanding of the environment and improve prediction quality, we integrate auxiliary prediction heads for semantic segmentation in the BEV representation.

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several state-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

Conclusion: CountVid和VideoCount数据集为开放世界物体计数任务提供了有效解决方案，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and significantly outperforms strong baselines.

Result: 在Saimaa环斑海豹和豹子数据集上，再识别准确率提升达5.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过几何感知的纹理映射，显著提升了在变形图案下的个体再识别性能。

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space, enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards (Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification accuracy.

Result: 在PACS和ImageNet上的实验表明，DDIS优于现有方法，生成更接近训练数据分布的图像。

Conclusion: DDIS通过扩散模型和优化策略，显著提升了数据自由图像合成的性能。

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications, but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data. However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA performance in data-free applications.

Motivation: 在医学影像领域，确保深度学习模型的可靠性至关重要，尤其是需要区分分布外（OOD）样本以避免潜在误诊。现有方法可能无法完全捕捉OOD多样性，因此需要更有效的检测机制。

Conclusion: NERO通过神经元级相关性显著提升了OOD检测能力，为医学影像领域的模型可靠性提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this, we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability. Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection methods.

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets. Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models. Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI generation.

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this, we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE \textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module (Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated utility for downstream medical imaging task.

Conclusion: RaCalNet证明了稀疏监督的可行性，同时提升了深度图的结构一致性和细节保留能力。

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods, producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures. Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%, respectively.

Conclusion: WinWinLay通过创新策略显著提升了布局到图像生成的精确性和真实性。

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core, WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue, non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores, facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity, outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在结构一致性上表现优异，比现有参数高效调优策略提升1.78%，比最先进高分辨率遥感分割方法提升3.44%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效利用未标注数据和保持低参数量，实现了鲁棒的分割效果。

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on 1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery, which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution remote sensing segmentation approaches.

*Di Wang,Shi Li*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图的新型统一框架，用于大规模点云的端到端处理，显著提升了森林地上生物量（AGB）估计的可行性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前定量结构模型（QSM）方法在个体树依赖、高质量点云数据需求和多预处理步骤方面存在局限性，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 通过创新的基于图的流程，无缝集成树分割、叶木分离和3D骨架重建，利用路径和抽象等图操作进行树拓扑推理。

Result: 在多种条件下（如叶覆盖、数据源和空间尺度）验证，表现优异，特别是在叶覆盖场景（约20%相对误差）和低密度ULS数据集（约30%相对误差）。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模AGB估计提供了稳健且可扩展的解决方案，减少了对专业预处理工具的依赖，并确立了ULS作为TLS的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale, non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless, end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

Motivation: 现有基于Stable Diffusion的Real-VSR方法在保持时间一致性时往往牺牲空间细节，导致视觉质量不佳。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出DLoRAL范式，包括CFR模块和两个LoRA分支（C-LoRA和D-LoRA），通过交替优化学习时间一致性和空间细节。

Result: 实验表明DLoRAL在精度和速度上均表现优异。

Conclusion: DLoRAL能够高效且高质量地实现视频恢复，同时保持时间一致性和丰富的空间细节。

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution (Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence, resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at https://github.com/yjsunnn/DLoRAL.

Motivation: 临床中多模态图像配准（如PET-MRI）因模态异质性导致传统无监督方法效果不佳，相似性度量难以捕捉对齐关系。

Method: 提出M2M-Reg框架，利用单模态相似性训练多模态配准模型，引入GradCyCon正则化器促进微分同胚，并支持半监督学习。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上，M2M-Reg的PET-MRI和FA-MRI配准DSC比现有方法高2倍。

Conclusion: M2M-Reg有效解决高度异质多模态配准问题，且无需真实变换或分割掩码，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images. We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only, without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR.

Conclusion: 该方法无需重建，计算高效，适用于大范围场景的实时检测。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

Motivation: 当前的人-物交互生成方法在真实性和物理正确性之间存在权衡，HOIDiNi旨在通过结构化方法解决这一问题。

Method: HOIDiNi将问题分为两个阶段：物体中心阶段（选择手-物接触位置）和人体中心阶段（优化全身动作）。通过DNO在噪声空间中优化。

Result: 在GRAB数据集上的定量、定性和主观评估表明，HOIDiNi在接触准确性、物理有效性和整体质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HOIDiNi能够仅通过文本提示生成复杂且可控的交互动作，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions, including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

Conclusion: 该基准测试为评估和提升大型视觉语言模型在长期记忆和推理任务中的性能提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for improvement.

TL;DR: 研究发现，多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉质量与任务表现之间存在矛盾，图像偏离人类感知的保真度时性能可能提升。作者提出VQ-TTT方法，动态调整输入图像以提升任务表现。

Motivation: 探讨视觉输入质量对MLLMs性能的影响，发现传统视觉质量提升方法不适用，需开发适应性解决方案。

Method: 提出VQ-TTT方法，通过插入可学习低秩核和微调浅层视觉编码器，动态调整输入图像。

Result: VQ-TTT显著提升了所有测试MLLMs和数据集的平均准确率，无需额外数据或模型。

Conclusion: 研究重新定义了MLLMs的“更好”视觉输入，强调需要适应性而非普遍“干净”的图像。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity. Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable, low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content; and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets, VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally ``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在推理时搜索方法上存在计算成本高和低置信度生成未受惩罚的问题，导致幻觉现象频发。

Method: ViMaR采用两阶段推理：第一阶段通过单次遍历选择最佳候选描述；第二阶段选择性优化视觉基础薄弱的片段，并引入边缘惩罚机制抑制低置信度生成。

Conclusion: ViMaR具有灵活性、模块化和可扩展性，为视觉语言模型提供了高效、自改进的推理策略。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving VLM pipelines.

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

However, existing video generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes, and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location, scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

Motivation: 扩散模型生成高质量图像但推理速度慢且计算成本高，现有方法依赖固定启发式规则，加速效果有限且泛化性差。

Result: 在PixArt-alpha等模型上，ECAD显著提升推理速度（2.58x）并优于现有方法（4.47 COCO FID）。

Conclusion: ECAD是一种可扩展且泛化性强的扩散模型加速方法。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable approach for accelerating diffusion inference.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于概率需求图（PDGraph）的LLM应用服务系统Hermes，通过优化调度顺序和预热后端，显著提升了服务效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将LLM应用的资源需求视为黑箱，导致端到端效率低下，无法有效处理动态需求。

Method: 利用PDGraph建模资源需求，应用Gittins策略优化调度顺序，并利用模型在合适时机预热后端。

Result: 实验表明，Hermes能将平均完成时间降低70%以上，P95完成时间降低80%以上。

Conclusion: Hermes通过PDGraph和智能调度策略，显著提升了LLM应用的服务效率。

Abstract: Applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs) contains a series of tasks to address real-world problems with boosted capability, which have dynamic demand volumes on diverse backends. Existing serving systems treat the resource demands of LLM applications as a blackbox, compromising end-to-end efficiency due to improper queuing order and backend warm up latency. We find that the resource demands of LLM applications can be modeled in a general and accurate manner with Probabilistic Demand Graph (PDGraph). We then propose Hermes, which leverages PDGraph for efficient serving of LLM applications. Confronting probabilistic demand description, Hermes applies the Gittins policy to determine the scheduling order that can minimize the average application completion time. It also uses the PDGraph model to help prewarm cold backends at proper moments. Experiments with diverse LLM applications confirm that Hermes can effectively improve the application serving efficiency, reducing the average completion time by over 70% and the P95 completion time by over 80%.

Motivation: 现有LLM缓存技术（如上下文缓存和语义缓存）主要针对聊天机器人设计，无法满足依赖外部数据或环境上下文的代理应用需求。

Method: 从代理执行的规划阶段提取结构化计划模板，通过关键词匹配和轻量级模型适配新任务上下文。

Result: 在多个实际代理应用中，系统平均降低成本46.62%，且性能未受影响。

Conclusion: agentic plan caching为LLM代理服务提供了一种高效且互补现有基础设施的解决方案。

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots, are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

Abstract: Data analysis on massive multi-dimensional data, such as high-resolution large-region time averaging or area averaging for geospatial data, often involves calculations over a significant number of data points. While performing calculations in scalable and flexible distributed or cloud environments is a viable option, a full scan of large data volumes still serves as a computationally intensive bottleneck, leading to significant cost. This paper introduces a generic and comprehensive method to address these computational challenges. This method generates a small, size-tunable supplementary dataset that stores the cumulative sums along specific subset dimensions on top of the raw data. This minor addition unlocks rapid and cheap high-resolution large-region data analysis, making calculations over large numbers of data points feasible with small instances or even microservices in the cloud. This method is general-purpose, but is particularly well-suited for data stored in chunked, cloud-optimized formats and for services running in distributed or cloud environments. We present a Zarr extension proposal to integrate the specifications of this method and facilitate its straightforward implementation in general-purpose software applications. Benchmark tests demonstrate that this method, implemented in Amazon Web services (AWS), significantly outperforms the brute-force approach used in on-premises services. With just 5% supplemental storage, this method achieves a performance that is 3-4 orders of magnitude (~10,000 times) faster than the brute-force approach, while incurring significantly reduced computational costs.

Motivation: 现有I/O库（如HDF5和PnetCDF）在处理大量数据对象或独立创建数据对象时效率低下，尤其是在需要集体调用API和保持元数据一致性的场景下。

Method: 以PnetCDF为实验平台，提出了一种新的文件头格式，包含索引表和元数据块列表，支持独立或集体创建数据对象。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了并行I/O的效率和可扩展性，适用于需要处理大量独立数据对象的科学应用。

Abstract: High-level I/O libraries, such as HDF5 and PnetCDF, are commonly used by large-scale scientific applications to perform I/O tasks in parallel. These I/O libraries store the metadata such as data types and dimensionality along with the raw data in the same files. While these libraries are well-optimized for concurrent access to the raw data, they are designed neither to handle a large number of data objects efficiently nor to create different data objects independently by multiple processes, as they require applications to call data object creation APIs collectively with consistent metadata among all processes. Applications that process data gathered from remote sensors, such as particle collision experiments in high-energy physics, may generate data of different sizes from different sensors and desire to store them as separate data objects. For such applications, the I/O library's requirement on collective data object creation can become very expensive, as the cost of metadata consistency check increases with the metadata volume as well as the number of processes. To address this limitation, using PnetCDF as an experimental platform, we investigate solutions in this paper that abide the netCDF file format, as well as propose a new file header format that enables independent data object creation. The proposed file header consists of two sections, an index table and a list of metadata blocks. The index table contains the reference to the metadata blocks and each block stores metadata of objects that can be created collectively or independently. The new design achieves a scalable performance, cutting data object creation times by up to 582x when running on 4096 MPI processes to create 5,684,800 data objects in parallel. Additionally, the new method reduces the memory footprints, with each process requiring an amount of memory space inversely proportional to the number of processes.

TL;DR: eLLM提出了一种弹性内存管理框架，通过虚拟张量抽象和动态内存调整，显著提升了大型语言模型的内存利用率和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM服务系统在运行时内存和KV缓存管理上存在隔离，导致内存利用率低和吞吐量下降。

Method: eLLM采用虚拟张量抽象、弹性内存机制和轻量级调度策略，统一管理内存并动态调整分配。

Result: eLLM在解码吞吐量上比现有系统高2.32倍，支持128K-token输入的批量大小增加3倍。

Conclusion: eLLM通过弹性内存管理有效解决了动态工作负载下的内存挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly being deployed in datacenters. Serving these models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes static weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches. While static weights are constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV caches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for efficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle runtime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory management relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a page table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction. This virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory fragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime memory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization under dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput.
  To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management framework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating systems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction, which decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU memory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory Mechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory inflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3) a Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize memory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under stringent SLO constraints. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that eLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems, 2.32x higher decoding throughput, and supporting 3x larger batch sizes for 128K-token inputs.

Conclusion: RISC-V加速器在HPC中具有潜力，尤其在功耗和能耗方面表现优异。

Abstract: Whilst numerous areas of computing have adopted the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) wholesale in recent years, it is yet to become widespread in HPC. RISC-V accelerators offer a compelling option where the HPC community can benefit from the specialisation offered by the open nature of the standard but without the extensive ecosystem changes required when adopting RISC-V CPUs. In this paper we explore porting the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm to the Tenstorrent Wormhole PCIe RISC-V based accelerator. Built upon Tenstorrent's Tensix architecture, this technology decouples the movement of data from compute, potentially offering increased control to the programmer. Exploring different optimisation techniques to address the bottlenecks inherent in data movement, we demonstrate that for a 2D FFT whilst the Wormhole n300 is slower than a server-grade 24-core Xeon Platinum CPU, the Wormhole draws around 8 times less power and consumes around 2.8 times less energy than the CPU when computing the Fourier transform.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of three dominant parallel programming models in High Performance Computing (HPC): Message Passing Interface (MPI), Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP), and Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). Selecting optimal programming approaches for modern heterogeneous HPC architectures has become increasingly critical. We systematically analyze these models across multiple dimensions: architectural foundations, performance characteristics, domain-specific suitability, programming complexity, and recent advancements. We examine each model's strengths, weaknesses, and optimization techniques. Our investigation demonstrates that MPI excels in distributed memory environments with near-linear scalability for communication-intensive applications, but faces communication overhead challenges. OpenMP provides strong performance and usability in shared-memory systems and loop-centric tasks, though it is limited by shared memory contention. CUDA offers substantial performance gains for data-parallel GPU workloads, but is restricted to NVIDIA GPUs and requires specialized expertise. Performance evaluations across scientific simulations, machine learning, and data analytics reveal that hybrid approaches combining two or more models often yield optimal results in heterogeneous environments. The paper also discusses implementation challenges, optimization best practices, and emerging trends such as performance portability frameworks, task-based programming, and the convergence of HPC and Big Data. This research helps developers and researchers make informed decisions when selecting programming models for modern HPC applications, emphasizing that the best choice depends on application requirements, hardware, and development constraints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低LLM训练成本并实现模型民主化，但节点故障和调度策略导致阶段丢失，传统恢复方法（如检查点和冗余计算）开销大且扩展性差。

Method: CheckFree通过加权平均邻近阶段替代失败阶段；CheckFree+结合乱序流水线执行，支持首尾阶段恢复，并复制嵌入层到邻近阶段。

Result: 在低至中等故障率（5-10%）下，CheckFree和CheckFree+在收敛时间上优于传统方法12%以上。

Conclusion: CheckFree和CheckFree+提供了一种高效、低开销的故障恢复方案，适用于大规模模型训练。

Abstract: Training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy computation nodes, e.g., multiple on-spot instances, lowers the training cost and enables model democratization. The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose, CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However, because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+ with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates (5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our proposals can be run via our code available at: https://github.com/gensyn-ai/CheckFree.

Conclusion: 研究为三维对称张量计算提供了通信效率的理论和实践基础。

Abstract: In this article, we focus on the parallel communication cost of multiplying the same vector along two modes of a $3$-dimensional symmetric tensor. This is a key computation in the higher-order power method for determining eigenpairs of a $3$-dimensional symmetric tensor and in gradient-based methods for computing a symmetric CP decomposition. We establish communication lower bounds that determine how much data movement is required to perform the specified computation in parallel. The core idea of the proof relies on extending a key geometric inequality for $3$-dimensional symmetric computations. We demonstrate that the communication lower bounds are tight by presenting an optimal algorithm where the data distribution is a natural extension of the triangle block partition scheme for symmetric matrices to 3-dimensional symmetric tensors.

Abstract: Parallel computing with multiple GPUs has become the dominant paradigm for machine learning tasks, especially those of large language models (LLMs). To reduce the latency incurred by inter-GPU communication, a common practice for parallel tasks has been to allocate GPUs based on their physical proximity. However, this long-standing assumption has notable limitations, particularly in large-scale, heterogeneous GPU clusters where bandwidth distribution among GPUs is irregular. In this paper, we introduce LiteGD, a lightweight and dynamic GPU dispatching system based on global perspectives. To tackle the difficulty of storing massive GPU topology information, LiteGD adopts a computation-aware design that leverages a lightweight Transformer network trained on sampled data. Our customized design for network structure ensures both transferability and scalability. LiteGD also employs a bidirectional tree search approach to find the optimal GPU dispatching in the data generated in the previous step, which can identify near-optimal solutions while reducing search overhead. We implement and evaluate LiteGD in both real and simulated GPU clusters with homogeneous and heterogeneous interconnects, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that LiteGD consistently achieves high GPU bandwidth efficacy (approximately 90\%) across various cluster configurations and 80\% in real-world H100 cluster, significantly outperforming conventional default and interconnect topology-aware dispatching methods, particularly in large-scale heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: The explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) - such as GPT-4 with 1.8 trillion parameters - demands a radical rethinking of data center architecture to ensure scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Our work provides a comprehensive co-design framework that jointly explores FLOPS, HBM bandwidth and capacity, multiple network topologies (two-tier vs. FullFlat optical), the size of the scale-out domain, and popular parallelism/optimization strategies used in LLMs. We introduce and evaluate FullFlat network architectures, which provide uniform high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity between all nodes, and demonstrate their transformative impact on performance and scalability. Through detailed sensitivity analyses, we quantify the benefits of overlapping compute and communication, leveraging hardware-accelerated collectives, wider scale-out domains, and larger memory capacity. Our study spans both sparse (mixture of experts) and dense transformer-based LLMs, revealing how system design choices affect Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU = Model flops per token x Observed tokens per sec / Peak flops of the hardware) and overall throughput. For the co-design study, we extended and validated a performance modeling tool capable of predicting LLM runtime within 10% of real-world measurements. Our findings offer actionable insights and a practical roadmap for designing AI data centers that can efficiently support trillion-parameter models, reduce optimization complexity, and sustain the rapid evolution of AI capabilities.

Abstract: As the complexity of integrated circuit designs continues to escalate, the functional verification becomes increasingly challenging. Reference models, critical for accelerating the verification process, are themselves becoming more intricate and time-consuming to develop. Despite the promise shown by large language models (LLMs) in code programming, effectively generating complex reference models remains a significant hurdle. To address these challenges, we introduce ChatModel, the first LLM-aided agile reference model generation and verification platform. ChatModel streamlines the transition from design specifications to fully functional reference models by integrating design standardization and hierarchical agile modeling. Employing a building-block generation strategy, it not only enhances the design capabilities of LLMs for reference models but also significantly boosts verification efficiency. We evaluated ChatModel on 300 designs of varying complexity, demonstrating substantial improvements in both efficiency and quality of reference model generation. ChatModel achieved a peak performance improvement of 55.02% compared to alternative methods, with notable enhancements in generation stability, and delivered a 9.18x increase in its capacity to produce reference model designs. Furthermore, it accelerated the iterative process of reference model design and validation by an average of 5.90x compared to traditional approaches. These results highlight the potential of ChatModel to significantly advance the automation of reference model generation and validation.

Abstract: Developing accurate and reliable Compute-In-Memory (CIM) architectures is becoming a key research focus to accelerate Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks on hardware, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In that regard, there has been significant interest in analog and mixed-signal CIM architectures aimed at increasing the efficiency of data storage and computation to handle the massive amount of data needed by DNNs. Specifically, resistive mixed-signal CIM cores are pushed by recent progresses in emerging Non-Volatile Memory (eNVM) solutions. Yet, mixed-signal CIM computing cores still face several integration and reliability challenges that hinder their large-scale adoption into end-to-end AI computing systems. In terms of integration, resistive and eNVM-based CIM cores need to be integrated with a control processor to realize end-to-end AI acceleration. Moreover, SRAM-based CIM architectures are still more efficient and easier to program than their eNVM counterparts. In terms of reliability, analog circuits are more susceptible to variations, leading to computation errors and degraded accuracy. This work addresses these two challenges by proposing a self-calibrated mixed-signal CIM accelerator SoC, fabricated in 22-nm FDSOI technology. The integration is facilitated by (1) the CIM architecture, combining the density and ease of SRAM-based weight storage with multi-bit computation using linear resistors, and (2) an open-source programming and testing strategy for CIM systems. The accuracy and reliability are enabled through an automated RISC-V controlled on-chip calibration, allowing us to improve the compute SNR by 25 to 45% across multiple columns to reach 18-24 dB. To showcase further integration possibilities, we show how our proof-of-concept SoC can be extended to recent high-density linear resistor technologies for enhanced computing performance.

Result: CXL-SSD性能比PCIe内存扩展器高10.9倍，注释机制进一步降低延迟5.4倍；高局部性工作负载下接近DRAM性能。

Conclusion: CXL-SSD展示了块存储与CXL生态集成的可行性，为未来内存-存储融合奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper explores how Compute Express Link (CXL) can transform PCIe-based block storage into a scalable, byte-addressable working memory. We address the challenges of adapting block storage to CXL's memory-centric model by emphasizing cacheability as a key enabler and advocating for Type 3 endpoint devices, referred to as CXL-SSDs. To validate our approach, we prototype a CXL-SSD on a custom FPGA platform and propose annotation mechanisms, Determinism and Bufferability, to enhance performance while preserving data persistency. Our simulation-based evaluation demonstrates that CXL-SSD achieves 10.9x better performance than PCIe-based memory expanders and further reduces latency by 5.4x with annotation enhancements. In workloads with high locality, CXL-SSD approaches DRAM-like performance due to efficient on-chip caching. This work highlights the feasibility of integrating block storage into CXL's ecosystem and provides a foundation for future memory-storage convergence.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对360°视频的超分辨率方法S3PO，解决了传统VSR技术无法处理360°视频失真的问题，并创建了新的数据集360VDS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360°视频在VR中广泛应用，但分辨率不足影响视觉质量，且缺乏相关数据集和针对失真的超分辨率技术。

Method: 提出S3PO模型，采用循环建模和注意力机制，结合专用特征提取器和新型损失函数处理球形失真。

Result: S3PO在360°视频数据集上表现优于现有VSR模型和360°专用超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: S3PO为360°视频超分辨率提供了有效解决方案，并通过消融研究验证了其设计合理性。

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360° videos) are widely used in Virtual Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences. However, the limited spatial resolution in 360° videos does not allow for each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360° video signals. An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360° video datasets for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360° Video Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models to 360° videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model for 360° Video Super-Resolution (360° VSR), called Spherical Signal Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360°~specific super-resolution models on 360° video datasets. A step-wise ablation study is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

Motivation: 数据可视化库的准确性对用户体验和决策至关重要，但其中的视觉错误可能导致信息失真和错误决策。目前缺乏对这类错误的系统性研究，因此有必要深入分析其特点和根源。

Method: 研究收集了五个广泛使用的DataViz库中的564个错误，系统分析了其症状和根本原因，并提出了分类。此外，还探索了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在检测错误可视化中的效果。

Result: 研究发现不准确的可视化在DataViz库中普遍存在，图形计算错误是主要原因。VLMs在检测错误时的效果为29%至57%，且提示信息的增加不一定提高效果。

Conclusion: 研究为DataViz库的错误检测和修复提供了重要见解，并提出了未来自动化测试技术的设计方向。

Abstract: Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation, data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz libraries.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause, which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries. Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%, depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our manuscript.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合双向GRU和多头注意力机制的混合模型（BiGRU-MHA），用于SSD健康状态预测，提高了分类准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSD健康状态预测对数据可靠性至关重要，但传统模型存在泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 模型结合BiGRU的时间特征提取能力和多头注意力机制的关键信息聚焦能力，动态分配特征权重。

Result: 实验显示模型在训练集和测试集上的分类准确率分别为92.70%和92.44%，AUC为0.94，泛化能力优异。

Conclusion: 该模型为SSD健康预测提供了新方法，能显著降低数据丢失风险并优化维护成本，适用于云计算和边缘存储环境。

Abstract: Aiming at the critical role of SSD health state prediction in data reliability assurance, this study proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model that incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and stability of storage device health classification. The model innovatively integrates temporal feature extraction and key information focusing capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%, demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud computing data centers and edge storage environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习在垂直联邦学习（VFL）中更具适应性，但数据异步到达和非凸模型的挑战尚未被充分研究。

Method: 提出事件驱动的在线VFL框架，仅激活部分客户端，并引入动态局部遗憾（DLR）处理非凸和非平稳环境。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在非平稳数据下更稳定，显著降低了通信和计算成本。

Conclusion: 该框架为在线VFL提供了高效且稳定的解决方案，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL, where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated \emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication and computation costs.

Conclusion: 论文填补了联邦学习在拜占庭行为下鲁棒性研究的空白，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and $d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a $\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

Motivation: 训练稳健的BrainAGE模型需要大量数据，但隐私问题限制了数据共享。联邦学习（FL）可以在不集中数据的情况下实现准确的预测。

Method: 使用1674名卒中患者的FLAIR脑图像，比较了集中学习、联邦学习和单点学习的性能，并分析了BrainAGE与血管风险因素及功能结果的关系。

Result: 联邦学习在性能上优于单点学习，且BrainAGE与糖尿病等血管风险因素显著相关，对卒中后功能恢复有预测价值。

Conclusion: 联邦学习无需数据集中即可实现准确的脑年龄预测，BrainAGE与卒中后恢复的关联表明其在预后模型中的潜力。

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns. This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies: centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity, time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models. Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors, and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in stroke care.

Result: 在BLEU和Rouge分数上表现优越，情感分类F1分数提升10%，且能处理多源数据。

Conclusion: ETS框架在开放词汇EEG到文本系统中具有高性能潜力。

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1) open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型预训练中计算8位权重的成本极高（10^13-10^15 FLOPs），效率低下。为了充分利用预训练模型的资源，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 通过AoE方法，在线性时间内对父模型的权重张量进行插值，增强或抑制其语义特征。通过调整父模型权重的比例，生成功能强大的子模型。

Result: 生成的DeepSeek R1T "Chimera"模型结合了两种父模型的优势，性能接近R1模型，但输出令牌减少40%，推理更紧凑有序。

Conclusion: AoE方法能够高效生成功能强大的子模型，无需微调或蒸馏，为模型复用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new "Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed. Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

Motivation: 当前强化学习（RL）在大型语言模型（LLM）推理中的应用主要集中在数学和代码领域，限制了对其更广泛适用性的理解。缺乏跨领域可靠且可扩展的RL奖励信号是关键挑战。

Method: 通过构建Guru语料库（包含六个领域的92K示例），采用领域特定的奖励设计、去重和过滤，确保RL训练的可靠性和有效性。基于此，系统研究了RL在LLM推理中的表现。

Result: 研究发现，RL在不同领域的表现存在显著差异：预训练中常见的领域（如数学、代码、科学）容易受益于跨领域RL训练，而预训练中较少涉及的领域（如逻辑、模拟和表格）需要领域内训练才能取得显著性能提升。Guru-7B和Guru-32B模型在公开数据训练的模型中表现最佳。

Conclusion: RL不仅能够激发预训练模型中的已有知识，还能促进新技能的获取。Guru语料库和模型为通用推理提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code, Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by 7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining data.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决μP理论在词汇量远大于宽度时的局限性，探索词汇量对训练动态的影响。

Method: 通过理论分析词汇量对训练动态的影响，提出LV机制，并通过实验验证新的嵌入学习率缩放规则。

Result: 发现词汇量增大时，嵌入学习率与隐藏学习率的最优比例应为Θ(√width)，与μP预测的Θ(width)不同。

Conclusion: 结论是词汇量对训练动态有显著影响，新的缩放规则在实验中表现优于μP预测的规则。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side, $μP$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for larger models without additional tuning. While $μ$P showed impressive results in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $μ$P is the fact that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics \emph{interpolate between the $μ$P regime and another regime that we call Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those predicted by $μ$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $Θ(\sqrt{width})$, surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the literature, and different from the $Θ(width)$ ratio predicted by $μ$P. We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the embedding LR.

Result: 单层模型无法利用未标记数据，而多层或循环模型能有效利用未标记数据，其性能随深度指数增长。

Conclusion: 通过循环现成的表格基础模型，显著提升了半监督学习性能。

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning. Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning performance over the standard single pass inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征描述方法假设神经元是单义的（monosemantic），而实际上神经元常是多义的（polysemantic），这限制了描述的全面性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了PRISM框架，能够为多义和单义特征提供更细致的描述。

Result: 在语言模型上应用PRISM，通过基准测试证明其描述更准确、更忠实，提高了描述质量和多义性捕捉能力。

Conclusion: PRISM通过捕捉特征的复杂性，显著提升了神经网络特征描述的质量和表达能力。

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior. Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的方法LoX，通过外推对齐LLM的安全子空间，显著提升了模型对微调攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对齐模型在安全性上有所改进，但微调仍可能破坏其安全保护，因此需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 提出Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX)，通过外推安全子空间增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示LoX显著降低了攻击成功率（ASR），在面对良性或恶意微调攻击时分别减少11%至54%。

Conclusion: LoX通过将参数移动到更平坦的区域，减少了对扰动的敏感性，有效提升了模型安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoRule是一种自动化方法，从人类偏好反馈中提取规则并转化为规则奖励，显著提升强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于规则的奖励方法依赖人工设计规则，AutoRule旨在自动化这一过程，提高效率和性能。

Method: AutoRule分三阶段：1) 用推理模型解释用户偏好；2) 从解释链中提取候选规则；3) 合成统一规则集，并利用语言模型验证规则满足度作为辅助奖励。

Result: 在Llama-3-8B模型上，AutoRule使AlpacaEval2.0的胜率提升28.6%，MT-Bench子集第二轮性能提升6.1%。

Conclusion: AutoRule提取的规则与数据集偏好一致，减少奖励滥用，并捕捉不同数据集的独特价值。

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\% relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a 6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset, compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at https://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoRule.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PIPE的轻量级方法，通过物理信息位置编码提升多模态时间序列预测的准确性，特别是在卫星图像数据中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注文本数据，忽略了视觉数据中的物理信息（如卫星图像的时空背景），导致预测效果受限。

Method: PIPE通过物理信息位置索引方案和变频率位置编码机制，将物理信息嵌入视觉语言模型。

Result: 在最大开源卫星图像数据集上，PIPE在深度学习和气候领域方法中均达到最优性能，台风强度预测提升12%。

Conclusion: PIPE有效解决了视觉数据中物理信息的嵌入问题，显著提升了多模态对齐和预测精度。

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data, such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

TL;DR: 稀疏自编码器（SAE）的潜在特征中，高密度特征并非训练噪声，而是具有功能性的模型表示。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高密度潜在特征的几何、功能和起源，以验证其是否为训练过程中的不良产物。

Method: 系统分析高密度潜在特征的几何结构、功能分类及其在模型各层的演化。

Result: 高密度特征形成对偶对，重建残差流中的特定方向，并具有位置追踪、上下文绑定等功能分类。

Conclusion: 高密度潜在特征是语言模型计算中的功能性组成部分，不应被视为噪声。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful. However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding, entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be dismissed as training noise.

Motivation: 尽管大模型在推理能力上取得了显著进展，但视觉语言模型在计算资源有限时仍难以进行详细视觉推理。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)训练小规模模型，结合简单奖励结构、工具调用接口优化和训练数据混合策略。

Result: 在部分视觉问答任务上，该方法优于类似规模的基线模型，得益于外部工具提供的详细视觉信息。

Conclusion: 通过GRPO和工具调用的结合，小规模模型在有限计算资源下也能实现更好的视觉推理性能。

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability, vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning, especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface, allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual information gathered from the external tool.

Method: 开发了CACTUS工具，结合遗传、饮食、临床和人口统计学因素，提升分类性能并提供可解释性。

Result: CACTUS在AMD分期分类中表现优于标准ML模型，能识别关键因素并提供结果可信度。

Conclusion: CACTUS通过消除不相关或有偏数据，为临床决策提供支持，并与现有医学知识对比验证。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use. In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports. There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary, clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5 ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust, interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

Motivation: 提出一种统一的离散语音表示方法，以桥接声学细节和词汇意义，支持下游语音生成和理解任务。

Method: 利用HuBERT和LaBSE的知识蒸馏目标，分别学习音素和词汇层次的结构，构建分层瓶颈。

Result: HAC的分解瓶颈能分离音素和词汇信息，在自然度和重建质量上优于单层基线。

Conclusion: HAC作为一种统一的离散语音表示，具有潜力支持语音生成和理解任务。

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues. Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045. Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over 3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms, including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU. ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable, cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI (T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2, while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53; Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge) and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on 749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting) and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication. FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest (adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex, race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using relatively small clinical datasets.

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets, including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders (NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

Result: DenseNet-121在内部数据集上F1-score和准确率分别为0.966和0.972，在外部数据集上表现也较好。

Conclusion: DenseNet-121在多参数MRI序列分类任务中表现优异，适用于不同来源的数据集。

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121 model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than 0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and 0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of classifying 8 body MRI series types.

Result: 在胸部X光数据集上测试，压缩因子为8时性能与计算成本最优，HE推理虽慢但实用性强。

Conclusion: 该方法在保护隐私的同时，为医疗图像的HE推理提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive, particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference, our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges, including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is available at FedWSIDD.

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently, single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However, the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel, requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness. In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types: fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise. Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test dataset.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant health problem, especially in developing countries. Early detection is critical for effective treatment. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promise in automated cervical cancer screening, but their performance depends on Pap smear image quality. This study investigates the impact of various image preprocessing techniques on CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset. Three preprocessing techniques were evaluated: perona-malik diffusion (PMD) filter for noise reduction, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement, and the proposed hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE approach. The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained models, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2, EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201. The results show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision, 13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE technique offers a new perspective in improving cervical cancer classification performance using CNN architectures.

Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets, which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights, training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical deployment.

Result: 实验显示现有AI系统与人类能力存在显著差距，凸显了跨领域智能的挑战与机遇。

Conclusion: Embodied Web Agents为AI代理的跨领域智能提供了新方向，相关资源已公开。

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and web-scale knowledge access.

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio, captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

Conclusion: pycnet-audio为声学数据处理提供了高效的工作流，适用于大规模野生动物监测项目。

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging approach in wildlife research that leverages recent improvements in purpose-made automated recording units (ARUs). The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings, e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species, anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio (Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins 2022; Ruff et al. 2020). PNW-Cnet has been expanded to detect vocalizations of ca. 80 forest wildlife species and numerous forms of anthropogenic and environmental noise (Ruff et al. 2021, 2023).

Conclusion: 持久同调提供了一种数学严谨的方法，可实时检测公共话语中的语义变化，无需事先了解具体事件。

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse? This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during crises, protests, and information shocks.

We represent the problem using a geometric formulation and propose a multi DNN based framework for obstacle avoidance of the UAV as well as the VIP. Our evaluations conducted on a drone human system in a university campus environment verifies the feasibility of our algorithms in three scenarios; when the VIP walks on a footpath, near parked vehicles, and in a crowded street.

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中，RIP显著优于现有方法，任务成功率至少提高26%。

Conclusion: RIP算法有效解决了LLM在模仿学习中的幻觉问题，提升了任务可靠性。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to enable robots to perform tasks autonomously by observing a few human demonstrations. Recently, a variant of IL, called In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\%$ improvement in task success rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

Conclusion: MCOO-SLAM通过多相机配置和语义增强，显著提升了复杂户外场景中的物体级SLAM性能。

Abstract: Object-level SLAM offers structured and semantically meaningful environment representations, making it more interpretable and suitable for high-level robotic tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent, and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes, while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators, particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks.

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking. Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments. Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes, expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at: https://github.com/HanWu3125/OS-Sketch

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3为3D生成模型提供了一种高效且样本利用率高的对齐方法。

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in 3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards. Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking, Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting within a few finetuning steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会科学研究中的广泛应用，评估其模拟人类行为的准确性变得至关重要。

Method: 使用假设检验构建定量框架，评估LLM在多选调查中模拟人类行为的能力。

Result: 研究发现，某些LLM在模拟特定人群（如不同种族、年龄和收入）时表现不佳，尤其是在争议性问题中。

Conclusion: LLM与目标人群的对齐性存在问题，需改进其在社会科学研究中的应用方式。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing, we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings. This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes) for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of human subjects.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（如GPT-4o）在提取经济叙事方面的潜力，发现其虽能生成结构化叙事，但复杂文档处理仍不及专家水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来经济叙事研究增多，但现有自然语言处理技术缺乏深层语义理解，无法区分经济叙事提取与传统任务（如语义角色标注）。

Method: 通过分析《华尔街日报》和《纽约时报》关于通胀的文章，比较GPT-4o输出与专家标注的黄金标准叙事。

Result: GPT-4o能提取结构化经济叙事，但在复杂文档和叙事处理上不及专家水平。

Conclusion: 论文为经济学和社会科学中应用大型语言模型的研究提供了未来方向。

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts. Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling. Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs to pursue similar objectives.
