We\ncompare a rule-based algorithm (RBA), RadBERT, and three lightweight\nopen-weight LLMs for multi-disease labeling of chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CAP)\nCT reports.\n  Materials and Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 40,833 CT reports\nfrom 29,540 patients, with 1,789 CAP reports manually annotated across three\norgan systems. External validation was conducted using the CT-RATE dataset.\nThree open-weight LLMs were tested with zero-shot prompting. Performance was\nevaluated using Cohen's Kappa and micro/macro-averaged F1 scores.\n  Results: In 12,197 Duke CAP reports from 8,854 patients, Llama-3.1 8B and\nGemma-3 27B showed the highest agreement ($\\kappa$ median: 0.87). On the\nmanually annotated set, Gemma-3 27B achieved the top macro-F1 (0.82), followed\nby Llama-3.1 8B (0.79), while the RBA scored lowest (0.64). On the CT-RATE\ndataset (lungs/pleura only), Llama-3.1 8B performed best (0.91), with Gemma-3\n27B close behind (0.89). Performance differences were mainly due to differing\nlabeling practices, especially for lung atelectasis.\n  Conclusion: Lightweight LLMs outperform rule-based methods for CT report\nannotation and generalize across organ systems with zero-shot prompting.\nHowever, binary labels alone cannot capture the full nuance of report language.\nLLMs can provide a flexible, efficient solution aligned with clinical judgment\nand user needs."}

Using five public datasets (1,471 stories, 101 annotators\nincluding critics, students, and lay readers), we (i) extract 17 reference-less\ntextual features (e.g., coherence, emotional variance, average sentence\nlength...); (ii) model individual reader preferences, deriving feature\nimportance vectors that reflect their textual priorities; and (iii) analyze\nthese vectors in a shared \"preference space\".

KG-BiLM\nincorporates three key components: (i) Bidirectional Knowledge Attention, which\nremoves the causal mask to enable full interaction among all tokens and\nentities; (ii) Knowledge-Masked Prediction, which encourages the model to\nleverage both local semantic contexts and global graph connectivity; and (iii)\nContrastive Graph Semantic Aggregation, which preserves KG structure via\ncontrastive alignment of sampled sub-graph representations. Extensive\nexperiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that KG-BiLM outperforms strong\nbaselines in link prediction, especially on large-scale graphs with complex\nmulti-hop relations - validating its effectiveness in unifying structural\ninformation and textual semantics."}

A common observation is that DiT latent noise vectors change slowly\nacross inference steps, which suggests that the DiT compute may be redundant\nacross steps. In this paper, we aim to speed up inference by reducing this\nredundancy, without additional training. We first study how activations change\nbetween steps in two state-of-the-art open-source DiTs. We find that just 5-25%\nof the values in attention and MLP explain 70-90% of the change in activations\nacross steps. This finding motivates our approach, Chipmunk, which uses dynamic\nsparsity at inference time to recompute only the fastest-changing intermediate\nactivations, while caching the rest. Dynamic sparsity introduces two systems\nchallenges: (1) sparse attention and MLP operations tend to underutilize GPU\ntensor cores; and (2) computing dynamic sparsity patterns at runtime and\ncaching activations both introduce overhead. To address these challenges,\nChipmunk first uses a voxel-based reordering of input tokens to introduce\ncolumn-wise sparsity. We implement column-sparse kernels utilizing efficient\nsparse gathers from global to shared GPU memory, achieving a 9.3x speedup at\n93% sparsity compared to highly-optimized dense baselines. Second, Chipmunk\noverlaps the computation of sparsity patterns and cache updates with other\nparts of the computation (e.g., second layer of the MLP) to hide the extra\nlatency. Chipmunk achieves up to 2.16x speedup on HunyuanVideo and 1.41x on\nFLUX.1-dev without compromising generation quality.

However, achieving comprehensive\ntrustworthiness in medical QA poses significant challenges due to the inherent\ncomplexity of healthcare data, the critical nature of clinical scenarios, and\nthe multifaceted dimensions of trustworthy AI. In this survey, we\nsystematically examine six key dimensions of trustworthiness in medical QA,\ni.e., Factuality, Robustness, Fairness, Safety, Explainability, and\nCalibration. We review how each dimension is evaluated in existing LLM-based\nmedical QA systems. We compile and compare major benchmarks designed to assess\nthese dimensions and analyze evaluation-guided techniques that drive model\nimprovements, such as retrieval-augmented grounding, adversarial fine-tuning,\nand safety alignment.

Second, existing methods require tuning all\ncomponents, adding complexity. Besides, these adapters alter VFM features,\nunderutilizing the prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a\nnew approach called ViT-Split, based on a key observation: the layers of\nseveral VFMs, like DINOv2, can be divided into two distinct components: an\nextractor for learning low-level features and an adapter for learning\ntask-specific features. Leveraging this insight, we eliminate the CNN branch\nand introduce two heads, task head and prior head, to the frozen VFM. The task\nhead is designed to learn task-specific features, mitigating the early gradient\npropagation issue. The prior head is used to leverage the multi-scale prior\nfeatures from the frozen VFM, reducing tuning parameters and overfitting.\nExtensive experiments on various tasks (e.g., segmentation, detection, depth\nestimation, and visual question answering) validate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of ViT-Split. Specifically, ViT-Split reduces training time up to\n$4\\times$ while achieving comparable or even better results on ADE20K, compared\nto other VFM adapters."}

To obtain training\ndata, annotators are asked to provide preferences between two videos generated\nfrom independent noise. However, this approach prohibits fine-grained\ncomparisons, and we point out that it biases the annotators towards low-motion\nclips as they often contain fewer visual artifacts. In this work, we introduce\nDenseDPO, a method that addresses these shortcomings by making three\ncontributions. First, we create each video pair for DPO by denoising corrupted\ncopies of a ground truth video. This results in aligned pairs with similar\nmotion structures while differing in local details, effectively neutralizing\nthe motion bias. Second, we leverage the resulting temporal alignment to label\npreferences on short segments rather than entire clips, yielding a denser and\nmore precise learning signal. With only one-third of the labeled data, DenseDPO\ngreatly improves motion generation over vanilla DPO, while matching it in text\nalignment, visual quality, and temporal consistency. Finally, we show that\nDenseDPO unlocks automatic preference annotation using off-the-shelf Vision\nLanguage Models (VLMs): GPT accurately predicts segment-level preferences\nsimilar to task-specifically fine-tuned video reward models, and DenseDPO\ntrained on these labels achieves performance close to using human labels."}

However, contemporary methods still face challenges in bridging the\nsemantic gap between input text prompts with sparse semantics and the target\nimages, often over-relying on low-level control signals to infer regional\ndetails. To address this challenge, we propose ControlThinker, a novel\nframework that employs a \"comprehend-then-generate\" paradigm. Firstly, by\nincentivizing the visual reasoning capability of a MLLM, latent semantics from\ncontrol images are mined to enrich text prompts. This enriched semantic\nunderstanding then seamlessly aids in image generation without the need for\nadditional complex modifications. To further tackle the uncertainty arising\nfrom the ambiguity of control images, we encourage broader exploration of\nreasoning trajectories and select the optimal one using a metric-based output\nreward model (ORM). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that\nControlThinker effectively mitigates the semantic gap between raw text prompts\nand target images, resulting in improved visual quality and semantic\nconsistency across a wide range of benchmarks.

Finally, we show that including demographic\nidentity terms (e.g., ``a woman'', ``a Black person'') in input scenarios\namplifies directional drift, despite identical underlying quantities,\nhighlighting the interplay between semantic framing and social referents. These\nfindings expose critical blind spots in standard evaluation and motivate\nframing-aware benchmarks for diagnosing reasoning robustness and fairness in\nLLMs."}

PRJ follows a\nthree-stage design: it first transforms an image into descriptive language\n(perception), then retrieves external knowledge related to harm categories and\ntraits (retrieval), and finally evaluates toxicity based on legal or normative\nrules (judgement). This language-centric structure enables the system to detect\nboth explicit and implicit harms with improved interpretability and categorical\ngranularity. In addition, we introduce a dynamic scoring mechanism based on a\ncontextual toxicity risk matrix to quantify harmfulness across different\nsemantic dimensions. Experiments show that PRJ surpasses existing safety\ncheckers in detection accuracy and robustness while uniquely supporting\nstructured category-level toxicity interpretation."}

To achieve a comprehensive\nrepresentation of interactions, we design a hierarchical interaction feature\nrepresentation so that high-level features capture the overall context of the\ninteractions, while low-level features focus on fine-grained details.

However, what is often overlooked is a\n\"precomputation step\", which requires a one-time but significant computational\ncost. The authors of MEMIT originally precompute approximately 44 million\nhidden vectors per edited layer, which requires a forward pass over 44 million\ntokens. For GPT-J (6B), this precomputation step takes 36 hours on a single\nGPU, while it takes approximately 40 hours for Llama2-7B. Additionally, this\nprecomputation time grows with model size. In this paper, we show that this\nexcessive computational cost is unnecessary. Knowledge editing using MEMIT and\nrelated methods, such as ROME and EMMET, can be performed by pre-computing a\nvery small portion of the 44 million hidden vectors. We first present the\ntheoretical minimum number of hidden vector precomputation required for\nsolutions of these editing methods to exist.

To address these challenges, task\nvector-based approaches compress task information into a single vector.\nHowever, these methods typically construct task vectors from fixed sets of\ndemonstrations and reuse them across input queries, without conditioning on the\nspecific input.

Despite\ntheir effectiveness, these methods face quadratic computation overhead as task\ncomplexity increases, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we study\nthe efficiency bottleneck neglected in original in-context conditioning video\ngeneration framework. We begin with systematic analysis to identify two key\nsources of the computation inefficiencies: the inherent redundancy within\ncontext condition tokens and the computational redundancy in context-latent\ninteractions throughout the diffusion process.

In this paper, we\nintroduce UNified In-Context Video Editing (UNIC), a simple yet effective\nframework that unifies diverse video editing tasks within a single model in an\nin-context manner. To achieve this unification, we represent the inputs of\nvarious video editing tasks as three types of tokens: the source video tokens,\nthe noisy video latent, and the multi-modal conditioning tokens that vary\naccording to the specific editing task. Based on this formulation, our key\ninsight is to integrate these three types into a single consecutive token\nsequence and jointly model them using the native attention operations of DiT,\nthereby eliminating the need for task-specific adapter designs. Nevertheless,\ndirect task unification under this framework is challenging, leading to severe\ntoken collisions and task confusion due to the varying video lengths and\ndiverse condition modalities across tasks. To address these, we introduce\ntask-aware RoPE to facilitate consistent temporal positional encoding, and\ncondition bias that enables the model to clearly differentiate different\nediting tasks. This allows our approach to adaptively perform different video\nediting tasks by referring the source video and varying condition tokens \"in\ncontext\", and support flexible task composition.

To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study\nacross models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial\nperformance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to\n\"overthinking\".
