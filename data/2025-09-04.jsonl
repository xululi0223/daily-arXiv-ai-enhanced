Recent\ntrends show that the required energy for these datacenters will rise over time,\nor at least remain constant. Hence, the scientific community developed\ndifferent algorithms, architectures, and approaches for improving the energy\nefficiency of cloud datacenters, which are summarized under the umbrella term\nGreen Cloud computing. In this paper, we use an economic approach - taxes - for\nreducing the energy consumption of datacenters. We developed a tax model called\nGreenCloud tax, which penalizes energy-inefficient datacenters while fostering\ndatacenters that are energy-efficient. Hence, providers running\nenergy-efficient datacenters are able to offer cheaper prices to consumers,\nwhich consequently leads to a shift of workloads from energy-inefficient\ndatacenters to energy-efficient datacenters. The GreenCloud tax approach was\nimplemented using the simulation environment CloudSim. We applied real data\nsets published in the SPEC benchmark for the executed simulation scenarios,\nwhich we used for evaluating the GreenCloud tax."}

Experiment results show that our proposed\nmethod achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7\nfor RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58%\nrespectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under\ndifferent missing types and rates.

Numerous visual-only approaches\naddress these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,\nyet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex\nocclusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic\ncues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground\ninformation, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by\nhuman perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the\nforeground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background\ndistractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper\nproposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background\ninformation within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To\nhelp the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an\nintra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.\nSpecifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same\nsemantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between\nforeground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative\npower. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background\nregions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.\nComprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with\nresults that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches."}

Pre-training broke the symmetry among\ntokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as\ninferred from the presented token confusion matrix.

Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible\ndeformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent\nwith previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object\ninteraction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based\nDiffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand\nsurface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned\nissues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of\ninterpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand\ndeformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual\ndescriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling\nmore semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and\nquantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour method."}

Despite widespread global deployment,\ncurrent evaluations remain predominantly US-English-centric, leaving potential\nharms in other linguistic and cultural contexts largely underexamined. We\nintroduce a novel, culturally-grounded framework for detecting social biases in\ninstruction-tuned LLMs. Our approach adapts the underspecified question\nmethodology from the BBQ dataset by incorporating culturally-specific\nexpressions and sayings that encode regional stereotypes across four social\ncategories: gender, race, socioeconomic class, and national origin. Using more\nthan 4,000 prompts, we propose a new metric that combines accuracy with the\ndirection of error to effectively balance model performance and bias alignment\nin both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts. To our knowledge, our work\npresents the first systematic evaluation examining how leading commercial LLMs\nrespond to culturally specific bias in the Spanish language, revealing varying\npatterns of bias manifestation across state-of-the-art models. We also\ncontribute evidence that bias mitigation techniques optimized for English do\nnot effectively transfer to Spanish tasks, and that bias patterns remain\nlargely consistent across different sampling temperatures.

We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion\nModel (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes.

However, the emergence of\nincreasingly powerful and multifold larger generalist foundation models such as\nDINOv2 and DINOv3 raises the question of whether domain-specific pre-training\nremains essential, and if so, what gap persists. To investigate this, we\nsystematically evaluated the adaptability of DINOv2 and DINOv3 in retinal image\napplications, compared to two specialist RETFound models, RETFound-MAE and\nRETFound-DINOv2. We assessed performance on ocular disease detection and\nsystemic disease prediction using two adaptation strategies: fine-tuning and\nlinear probing. Data efficiency and adaptation efficiency were further analysed\nto characterise trade-offs between predictive performance and computational\ncost. Our results show that although scaling generalist models yields strong\nadaptability across diverse tasks, RETFound-DINOv2 consistently outperforms\nthese generalist foundation models in ocular-disease detection and oculomics\ntasks, demonstrating stronger generalisability and data efficiency. These\nfindings suggest that specialist retinal foundation models remain the most\neffective choice for clinical applications, while the narrowing gap with\ngeneralist foundation models suggests that continued data and model scaling can\ndeliver domain-relevant gains and position them as strong foundations for\nfuture medical foundation models."}

In this work, we\ndescribe how an off-the-shelf smartphone and smartwatch can work together to\naccurately estimate arm pose. Moving beyond prior work, we take advantage of\nmore recent ultra-wideband (UWB) functionality on these devices to capture\nabsolute distance between the two devices. This measurement is the perfect\ncomplement to inertial data, which is relative and suffers from drift. We\nquantify the performance of our software-only approach using off-the-shelf\ndevices, showing it can estimate the wrist and elbow joints with a \\hl{median\npositional error of 11.0~cm}, without the user having to provide training data."}

The\nsystem is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by\nfinetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model\ninstead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts\ndiscrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the\nparameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including\nlateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and\nlongitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,\ncontinuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently\ninterpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in\noutput size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a\nstate-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating\nperformance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant\nadvantages in explainability and resource efficiency."}

We propose Robult, a scalable framework\ndesigned to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific\ninformation and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic\napproach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled\n(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while\neffectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)\na latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information\nis retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance\nperformance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete\nmodalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets\nvalidate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in\nboth semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its\nlightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing\narchitectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications."}
