To address this issue, we propose a \\textbf{class-aware prompt\ngenerator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts.

However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry\nmodeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture\nsynthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end\nPBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter\n(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR\nmaterials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel\nperspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.\nSpecifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV\ndiffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,\nenabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple\ndiffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns\nmultiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed\nvariational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D\nGaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated\npost-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh\nassets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative\nexperiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and\nimage-conditioned MV diffusion models.

Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and\n25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high\n(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address\nthis issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage\nin order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D\nintracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age\nand the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and\nmultimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection\n(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a\nsubsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse\npatients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:\n0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal\nXSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to\nmodality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the\nmultimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,\ndeeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both\nheart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of\nrelapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we\nstrive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining."}

At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy\npre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar\ndistractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features\nwithout explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To\naddress these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general\nframework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point\nclouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or\n3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative\nRepresentation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target\nsemantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.\nThis mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances\nresilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within\nLLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation\nDecoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying\nLLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving\ncomprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline.

Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy\ndiversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with\nsynthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D\ngeneration to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging\nbenchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further\ndemonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the\npracticality of our method in real-world manipulation.
