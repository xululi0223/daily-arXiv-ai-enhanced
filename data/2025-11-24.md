### [1] [Shona spaCy: A Morphological Analyzer for an Under-Resourced Bantu Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16680)
*Happymore Masoka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于spaCy框架的绍纳语形态分析工具包Shona spaCy，包含词典和规则系统，支持词性标注和形态特征分析，准确率分别达到90%和88%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 绍纳语作为班图语系语言，在自然语言处理领域资源匮乏，缺乏形态分析和语言感知工具，需要开发专门的分析工具来提升数字包容性。

Method: 基于spaCy框架构建规则驱动的形态分析管道，结合精心策划的JSON词典和语言学规则，建模名词类前缀、动词主语一致、时体标记、拟声词和附着词等。

Result: 在正式和非正式绍纳语语料库上评估，词性标注准确率达到90%，形态特征分析准确率达到88%，工具包已通过pip发布。

Conclusion: Shona spaCy填补了绍纳语NLP工具的空白，为其他资源匮乏的班图语言提供了形态分析工具的模板，促进了数字包容性。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in multilingual natural language processing (NLP), the Bantu language Shona remains under-served in terms of morphological analysis and language-aware tools. This paper presents Shona spaCy, an open-source, rule-based morphological pipeline for Shona built on the spaCy framework. The system combines a curated JSON lexicon with linguistically grounded rules to model noun-class prefixes (Mupanda 1-18), verbal subject concords, tense-aspect markers, ideophones, and clitics, integrating these into token-level annotations for lemma, part-of-speech, and morphological features. The toolkit is available via pip install shona-spacy, with source code at https://github.com/HappymoreMasoka/shona-spacy and a PyPI release at https://pypi.org/project/shona-spacy/0.1.4/. Evaluation on formal and informal Shona corpora yields 90% POS-tagging accuracy and 88% morphological-feature accuracy, while maintaining transparency in its linguistic decisions. By bridging descriptive grammar and computational implementation, Shona spaCy advances NLP accessibility and digital inclusion for Shona speakers and provides a template for morphological analysis tools for other under-resourced Bantu languages.

### [2] [Towards Hyper-Efficient RAG Systems in VecDBs: Distributed Parallel Multi-Resolution Vector Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16681)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPI是一种多分辨率向量索引框架，通过语义金字塔和查询自适应分辨率控制，在保持语义覆盖的同时显著加速检索速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量数据库检索管道使用扁平或单分辨率索引结构，无法适应不同用户查询所需的语义粒度变化，导致检索速度和上下文相关性之间的次优权衡。

Method: SPI在文档嵌入上构建语义金字塔，通过轻量级分类器为每个查询动态选择最优分辨率级别，实现从粗到细的渐进式检索。

Result: SPI在FAISS和Qdrant后端上实现，在多个RAG任务中实现高达5.7倍的检索加速和1.8倍的内存效率提升，同时端到端QA F1分数提升高达2.5分。

Conclusion: SPI框架与现有向量数据库基础设施兼容，可立即在生产RAG系统中部署，提供检索质量和延迟保证。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become a dominant approach to augment large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, existing vector database (VecDB) retrieval pipelines rely on flat or single-resolution indexing structures, which cannot adapt to the varying semantic granularity required by diverse user queries. This limitation leads to suboptimal trade-offs between retrieval speed and contextual relevance.
  To address this, we propose \textbf{Semantic Pyramid Indexing (SPI)}, a novel multi-resolution vector indexing framework that introduces query-adaptive resolution control for RAG in VecDBs. Unlike existing hierarchical methods that require offline tuning or separate model training, SPI constructs a semantic pyramid over document embeddings and dynamically selects the optimal resolution level per query through a lightweight classifier. This adaptive approach enables progressive retrieval from coarse-to-fine representations, significantly accelerating search while maintaining semantic coverage.
  We implement SPI as a plugin for both FAISS and Qdrant backends and evaluate it across multiple RAG tasks including MS MARCO, Natural Questions, and multimodal retrieval benchmarks. SPI achieves up to \textbf{5.7$\times$} retrieval speedup and \textbf{1.8$\times$} memory efficiency gain while improving end-to-end QA F1 scores by up to \textbf{2.5 points} compared to strong baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides guarantees on retrieval quality and latency bounds, while extensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. The framework's compatibility with existing VecDB infrastructures makes it readily deployable in production RAG systems. Code is availabe at \href{https://github.com/FastLM/SPI_VecDB}{https://github.com/FastLM/SPI\_VecDB}.

### [3] [Bench360: Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360°](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16682)
*Linus Stuhlmann,Mauricio Fadel Argerich,Jonathan Fürst*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bench360是一个用于本地LLM推理的综合性基准测试框架，支持用户自定义任务、数据集和指标，自动测试不同模型、推理引擎和量化级别，揭示任务性能与系统效率之间的权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试工具设计目标狭窄，无法整合系统指标和任务特定指标，缺乏统一的易用框架来支持多种推理引擎、使用场景和量化级别。

Method: 开发Bench360框架，允许用户定义自定义任务、数据集和任务特定指标，自动测试选择的LLM、推理引擎和量化级别，涵盖单流、批处理和服务器等使用场景，跟踪计算性能、资源使用、部署等系统指标以及ROUGE、F1分数等任务特定指标。

Result: 在四个常见LLM任务、三个硬件平台和四个推理引擎上的测试结果显示，任务性能与系统级效率之间存在有趣的权衡关系，不同推理引擎和模型表现差异明显。

Conclusion: 本地推理没有单一最佳设置，这强烈需要像Bench360这样的框架来帮助用户做出明智的配置选择。

Abstract: Running large language models (LLMs) locally is becoming increasingly common. While the growing availability of small open-source models and inference engines has lowered the entry barrier, users now face an overwhelming number of configuration choices. Identifying an optimal configuration -- balancing functional and non-functional requirements -- requires substantial manual effort. While several benchmarks target LLM inference, they are designed for narrow evaluation goals and not user-focused. They fail to integrate relevant system and task-specific metrics into a unified, easy-to-use benchmark that supports multiple inference engines, usage scenarios, and quantization levels. To address this gap, we present Bench360 -- Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360°. Bench360 allows users to easily define their own custom tasks along with datasets and relevant task-specific metrics and then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch & server). Bench360 tracks a wide range of metrics, including (1) system metrics -- such as Computing Performance (e.g., latency, throughput), Resource Usage (e.g., energy per query), and Deployment (e.g., cold start time) -- and (2) task-specific metrics such as ROUGE, F1 score or accuracy. We demonstrate Bench360 on four common LLM tasks -- General Knowledge & Reasoning, QA, Summarization and Text-to-SQL -- across three hardware platforms and four state of the art inference engines. Our results reveal several interesting trade-offs between task performance and system-level efficiency, highlighting the differences in inference engines and models. Most importantly, there is no single best setup for local inference, which strongly motivates the need for a framework such as Bench360.

### [4] [How Well Do LLMs Understand Tunisian Arabic?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16683)
*Mohamed Mahdi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了工业级大语言模型对突尼斯阿拉伯语等低资源语言的理解能力，创建了包含突尼斯方言、标准阿拉伯语和英语的平行数据集，并在转写、翻译和情感分析三个任务上评估了多个流行LLM的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业级LLM往往忽视低资源语言（如突尼斯阿拉伯语）的理解能力，这可能导致数百万突尼斯人无法用自己的语言与AI充分交互，被迫使用法语或英语，威胁突尼斯方言的保存并影响年轻一代的语言偏好。

Method: 创建包含突尼斯方言、标准阿拉伯语和英语的平行翻译数据集及情感标签，在转写、翻译和情感分析三个任务上对多个流行LLM进行基准测试。

Result: 结果显示不同模型之间存在显著差异，突显了它们在理解和处理突尼斯方言方面的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: 通过量化这些差距，本研究强调了在下一代AI系统中包含低资源语言的重要性，以确保技术保持可访问性、包容性和文化基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are the engines driving today's AI agents. The better these models understand human languages, the more natural and user-friendly the interaction with AI becomes, from everyday devices like computers and smartwatches to any tool that can act intelligently. Yet, the ability of industrial-scale LLMs to comprehend low-resource languages, such as Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi), is often overlooked. This neglect risks excluding millions of Tunisians from fully interacting with AI in their own language, pushing them toward French or English. Such a shift not only threatens the preservation of the Tunisian dialect but may also create challenges for literacy and influence younger generations to favor foreign languages. In this study, we introduce a novel dataset containing parallel Tunizi, standard Tunisian Arabic, and English translations, along with sentiment labels. We benchmark several popular LLMs on three tasks: transliteration, translation, and sentiment analysis. Our results reveal significant differences between models, highlighting both their strengths and limitations in understanding and processing Tunisian dialects. By quantifying these gaps, this work underscores the importance of including low-resource languages in the next generation of AI systems, ensuring technology remains accessible, inclusive, and culturally grounded.

### [5] [Training Foundation Models on a Full-Stack AMD Platform: Compute, Networking, and System Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17127)
*Quentin Anthony,Yury Tokpanov,Skyler Szot,Srivatsan Rajagopal,Praneeth Medepalli,Rishi Iyer,Vasu Shyam,Anna Golubeva,Ansh Chaurasia,Xiao Yang,Tomas Figliolia,Robert Washbourne,Drew Thorstensen,Amartey Pearson,Zack Grossbart,Jason van Patten,Emad Barsoum,Zhenyu Gu,Yao Fu,Beren Millidge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首个在纯AMD硬件上大规模MoE预训练研究，使用MI300X GPU和Pollara互连，提供系统设计和模型设计的实用指导，并展示了ZAYA1-base模型的竞争性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证AMD硬件、网络和软件栈在大规模预训练中的成熟度和竞争力，为使用AMD硬件进行MoE模型训练提供系统级和模型级的实用指导。

Method: 进行全面的集群和网络特性分析，包括核心集合操作的微基准测试；开发MI300X感知的transformer尺寸规则；设计优化训练吞吐量和推理延迟的MoE宽度；构建完整的训练栈，包括容错和检查点重塑等实用工具。

Result: ZAYA1-base模型（760M激活参数，8.3B总参数）在推理、数学和编程基准测试中表现优异，性能与Qwen3-4B和Gemma3-12B相当，并优于Llama-3-8B和OLMoE等模型。

Conclusion: AMD硬件、网络和软件栈已经足够成熟和优化，能够支持具有竞争力的大规模预训练，为AMD生态系统的发展提供了有力证据。

Abstract: We report on the first large-scale mixture-of-experts (MoE) pretraining study on pure AMD hardware, utilizing both MI300X GPUs with Pollara interconnect. We distill practical guidance for both systems and model design. On the systems side, we deliver a comprehensive cluster and networking characterization: microbenchmarks for all core collectives (all-reduce, reduce-scatter, all-gather, broadcast) across message sizes and GPU counts on Pollara. To our knowledge, this is the first at this scale. We further provide MI300X microbenchmarks on kernel sizing and memory bandwidth to inform model design. On the modeling side, we introduce and apply MI300X-aware transformer sizing rules for attention and MLP blocks and justify MoE widths that jointly optimize training throughput and inference latency. We describe our training stack in depth, including often-ignored utilities such as fault-tolerance and checkpoint-reshaping, as well as detailed information on our training recipe. We also provide a preview of our model architecture and base model - ZAYA1 (760M active, 8.3B total parameters MoE) - which will be further improved upon in forthcoming papers. ZAYA1-base achieves performance comparable to leading base models such as Qwen3-4B and Gemma3-12B at its scale and larger, and outperforms models including Llama-3-8B and OLMoE across reasoning, mathematics, and coding benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that the AMD hardware, network, and software stack are mature and optimized enough for competitive large-scale pretraining.

### [6] [Ellipsoid-Based Decision Boundaries for Open Intent Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16685)
*Yuetian Zou,Hanlei Zhang,Hua Xu,Songze Li,Long Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出EliDecide方法，通过椭圆体决策边界解决文本开放意图分类问题，相比传统球形边界能更好地处理不同特征方向的分布差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自适应决策边界方法假设已知类呈各向同性分布，仅使用球形边界，忽略了不同特征方向的分布差异，限制了开放意图检测的性能。

Method: 1) 使用监督对比学习获得判别性特征空间；2) 用可学习矩阵参数化椭圆体作为已知类边界；3) 通过双损失函数优化边界，平衡经验风险和开放空间风险。

Result: 在多个文本意图基准和问答分类数据集上达到最先进性能，椭圆体边界展现出优越的开放意图检测能力和泛化潜力。

Conclusion: EliDecide通过灵活的椭圆体决策边界有效解决了开放意图分类问题，在复杂开放世界场景中具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Textual open intent classification is crucial for real-world dialogue systems, enabling robust detection of unknown user intents without prior knowledge and contributing to the robustness of the system. While adaptive decision boundary methods have shown great potential by eliminating manual threshold tuning, existing approaches assume isotropic distributions of known classes, restricting boundaries to balls and overlooking distributional variance along different directions. To address this limitation, we propose EliDecide, a novel method that learns ellipsoid decision boundaries with varying scales along different feature directions. First, we employ supervised contrastive learning to obtain a discriminative feature space for known samples. Second, we apply learnable matrices to parameterize ellipsoids as the boundaries of each known class, offering greater flexibility than spherical boundaries defined solely by centers and radii. Third, we optimize the boundaries via a novelly designed dual loss function that balances empirical and open-space risks: expanding boundaries to cover known samples while contracting them against synthesized pseudo-open samples. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text intent benchmarks and further on a question classification dataset. The flexibility of the ellipsoids demonstrates superior open intent detection capability and strong potential for generalization to more text classification tasks in diverse complex open-world scenarios.

### [7] [Prompt-Based Value Steering of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16688)
*Giulio Antonio Abbo,Tony Belpaeme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种评估提示词能否有效引导生成文本朝向特定人类价值观的实用方法，无需模型微调即可实现价值观引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型微调方法在应对动态价值观和偏好时存在局限性，需要一种能够评估和引导模型响应符合特定人类价值观的方法。

Method: 开发了一种模型无关的评估程序，通过量化生成响应中目标价值观的存在和增益来评分，基于Schwartz基本人类价值观理论，使用对话数据集进行结构化评估。

Result: 在Wizard-Vicuna语言模型上验证，显示即使不改变模型或动态优化提示，价值观引导也是可行的。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用、可复现的方式来评估和实现价值观引导，为模型安全对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in applications where alignment with human values is critical. While model fine-tuning is often employed to ensure safe responses, this technique is static and does not lend itself to everyday situations involving dynamic values and preferences. In this paper, we present a practical, reproducible, and model-agnostic procedure to evaluate whether a prompt candidate can effectively steer generated text toward specific human values, formalising a scoring method to quantify the presence and gain of target values in generated responses. We apply our method to a variant of the Wizard-Vicuna language model, using Schwartz's theory of basic human values and a structured evaluation through a dialogue dataset. With this setup, we compare a baseline prompt to one explicitly conditioned on values, and show that value steering is possible even without altering the model or dynamically optimising prompts.

### [8] [Concept-Based Interpretability for Toxicity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16689)
*Samarth Garg,Deeksha Varshney,Divya Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出基于概念梯度的可解释性技术，通过分析概念变化对模型输出的直接影响来改进毒性检测，并引入目标词典集和词概念对齐分数来量化误分类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前毒性检测研究主要关注文本特征，但基于概念的解释探索有限。概念（如淫秽、威胁、侮辱等）作为毒性语言的强指标，但概念对目标类的不均衡归因常导致分类错误。

Method: 1. 使用概念梯度方法提供因果解释；2. 构建目标词典集捕捉导致误分类的有毒词汇；3. 计算词概念对齐分数量化词汇对误分类的影响；4. 提出无词典增强策略生成排除预定义有毒词汇的样本。

Result: 该方法能够识别导致模型误分类的有毒词汇，并通过词概念对齐分数量化这些词汇因过度归因于毒性概念而导致的错误程度。

Conclusion: 概念梯度方法为毒性检测提供了更因果的解释，目标词典集和词概念对齐分数有助于理解模型误分类机制，无词典增强策略揭示了模型在排除显性词汇重叠后对更广泛毒性语言模式的归因行为。

Abstract: The rise of social networks has not only facilitated communication but also allowed the spread of harmful content. Although significant advances have been made in detecting toxic language in textual data, the exploration of concept-based explanations in toxicity detection remains limited. In this study, we leverage various subtype attributes present in toxicity detection datasets, such as obscene, threat, insult, identity attack, and sexual explicit as concepts that serve as strong indicators to identify whether language is toxic. However, disproportionate attribution of concepts towards the target class often results in classification errors. Our work introduces an interpretability technique based on the Concept Gradient (CG) method which provides a more causal interpretation by measuring how changes in concepts directly affect the output of the model. This is an extension of traditional gradient-based methods in machine learning, which often focus solely on input features. We propose the curation of Targeted Lexicon Set, which captures toxic words that contribute to misclassifications in text classification models. To assess the significance of these lexicon sets in misclassification, we compute Word-Concept Alignment (WCA) scores, which quantify the extent to which these words lead to errors due to over-attribution to toxic concepts. Finally, we introduce a lexicon-free augmentation strategy by generating toxic samples that exclude predefined toxic lexicon sets. This approach allows us to examine whether over-attribution persists when explicit lexical overlap is removed, providing insights into the model's attribution on broader toxic language patterns.

### [9] [Falsely Accused: How AI Detectors Misjudge Slightly Polished Arabic Articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16690)
*Saleh Almohaimeed,Saad Almohaimeed,Mousa Jari,Khaled A. Alobaid,Fahad Alotaibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 阿拉伯语AI检测模型在检测轻微AI润色的人类文章时表现不佳，会错误地将这些文章归类为AI生成，导致误判作者使用AI抄袭。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI检测模型对轻微AI润色的人类文章的误分类问题，特别是在阿拉伯语领域缺乏相关研究。

Method: 生成两个阿拉伯语数据集：一个包含800篇文章用于评估14个LLM和商业AI检测器的性能；另一个包含400篇人类文章经10个LLM用4种润色设置处理后的16400个样本，用于评估轻微润色对检测器的影响。

Result: 所有AI检测器都会错误地将大量轻微润色的人类文章归为AI生成。最佳LLM Claude-4 Sonnet准确率从83.51%降至57.63%；最佳商业模型originality.AI准确率从92%降至12%。

Conclusion: 当前阿拉伯语AI检测模型对轻微AI润色的人类文章存在严重误判问题，需要改进检测算法以应对这种边缘情况。

Abstract: Many AI detection models have been developed to counter the presence of articles created by artificial intelligence (AI). However, if a human-authored article is slightly polished by AI, a shift will occur in the borderline decision of these AI detection models, leading them to consider it AI-generated article. This misclassification may result in falsely accusing authors of AI plagiarism and harm the credibility of AI detector models. In English, some efforts were made to meet this challenge, but not in Arabic. In this paper, we generated two datasets. The first dataset contains 800 Arabic articles, half AI-generated and half human-authored. We used it to evaluate 14 Large Language models (LLMs) and commercial AI detectors to assess their ability in distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated articles. The best 8 models were chosen to act as detectors for our primary concern, which is whether they would consider slightly polished human text as AI-generated. The second dataset, Ar-APT, contains 400 Arabic human-authored articles polished by 10 LLMs using 4 polishing settings, totaling 16400 samples. We use it to evaluate the 8 nominated models and determine whether slight polishing will affect their performance. The results reveal that all AI detectors incorrectly attribute a significant number of articles to AI. The best performing LLM, Claude-4 Sonnet, achieved 83.51%, their performance decreased to 57.63% for articles slightly polished by LLaMA-3. Whereas for the best performing commercial model, originality.AI, that achieves 92% accuracy, dropped to 12% for articles slightly polished by Mistral or Gemma-3.

### [10] [Reproducibility Report: Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16691)
*Boyang Zhou,Johan Lindqvist,Lindsey Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 我们复现了基于最近邻的测试时训练方法，该方法通过在推理时使用检索到的最近邻序列进行微调，显著降低了语言模型的困惑度和比特率指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证测试时训练方法在不同规模语言模型和不同领域数据上的有效性，特别是对于未在类似数据上预训练的模型，以及探索该方法在现代推理优化架构上的适用性。

Method: 使用预训练的RoBERTa嵌入和Faiss索引检索每个测试输入的20个最近邻，对GPT-2、GPT-Neo和R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B模型应用每个邻居一次梯度更新，并采用内存高效的检索实现。

Result: 测试时训练显著降低了困惑度和比特率指标，在结构化或专业数据集（如GitHub和EuroParl）上改进最大，未在The Pile上预训练的模型受益更多，小模型可以接近大模型的性能。

Conclusion: 最近邻测试时训练方法具有鲁棒性和通用性，即使对于现代推理优化架构也能带来一致增益，同时需要关注大规模检索增强适应的实际考虑。

Abstract: We reproduce the central claims of Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models (Hardt and Sun, 2024), which proposes adapting a language model at inference time by fine-tuning on retrieved nearest-neighbor sequences. Using pretrained RoBERTa embeddings indexed with Faiss, we retrieve 20 neighbors per test input and apply one gradient update per neighbor across GPT-2 (117M, 774M), GPT-Neo (1.3B), and R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B. Our experiments confirm that test-time training significantly reduces perplexity and bits-per-byte metrics across diverse domains from The Pile, with the largest improvements in structured or specialized datasets such as GitHub and EuroParl. We further validate that models not pretrained on The Pile benefit more from this adaptation than models already trained on similar data, allowing smaller models to approach the performance of larger ones. Due to infrastructure limitations, we introduce a memory-efficient retrieval implementation that loads only required line offsets rather than entire files, reducing RAM requirements from over 128 GB per server to 32 GB. We also extend the original study by evaluating R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B, showing that test-time training yields consistent gains even for modern reasoning-optimized architectures. Overall, our results support the robustness and generality of nearest-neighbor test-time training while highlighting practical considerations for reproducing large-scale retrieval-augmented adaptation.

### [11] [How Language Directions Align with Token Geometry in Multilingual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16693)
*JaeSeong Kim,Suan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文系统分析了多语言大模型内部表示空间中语言信息的结构特征，发现语言信息在第一个Transformer块就实现高度线性可分，且语言方向与词汇嵌入的对齐程度与训练数据的语言组成密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对多语言LLM内部语言信息结构及其在不同层间如何涌现的系统性分析有限，需要深入理解语言在模型表示空间中的编码方式。

Method: 使用线性和非线性探针结合新的Token-Language Alignment分析，对6个多语言LLM的268个Transformer层进行全面探测研究。

Result: 语言信息在第一个Transformer块就实现76.4±8.2个百分点的分离度提升，中文包含模型的中文匹配峰值达到16.43%，而英语中心模型仅为3.90%，显示出4.21倍的结构印记效应。

Conclusion: 多语言LLM不是通过表面脚本特征而是通过训练语料塑造的潜在表示结构来区分语言，这为多语言表示学习的数据组成策略和公平性提供了实践启示。

Abstract: Multilingual LLMs demonstrate strong performance across diverse languages, yet there has been limited systematic analysis of how language information is structured within their internal representation space and how it emerges across layers. We conduct a comprehensive probing study on six multilingual LLMs, covering all 268 transformer layers, using linear and nonlinear probes together with a new Token--Language Alignment analysis to quantify the layer-wise dynamics and geometric structure of language encoding. Our results show that language information becomes sharply separated in the first transformer block (+76.4$\pm$8.2 percentage points from Layer 0 to 1) and remains almost fully linearly separable throughout model depth. We further find that the alignment between language directions and vocabulary embeddings is strongly tied to the language composition of the training data. Notably, Chinese-inclusive models achieve a ZH Match@Peak of 16.43\%, whereas English-centric models achieve only 3.90\%, revealing a 4.21$\times$ structural imprinting effect. These findings indicate that multilingual LLMs distinguish languages not by surface script features but by latent representational structures shaped by the training corpus. Our analysis provides practical insights for data composition strategies and fairness in multilingual representation learning.

### [12] [Hierarchical Retrieval with Out-Of-Vocabulary Queries: A Case Study on SNOMED CT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16698)
*Jonathon Dilworth,Hui Yang,Jiaoyan Chen,Yongsheng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于语言模型的SNOMED CT本体嵌入方法，用于解决词汇外查询的概念检索问题，在层次概念检索任务上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNOMED CT中的知识检索面临语言歧义、同义词和多义词等挑战，当查询是词汇外(OOV)时问题更加严重，需要有效的方法来检索层次概念。

Method: 基于语言模型的本体嵌入方法，构建OOV查询标注数据集，测试直接子类和较少相关祖先的检索性能。

Result: 该方法在SNOMED CT概念检索中优于SBERT和两种词汇匹配基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，可扩展到其他本体，并发布了代码、工具和评估数据集。

Abstract: SNOMED CT is a biomedical ontology with a hierarchical representation of large-scale concepts. Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT is critical for its application, but often proves challenging due to language ambiguity, synonyms, polysemies and so on. This problem is exacerbated when the queries are out-of-vocabulary (OOV), i.e., having no equivalent matchings in the ontology. In this work, we focus on the problem of hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT with OOV queries, and propose an approach based on language model-based ontology embeddings. For evaluation, we construct OOV queries annotated against SNOMED CT concepts, testing the retrieval of the most direct subsumers and their less relevant ancestors. We find that our method outperforms the baselines including SBERT and two lexical matching methods. While evaluated against SNOMED CT, the approach is generalisable and can be extended to other ontologies. We release code, tools, and evaluation datasets at https://github.com/jonathondilworth/HR-OOV.

*Juan P. Cadile*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现共情行为是LLM激活空间中的线性方向，所有模型都能高精度检测共情，但操控能力因模型而异。安全训练不影响共情编码，但影响操控鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM中'行动共情'（牺牲任务效率满足人类需求）的神经表征，以及不同模型在检测和操控共情行为方面的差异。

Method: 使用基于EIA基准的对比提示，在Phi-3-mini-4k、Qwen2.5-7B和Dolphin-Llama-3.1-8B三个模型上进行检测和操控实验。

Result: 检测：所有模型AUROC达0.996-1.00；操控：Qwen和Phi-3双向操控成功率达65.3%和61.7%，Dolphin仅支持增强共情（94.4%成功率），反共情操控会崩溃。

Conclusion: 检测与操控能力存在模型差异，安全训练影响操控鲁棒性而非防止操控，需要更多模型验证。

Abstract: We investigate empathy-in-action -- the willingness to sacrifice task efficiency to address human needs -- as a linear direction in LLM activation space. Using contrastive prompts grounded in the Empathy-in-Action (EIA) benchmark, we test detection and steering across Phi-3-mini-4k (3.8B), Qwen2.5-7B (safety-trained), and Dolphin-Llama-3.1-8B (uncensored).
  Detection: All models show AUROC 0.996-1.00 at optimal layers. Uncensored Dolphin matches safety-trained models, demonstrating empathy encoding emerges independent of safety training. Phi-3 probes correlate strongly with EIA behavioral scores (r=0.71, p<0.01). Cross-model probe agreement is limited (Qwen: r=-0.06, Dolphin: r=0.18), revealing architecture-specific implementations despite convergent detection.
  Steering: Qwen achieves 65.3% success with bidirectional control and coherence at extreme interventions. Phi-3 shows 61.7% success with similar coherence. Dolphin exhibits asymmetric steerability: 94.4% success for pro-empathy steering but catastrophic breakdown for anti-empathy (empty outputs, code artifacts).
  Implications: The detection-steering gap varies by model. Qwen and Phi-3 maintain bidirectional coherence; Dolphin shows robustness only for empathy enhancement. Safety training may affect steering robustness rather than preventing manipulation, though validation across more models is needed.

Motivation: 解决从孟加拉语指令生成代码的任务，通过多代理协作提高代码生成的质量和准确性。

Method: 使用多代理管道：代码生成代理首先生成初始解决方案，然后执行单元测试，仅将失败的测试用例转发给调试代理，调试代理根据错误信息、当前程序和相关测试用例生成修订解决方案。

Result: 在BLP-2025共享任务中获得第一名，Pass@1得分达到95.4%。

Conclusion: 多代理协作的代码生成方法能够有效提高代码生成质量，在代码生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper presents JGU Mainz's winning system for the BLP-2025 Shared Task on Code Generation from Bangla Instructions. We propose a multi-agent-based pipeline. First, a code-generation agent produces an initial solution from the input instruction. The candidate program is then executed against the provided unit tests (pytest-style, assert-based). Only the failing cases are forwarded to a debugger agent, which reruns the tests, extracts error traces, and, conditioning on the error messages, the current program, and the relevant test cases, generates a revised solution. Using this approach, our submission achieved first place in the shared task with a $Pass@1$ score of 95.4. We also make our code public.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于延伸心智理论和激进具身认知的非表征性翻译心智模型，强调翻译是情感、行为和认知过程动态整合的具身活动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战基于表征的心智模型，为翻译研究提供非表征性的替代框架，强调翻译是动态的具身参与过程而非静态符号操作。

Method: 结合延伸心智理论、激进具身认知、预测处理和主动推理，构建ABC（情感-行为-认知）翻译心智框架。

Result: 提出了翻译心智通过脑-体-环境互动循环涌现的观点，将翻译重新定义为在社会文化实践中技能性参与的意义共创过程。

Conclusion: 翻译不是表征操作，而是通过具身互动在实时中共同创造意义的动态活动，心智在翻译过程中涌现而非仅仅延伸。

Abstract: Building on the Extended Mind (EM) theory and radical enactivism, this article suggests an alternative to representation-based models of the mind. We lay out a novel ABC framework of the translating mind, in which translation is not the manipulation of static interlingual correspondences but an enacted activity, dynamically integrating affective, behavioral, and cognitive (ABC) processes. Drawing on Predictive Processing and (En)Active Inference, we argue that the translator's mind emerges, rather than being merely extended, through loops of brain-body-environment interactions. This non-representational account reframes translation as skillful participation in sociocultural practice, where meaning is co-created in real time through embodied interaction with texts, tools, and contexts.

*Eva Neu,Brian Dillon,Katrin Erk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究重新探讨了非宾格动词与施事性/终结性之间的关系，通过可解释维度分析支持了传统观点，并展示了结合人类判断的方法能更好地揭示语义特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管传统观点认为描述施事行为的动词更倾向于非作格句法，而描述终结事件的动词更倾向于非宾格句法，但Kim等人(2024)的研究发现人类对施事性和终结性的评分并不能很好地预测不及物动词的句法行为。

Method: 使用基于施事性和终结性两极种子词计算的可解释维度来重新分析这个问题。

Result: 研究结果支持了非作格性/非宾格性与施事性/终结性之间的联系。

Conclusion: 使用可解释维度结合人类判断可以为难以在评分任务中评估的语义特性提供有价值的证据。

Abstract: Intransitive verbs fall into two different syntactic classes, unergatives and unaccusatives. It has long been argued that verbs describing an agentive action are more likely to appear in an unergative syntax, and those describing a telic event to appear in an unaccusative syntax. However, recent work by Kim et al. (2024) found that human ratings for agentivity and telicity were a poor predictor of the syntactic behavior of intransitives. Here we revisit this question using interpretable dimensions, computed from seed words on opposite poles of the agentive and telic scales. Our findings support the link between unergativity/unaccusativity and agentivity/telicity, and demonstrate that using interpretable dimensions in conjunction with human judgments can offer valuable evidence for semantic properties that are not easily evaluated in rating tasks.

TL;DR: PEPPER是一种针对文本到图像扩散模型后门攻击的防御方法，通过重写输入提示来破坏嵌入的触发器，同时保持视觉相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型容易受到后门攻击，攻击者可以通过在输入提示中植入触发器来引导生成有害或意外内容。

Method: PEPPER通过将输入提示重写为语义上不同但视觉上相似的提示，并添加不显眼的元素，来破坏嵌入的触发器并稀释触发词的影响。

Result: 实验表明PEPPER对基于文本编码器的攻击特别有效，显著降低攻击成功率同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: PEPPER可以与现有防御方法结合使用，提供比任何单独方法更强且更通用的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent studies show that text to image (T2I) diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where a trigger in the input prompt can steer generation toward harmful or unintended content. To address this, we introduce PEPPER (PErcePtion Guided PERturbation), a backdoor defense that rewrites the caption into a semantically distant yet visually similar caption while adding unobstructive elements. With this rewriting strategy, PEPPER disrupt the trigger embedded in the input prompt, dilute the influence of trigger tokens and thereby achieve enhanced robustness. Experiments show that PEPPER is particularly effective against text encoder based attacks, substantially reducing attack success while preserving generation quality. Beyond this, PEPPER can be paired with any existing defenses yielding consistently stronger and generalizable robustness than any standalone method. Our code will be released on Github.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需参考标准的LLM响应简洁性评估指标，通过三种压缩比计算来量化非必要内容


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM经常生成冗长冗余的响应，降低了清晰度和用户满意度，并增加了模型开发成本

Method: 计算三个压缩比的平均值：原始响应与抽象摘要的压缩比、原始响应与抽取摘要的压缩比、以及通过LLM删除非必要词语的压缩比

Result: 实验结果表明该指标能有效识别LLM输出中的冗余内容

Conclusion: 该指标为对话AI系统提供了一种无需人工标注的自动化响应简洁性评估工具

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate responses that are lengthy and verbose, filled with redundant or unnecessary details. This diminishes clarity and user satisfaction, and it increases costs for model developers, especially with well-known proprietary models that charge based on the number of output tokens. In this paper, we introduce a novel reference-free metric for evaluating the conciseness of responses generated by LLMs. Our method quantifies non-essential content without relying on gold standard references and calculates the average of three calculations: i) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM abstractive summary; ii) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM extractive summary; and iii) wordremoval compression, where an LLM removes as many non-essential words as possible from the response while preserving its meaning, with the number of tokens removed indicating the conciseness score. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed metric identifies redundancy in LLM outputs, offering a practical tool for automated evaluation of response brevity in conversational AI systems without the need for ground truth human annotations.

*Kang Wang,Xiangyu Duan,Tianyi Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Soft Concept Mixing (SCM)训练方案，通过在训练中直接暴露软概念表示来弥合推理中的软概念与训练中离散标记之间的差距，提升LLMs的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs通常通过生成离散标记进行推理，这限制了其表达能力。虽然软概念推理是很有前景的方向，但LLMs是在离散标记上训练的，存在软概念推理与离散标记训练之间的差距。

Method: SCM构建软概念向量（嵌入的概率加权平均），将其混合到模型的隐藏状态中，并使用强化学习优化整个潜在推理过程。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试上的实验表明，SCM提高了LLMs的推理性能，同时保持了稳定的训练动态。

Conclusion: SCM通过软概念感知训练有效提升了LLMs的推理能力，弥合了软概念推理与离散标记训练之间的差距。

Abstract: Unlike human reasoning in abstract conceptual spaces, large language models (LLMs) typically reason by generating discrete tokens, which potentially limit their expressive power. The recent work Soft Thinking has shown that LLMs' latent reasoning via soft concepts is a promising direction, but LLMs are trained on discrete tokens. To reduce this gap between the soft concepts in reasoning and the discrete tokens in training, we propose Soft Concept Mixing (SCM), a soft concept aware training scheme that directly exposes the model to soft representations during training. Specifically, SCM constructs a soft concept vector by forming a probability-weighted average of embeddings. Then, this vector is mixed into the model's hidden states, which embody rich contextual information. Finally, the entire latent reasoning process is optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SCM improves the reasoning performance of LLMs, and simultaneously maintains a stable training dynamic.

Motivation: 探索如何以最小改动进一步提高小型循环架构（如TRM）在复杂推理任务上的效率，特别是在ARC任务上的表现。

Method: 将TRM的潜在推理框架为分类器自由引导和隐式策略改进算法，提出为每个训练循环提供目标的新训练方案。

Result: 方法将总前向传播次数减少18倍，消除了停止机制，在仅0.8M参数下在ARC-1上达到24%准确率，优于大多数LLM。

Conclusion: 提出的训练方案显著提升了TRM的训练效率，在保持性能的同时大幅减少了计算开销，证明了小型模型在复杂推理任务上的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, it was shown that small, looped architectures, such as Tiny Recursive Models (TRMs), can outperform Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, including the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this work, we investigate a core question: how can we further improve the efficiency of these methods with minimal changes? To address this, we frame the latent reasoning of TRMs as a form of classifier-free guidance and implicit policy improvement algorithm. Building on these insights, we propose a novel training scheme that provides a target for each loop during training. We demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances training efficiency. Our method reduces the total number of forward passes by 18x and eliminates halting mechanisms, while maintaining quality comparable to standard TRMs. Notably, we achieve 24% accuracy on ARC-1 with only 0.8M parameters, outperforming most LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了训练数据的统计特性（包括自然和合成数据）与归纳头（IHs）形成之间的关系，发现批次大小和上下文大小的简单方程可以预测IHs的形成点，表面二元重复频率和可靠性强烈影响IHs形成，并找到了这些值的精确帕累托边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然专门的注意力头（称为归纳头）被认为是现代语言模型卓越上下文学习能力的基础，但其形成的精确特征仍不清楚。本研究旨在阐明训练数据统计特性与IHs形成之间的关系。

Method: 通过分析自然和合成训练数据的统计特性，研究批次大小、上下文大小、表面二元重复频率和可靠性对IHs形成的影响，并建立预测方程和帕累托边界。

Result: 发现批次大小和上下文大小的简单方程可以预测IHs形成点；表面二元重复频率和可靠性强烈影响IHs形成，存在精确的帕累托边界；当频率和可靠性高时，局部依赖性足以形成IHs，但当这些值低时，分类性和边际分布形状变得重要。

Conclusion: 训练数据的统计特性（特别是二元重复频率和可靠性）对归纳头的形成具有决定性影响，这些发现为理解语言模型上下文学习能力的机制提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Arguably, specialized attention heads dubbed induction heads (IHs) underlie the remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of modern language models (LMs); yet, a precise characterization of their formation remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the relationship between statistical properties of training data (for both natural and synthetic data) and IH formation. We show that (1) a simple equation combining batch size and context size predicts the point at which IHs form; (2) surface bigram repetition frequency and reliability strongly affect the formation of IHs, and we find a precise Pareto frontier in terms of these two values; and (3) local dependency with high bigram repetition frequency and reliability is sufficient for IH formation, but when the frequency and reliability are low, categoriality and the shape of the marginal distribution matter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话摘要方法忽视了论点结构，无法揭示句子内部的深层论点关系，需要一种能同时捕捉论点结构和量化支持度的摘要方法。

Method: ARQUSUMM框架：1）利用LLM少样本学习识别句子中的命题及其论点-理由关系；2）采用论点结构感知聚类算法聚合论点并量化支持度。

Result: ARQUSUMM在对话和定量摘要任务上优于现有模型，生成的摘要具有更好的论点结构表示、更高的文本质量和量化准确性。

Conclusion: ARQUSUMM成功解决了论点感知定量摘要任务，能生成对用户更有帮助的、包含论点结构和量化信息的对话摘要。

Abstract: Online conversations have become more prevalent on public discussion platforms (e.g. Reddit). With growing controversial topics, it is desirable to summarize not only diverse arguments, but also their rationale and justification. Early studies on text summarization focus on capturing general salient information in source documents, overlooking the argumentative nature of online conversations. Recent research on conversation summarization although considers the argumentative relationship among sentences, fail to explicate deeper argument structure within sentences for summarization. In this paper, we propose a novel task of argument-aware quantitative summarization to reveal the claim-reason structure of arguments in conversations, with quantities measuring argument strength. We further propose ARQUSUMM, a novel framework to address the task. To reveal the underlying argument structure within sentences, ARQUSUMM leverages LLM few-shot learning grounded in the argumentation theory to identify propositions within sentences and their claim-reason relationships. For quantitative summarization, ARQUSUMM employs argument structure-aware clustering algorithms to aggregate arguments and quantify their support. Experiments show that ARQUSUMM outperforms existing conversation and quantitative summarization models and generate summaries representing argument structures that are more helpful to users, of high textual quality and quantification accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 湖南历史名人的系统数据资源有限，通用模型在领域知识提取和结构化输出生成方面表现不佳，需要专门的方法来提升在低资源环境下的信息提取能力。

Method: 设计针对湖南历史名人领域的细粒度模式引导指令模板，构建指令调优数据集，并对四个公开大型语言模型进行参数高效的指令微调。

Result: 所有模型在微调后都表现出显著的性能提升，其中Qwen3-8B表现最佳，在100个样本和50次训练迭代下达到89.3866分。

Conclusion: 本研究为垂直领域大型语言模型的微调提供了新思路，展示了其在文化遗产知识提取和知识图谱构建中具有成本效益的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models and knowledge graphs offer strong potential for advancing research on historical culture by supporting the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of cultural heritage. Using Hunan's modern historical celebrities shaped by Huxiang culture as a case study, pre-trained large models can help researchers efficiently extract key information, including biographical attributes, life events, and social relationships, from textual sources and construct structured knowledge graphs. However, systematic data resources for Hunan's historical celebrities remain limited, and general-purpose models often underperform in domain knowledge extraction and structured output generation in such low-resource settings. To address these issues, this study proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach for enhancing domain-specific information extraction. First, we design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template tailored to the Hunan historical celebrities domain and build an instruction-tuning dataset to mitigate the lack of domain-specific training corpora. Second, we apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four publicly available large language models - Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct - and develop evaluation criteria for assessing their extraction performance. Experimental results show that all models exhibit substantial performance gains after fine-tuning. Among them, Qwen3-8B achieves the strongest results, reaching a score of 89.3866 with 100 samples and 50 training iterations. This study provides new insights into fine-tuning vertical large language models for regional historical and cultural domains and highlights their potential for cost-effective applications in cultural heritage knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction.

TL;DR: 该研究构建了视觉说服力判断数据集，分析视觉语言模型对视觉说服因素的理解能力，发现模型存在召回偏向，且主要通过高层语义对齐来判断说服力，而非低中层视觉特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究视觉语言模型是否真正理解视觉说服——即视觉线索如何影响人类态度和决策，目前尚不清楚。

Method: 构建二元说服力判断数据集，引入视觉说服因素分类法（包括低层感知、中层构图和高层语义线索），探索认知引导和知识注入策略。

Result: VLMs存在召回偏向（过度预测高说服力），对低中层特征判别能力弱，高层语义对齐是最强预测因子。简洁、基于对象的理由能显著提升精度和F1分数。

Conclusion: VLMs的核心局限不在于识别说服性对象，而在于将其与沟通意图联系起来。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive multi-modal reasoning and understanding. Yet, whether these models truly grasp visual persuasion-how visual cues shape human attitudes and decisions-remains unclear. To probe this question, we construct a high-consensus dataset for binary persuasiveness judgment and introduce the taxonomy of Visual Persuasive Factors (VPFs), encompassing low-level perceptual, mid-level compositional, and high-level semantic cues. We also explore cognitive steering and knowledge injection strategies for persuasion-relevant reasoning. Empirical analysis across VLMs reveals a recall-oriented bias-models over-predict high persuasiveness-and weak discriminative power for low/mid-level features. In contrast, high-level semantic alignment between message and object presence emerges as the strongest predictor of human judgment. Among intervention strategies, simple instruction or unguided reasoning scaffolds yield marginal or negative effects, whereas concise, object-grounded rationales significantly improve precision and F1 scores. These results indicate that VLMs core limitation lies not in recognizing persuasive objects but in linking them to communicative intent.

Motivation: 解决大规模真实评估中对透明可解释自动评分系统的需求，目前缺乏广泛接受的可解释自动评分解决方案。

Method: AnalyticScore框架：1)提取明确可识别的回答元素；2)使用LLM将回答特征化为人类可解释的值；3)应用直观的有序逻辑回归模型进行评分。

Result: 在ASAP-SAS数据集的10个项目上，AnalyticScore的评分准确率优于许多不可解释方法，平均仅比不可解释SOTA低0.06 QWK；特征化行为与人类标注者高度一致。

Conclusion: 提出的FGTI原则和AnalyticScore框架证明了实现可解释自动评分的可行性，为未来研究提供了基准参考框架。

Abstract: AI-driven automated scoring systems offer scalable and efficient means of evaluating complex student-generated responses. Yet, despite increasing demand for transparency and interpretability, the field has yet to develop a widely accepted solution for interpretable automated scoring to be used in large-scale real-world assessments. This work takes a principled approach to address this challenge. We analyze the needs and potential benefits of interpretable automated scoring for various assessment stakeholders and develop four principles of interpretability -- Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI) -- targeted at those needs. To illustrate the feasibility of implementing these principles, we develop the AnalyticScore framework for short answer scoring as a baseline reference framework for future research. AnalyticScore operates by (1) extracting explicitly identifiable elements of the responses, (2) featurizing each response into human-interpretable values using LLMs, and (3) applying an intuitive ordinal logistic regression model for scoring. In terms of scoring accuracy, AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable scoring methods, and is within only 0.06 QWK of the uninterpretable SOTA on average across 10 items from the ASAP-SAS dataset. By comparing against human annotators conducting the same featurization task, we further demonstrate that the featurization behavior of AnalyticScore aligns well with that of humans.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型缺乏可靠性的问题，为声明级不确定性量化方法提供公平和可复现的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含四种欧洲语言的4,873个样本数据集，提供每个token的24个生成对数概率，并提出仅需0.2%生成时间的确定性分割算法。

Conclusion: MUCH基准为声明级不确定性量化方法的开发提供了重要工具，支持在真实约束条件下进行公平评估，推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Claim-level Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to mitigate the lack of reliability in Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce MUCH, the first claim-level UQ benchmark designed for fair and reproducible evaluation of future methods under realistic conditions. It includes 4,873 samples across four European languages (English, French, Spanish, and German) and four instruction-tuned open-weight LLMs. Unlike prior claim-level benchmarks, we release 24 generation logits per token, facilitating the development of future white-box methods without re-generating data. Moreover, in contrast to previous benchmarks that rely on manual or LLM-based segmentation, we propose a new deterministic algorithm capable of segmenting claims using as little as 0.2% of the LLM generation time. This makes our segmentation approach suitable for real-time monitoring of LLM outputs, ensuring that MUCH evaluates UQ methods under realistic deployment constraints. Finally, our evaluations show that current methods still have substantial room for improvement in both performance and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有LLM主要针对因果建模和下一个token预测优化，不适合生成整体文本表示。虽然已有研究引入预训练任务来适应LLM，但大多依赖token级预测目标，存在局限性。

Method: 提出上下文压缩预训练任务，让模型学习生成紧凑的记忆token来替代整个上下文进行下游序列预测。结合对比学习进一步改进表示质量。

Conclusion: 上下文压缩是一种有效的预训练任务，能够提升LLM的文本表示能力，在保持高性能的同时提高样本效率。

Abstract: Text representation plays a critical role in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and other downstream applications. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.

Despite advances in neural machine translation (NMT), the development of effective APE systems has been hindered by the lack of large-scale multilingual datasets specifically tailored to NMT outputs. To address this gap, we present and release LangMark, a new human-annotated multilingual APE dataset for English translation to seven languages: Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. The dataset has 206,983 triplets, with each triplet consisting of a source segment, its NMT output, and a human post-edited translation. Annotated by expert human linguists, our dataset offers both linguistic diversity and scale. Leveraging this dataset, we empirically show that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting can effectively perform APE, improving upon leading commercial and even proprietary machine translation systems. We believe that this new resource will facilitate the future development and evaluation of APE systems.

TL;DR: ABCA是一个基于因果推断的早期弃权框架，通过分析LLM内部知识多样性来评估查询可靠性，实现两种类型的弃权决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弃权方法依赖生成后信号，无法提前阻止不可靠响应。需要一种能够在生成前评估知识可靠性的早期弃权机制。

Method: ABCA框架通过因果推断分析LLM内部知识的多方面多样性（如学科、法律背景、时间框架），估计条件因果效应来评估知识可靠性。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ABCA提高了弃权可靠性，达到最先进性能，并增强了弃权决策的可解释性。

Conclusion: ABCA通过基于方面的因果分析实现了有效的早期弃权，解决了LLM幻觉问题，同时提供了更可靠的弃权决策和更好的可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent but factually incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Abstention, where the model chooses not to answer and instead outputs phrases such as "I don't know", is a common safeguard. However, existing abstention methods typically rely on post-generation signals, such as generation variations or feedback, which limits their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. In this paper, we introduce Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA), a new framework that enables early abstention by analysing the internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference. This diversity reflects the multifaceted nature of parametric knowledge acquired from various sources, representing diverse aspects such as disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. ABCA estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess the reliability of knowledge relevant to a given query. Based on these estimates, we enable two types of abstention: Type-1, where aspect effects are inconsistent (knowledge conflict), and Type-2, where aspect effects consistently support abstention (knowledge insufficiency). Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances the interpretability of abstention decisions.

*Mohammad Zare*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种注意力引导特征融合(AGFF)模型，将统计特征和语义特征结合，通过注意力机制动态确定各特征类型的重要性，在新闻分类任务中优于传统统计模型和纯语义深度学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计方法无法捕捉上下文语义，而现代深度学习方法可能忽略简单但高影响力的统计指标，需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 使用注意力引导特征融合框架，通过注意力机制动态融合统计特征和语义特征，平衡两者的互补优势。

Result: 在基准新闻数据集上，AGFF模型表现出优于传统统计模型和纯语义深度学习模型的性能，显著提高了分类准确率。

Conclusion: 策略性地整合多样化特征类型可以显著增强分类性能，AGFF模型能够有效平衡和利用统计与语义表示的互补优势，是实际新闻分类任务的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: News text classification is a crucial task in natural language processing, essential for organizing and filtering the massive volume of digital content. Traditional methods typically rely on statistical features like term frequencies or TF-IDF values, which are effective at capturing word-level importance but often fail to reflect contextual meaning. In contrast, modern deep learning approaches utilize semantic features to understand word usage within context, yet they may overlook simple, high-impact statistical indicators. This paper introduces an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features in a unified framework. The model applies an attention-based mechanism to dynamically determine the relative importance of each feature type, enabling more informed classification decisions. Through evaluation on benchmark news datasets, the AGFF model demonstrates superior performance compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models. The results confirm that strategic integration of diverse feature types can significantly enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, ablation studies validate the contribution of each component in the fusion process. The findings highlight the model's ability to balance and exploit the complementary strengths of statistical and semantic representations, making it a practical and effective solution for real-world news classification tasks.

TL;DR: AutoLink是一个自主代理框架，将模式链接重新定义为迭代的代理驱动过程，通过动态探索和扩展链接模式子集来解决工业级文本到SQL中的模式链接问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业级文本到SQL中，由于上下文窗口限制和无关噪声，将整个数据库模式提供给大型语言模型是不切实际的。现有方法成本高昂，难以平衡召回率和噪声，且在大规模数据库上扩展性差。

Method: AutoLink采用自主代理框架，由LLM引导动态探索和扩展链接模式子集，迭代识别必要的模式组件，无需输入完整数据库模式。

Result: 在Bird-Dev上实现97.4%的严格模式链接召回率，在Spider-2.0-Lite上达到91.2%，执行准确率分别为68.7%和34.9%，在大规模模式（如超过3000列）上保持高召回率和高效令牌消耗。

Conclusion: AutoLink是一个高度可扩展、高召回率的模式链接解决方案，适用于工业文本到SQL系统，在大规模模式上表现出色。

Abstract: For industrial-scale text-to-SQL, supplying the entire database schema to Large Language Models (LLMs) is impractical due to context window limits and irrelevant noise. Schema linking, which filters the schema to a relevant subset, is therefore critical. However, existing methods incur prohibitive costs, struggle to trade off recall and noise, and scale poorly to large databases. We present \textbf{AutoLink}, an autonomous agent framework that reformulates schema linking as an iterative, agent-driven process. Guided by an LLM, AutoLink dynamically explores and expands the linked schema subset, progressively identifying necessary schema components without inputting the full database schema. Our experiments demonstrate AutoLink's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art strict schema linking recall of \textbf{97.4\%} on Bird-Dev and \textbf{91.2\%} on Spider-2.0-Lite, with competitive execution accuracy, i.e., \textbf{68.7\%} EX on Bird-Dev (better than CHESS) and \textbf{34.9\%} EX on Spider-2.0-Lite (ranking 2nd on the official leaderboard). Crucially, AutoLink exhibits \textbf{exceptional scalability}, \textbf{maintaining high recall}, \textbf{efficient token consumption}, and \textbf{robust execution accuracy} on large schemas (e.g., over 3,000 columns) where existing methods severely degrade-making it a highly scalable, high-recall schema-linking solution for industrial text-to-SQL systems.

TL;DR: 提出E3LayerPruning框架，通过可微分掩码优化和熵感知知识蒸馏，实现高效、经济、快速的层剪枝，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低训练成本和提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有层剪枝方法难以同时解决性能下降、训练成本高和加速有限等实际部署挑战，需要开发更实用的压缩方案。

Method: 使用Gumbel-TopK采样器进行可微分掩码优化，结合熵感知自适应知识蒸馏策略，实现精确的剪枝掩码搜索和任务性能提升。

Result: 在Qwen3-32B模型上剪枝25%层后，MATH-500准确率达到96%，仅比原模型下降0.8%，推理速度提升1.33倍，仅使用0.5B tokens（后训练数据量的0.5%）。

Conclusion: E3LayerPruning框架在性能、训练成本和推理效率方面均优于现有方法，为大规模语言模型的实用部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing size of large language models, layer pruning has gained increased attention as a hardware-friendly approach for model compression. However, existing layer pruning methods struggle to simultaneously address key practical deployment challenges, including performance degradation, high training costs, and limited acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we propose \name, a task-\underline{E}ffective, training-\underline{E}conomical and inference-\underline{E}fficient layer pruning framework. \namespace introduces two key innovations: (1) a differentiable mask optimization method using a Gumbel-TopK sampler, enabling efficient and precise pruning mask search; and (2) an entropy-aware adaptive knowledge distillation strategy that enhances task performance. Extensive experiments over diverse model architectures and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, \namespace achieves 96\% accuracy, a mere 0.8\% drop from the original model (96.8\%) on MATH-500 when pruning 25\% layers of Qwen3-32B, outperforming existing SOTA (95\%), with a 1.33$\times$ inference speedup by consuming merely 0.5B tokens (0.5\% of the post-training data volume).

*Sizhe Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件语义的对话记忆方法，将对话历史表示为简短的事件命题，通过异构图组织支持关联检索，在保持信息完整性的同时提升长期对话的连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM对话代理在长期对话中面临的挑战：固定上下文窗口限制历史记忆，现有外部记忆方法要么检索粒度太粗要么过于碎片化，缺乏既能保持信息完整性又便于访问的解决方案。

Method: 将每个对话会话分解为丰富的基本话语单元（EDUs）——包含标准化实体和来源回合的自包含语句，并在异构图中组织会话、EDUs及其参数，支持关联检索。构建了两种基于检索的变体：密集相似性搜索和LLM过滤，可选图传播步骤连接相关EDUs。

Result: 在LoCoMo和LongMemEval$_S$基准测试中，这种事件中心记忆方法达到或超越了强基线，同时使用更短的QA上下文。

Conclusion: 结构简单的事件级记忆为长期对话代理提供了原则性和实用的基础，能够在保持信息非压缩形式的同时提高可访问性。

Abstract: LLM-based conversational agents still struggle to maintain coherent, personalized interaction over many sessions: fixed context windows limit how much history can be kept in view, and most external memory approaches trade off between coarse retrieval over large chunks and fine-grained but fragmented views of the dialogue. Motivated by neo-Davidsonian event semantics, we propose an event-centric alternative that represents conversational history as short, event-like propositions which bundle together participants, temporal cues, and minimal local context, rather than as independent relation triples or opaque summaries. In contrast to work that aggressively compresses or forgets past content, our design aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form and make it more accessible, rather than more lossy. Concretely, we instruct an LLM to decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) -- self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions -- and organize sessions, EDUs, and their arguments in a heterogeneous graph that supports associative recall. On top of this representation we build two simple retrieval-based variants that use dense similarity search and LLM filtering, with an optional graph-based propagation step to connect and aggregate evidence across related EDUs. Experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that these event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines, while operating with much shorter QA contexts. Our results suggest that structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/KevinSRR/EMem.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在权威压力下过度顺从（谄媚）的现象，评估模型在真实世界部署中对社会压力的抵抗能力。

Method: 使用PARROT框架：(i)双盲评估比较中性问题和权威性错误问题；(ii)基于对数似然的置信度校准追踪；(iii)八状态行为分类法系统分类失败模式。

Result: 评估22个模型发现显著异质性：先进模型（GPT-5、GPT-4.1等）跟随率低（≤11%），准确性损失小；老旧/小模型出现严重认知崩溃（GPT-4:80%，Qwen 2.5-1.5B:94%）。国际法和全球知识领域脆弱，初等数学相对稳健。

Conclusion: 抵抗过度拟合压力应作为模型安全部署的主要目标之一，与准确性、伤害避免和隐私同等重要。

Abstract: This study presents PARROT (Persuasion and Agreement Robustness Rating of Output Truth), a robustness focused framework designed to measure the degradation in accuracy that occurs under social pressure exerted on users through authority and persuasion in large language models (LLMs) the phenomenon of sycophancy (excessive conformity). PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low "follow rates" ($\leq 11\%$, GPT-5: 4\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient. Consequently, we argue that the goal of "resistance to overfitting pressure" should be addressed as a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe deployment in the real world.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MirageTVQA是一个新的基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在多语言和视觉噪声表格上的推理能力，揭示了现有模型在视觉噪声处理和多语言推理方面的严重缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格问答数据集主要是英文且格式完美，与现实场景存在显著差距，需要评估模型在多语言和视觉噪声条件下的实际表现。

Method: 创建包含近60,000个问答对、覆盖24种语言的MirageTVQA基准测试，其中表格包含模拟扫描文档的视觉噪声。

Result: 领先的VLM在视觉噪声下性能下降超过35%，且存在明显的英语优先偏见，在其他语言上的推理能力无法有效迁移。

Conclusion: MirageTVQA为衡量和推动更鲁棒的表格推理VLM模型提供了基准，揭示了当前模型在现实场景中的局限性。

Abstract: The impressive performance of VLMs is largely measured on benchmarks that fail to capture the complexities of real-world scenarios. Existing datasets for tabular QA, such as WikiTableQuestions and FinQA, are overwhelmingly monolingual (English) and present tables in a digitally perfect, clean format. This creates a significant gap between research and practice. To address this, we present \textbf{MirageTVQA}, a new benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs on these exact dimensions. Featuring nearly 60,000 QA pairs across 24 languages, MirageTVQA challenges models with tables that are not only multilingual but also visually imperfect, incorporating realistic noise to mimic scanned documents. Our evaluation of the leading VLMs reveals two primary failure points: a severe degradation in performance (over 35\% drop for the best models) when faced with visual noise and a consistent English-first bias where reasoning abilities fail to transfer to other languages. MirageTVQA provides a benchmark for measuring and driving progress towards more robust VLM models for table reasoning. The dataset and the code are available at: https://github.com/anshulsc/MirageTVQA.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合方法预测社交媒体用户行为，涵盖常见和罕见行为，在Bluesky数据集上验证了有效性，在SocialSim挑战赛中获第一名


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注常见行为如转发和点赞，但对罕见但重要行为的预测研究不足，需要开发能同时处理频繁和不频繁行为的预测方法

Method: 结合四种互补方法：基于历史响应模式的查找数据库系统、针对常见行为的个性化LightGBM模型、融合文本和时间表示的混合神经网络架构用于罕见行为分类、文本回复生成

Result: 个性化模型在常见行为预测上平均宏F1得分为0.64，罕见行为分类器在10种罕见行为上宏F1得分为0.56

Conclusion: 有效的社交媒体行为预测需要针对不同类型行为的定制建模策略，识别行为类型间的根本差异

Abstract: Understanding and predicting user behavior on social media platforms is crucial for content recommendation and platform design. While existing approaches focus primarily on common actions like retweeting and liking, the prediction of rare but significant behaviors remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a hybrid methodology for social media user behavior prediction that addresses both frequent and infrequent actions across a diverse action vocabulary. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale Bluesky dataset containing 6.4 million conversation threads spanning 12 distinct user actions across 25 persona clusters. Our methodology combines four complementary approaches: (i) a lookup database system based on historical response patterns; (ii) persona-specific LightGBM models with engineered temporal and semantic features for common actions; (iii) a specialized hybrid neural architecture fusing textual and temporal representations for rare action classification; and (iv) generation of text replies. Our persona-specific models achieve an average macro F1-score of 0.64 for common action prediction, while our rare action classifier achieves 0.56 macro F1-score across 10 rare actions. These results demonstrate that effective social media behavior prediction requires tailored modeling strategies recognizing fundamental differences between action types. Our approach achieved first place in the SocialSim: Social-Media Based Personas challenge organized at the Social Simulation with LLMs workshop at COLM 2025.

Result: 结果显示：1) 模型在人工翻译的爱沙尼亚语数据集上表现略低于原始英语测试集；2) 在机器翻译数据上表现明显更差；3) 提示工程对翻译质量或模型准确性的改进有限。

Conclusion: 结论强调了语言专家参与数据集翻译和适配的重要性，以确保对大型语言模型语言能力和推理的可靠、可解释评估，机器翻译和提示工程在当前阶段无法替代人工翻译的质量。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a localized and culturally adapted Estonian translation of the test set from the widely used commonsense reasoning benchmark, WinoGrande. We detail the translation and adaptation process carried out by translation specialists and evaluate the performance of both proprietary and open source models on the human translated benchmark. Additionally, we explore the feasibility of achieving high-quality machine translation by incorporating insights from the manual translation process into the design of a detailed prompt. This prompt is specifically tailored to address both the linguistic characteristics of Estonian and the unique translation challenges posed by the WinoGrande dataset. Our findings show that model performance on the human translated Estonian dataset is slightly lower than on the original English test set, while performance on machine-translated data is notably worse. Additionally, our experiments indicate that prompt engineering offers limited improvement in translation quality or model accuracy, and highlight the importance of involving language specialists in dataset translation and adaptation to ensure reliable and interpretable evaluations of language competency and reasoning in large language models.

Motivation: 在多元语言社区中，情感分析系统可以帮助政府快速识别社交媒体中的社会挑战。虽然LLMs在英语情感分析中表现出色，但尚未有研究探索其在南非语言中的应用。

Method: 分析五种最先进LLMs在10个南非政府部门管辖范围内的10个新兴话题的英语、塞佩迪语和茨瓦纳语社交媒体帖子中的零样本情感分析性能，并研究模型融合策略。

Result: 不同LLMs、话题和语言之间存在显著差异。通过融合不同模型的输出，情感分类错误率可降至1%以下，大幅提升分类性能。

Conclusion: 现在可以构建可靠的情感分析系统来检测社会挑战，并为特定话题和不同语言群体提供行动需求分析。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis can aid in understanding people's opinions and emotions on social issues. In multilingual communities sentiment analysis systems can be used to quickly identify social challenges in social media posts, enabling government departments to detect and address these issues more precisely and effectively. Recently, large-language models (LLMs) have become available to the wide public and initial analyses have shown that they exhibit magnificent zero-shot sentiment analysis abilities in English. However, there is no work that has investigated to leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis on social media posts in South African languages and detect social challenges. Consequently, in this work, we analyse the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMa 2, PaLM 2, and Dolly 2 to investigate the sentiment polarities of the 10 most emerging topics in English, Sepedi and Setswana social media posts that fall within the jurisdictional areas of 10 South African government departments. Our results demonstrate that there are big differences between the various LLMs, topics, and languages. In addition, we show that a fusion of the outcomes of different LLMs provides large gains in sentiment classification performance with sentiment classification errors below 1%. Consequently, it is now feasible to provide systems that generate reliable information about sentiment analysis to detect social challenges and draw conclusions about possible needs for actions on specific topics and within different language groups.

TL;DR: 提出了HUMA系统，一个基于LLM的多用户对话代理，能够在群聊中使用类似人类的策略和时机进行交流，在实验中参与者难以区分AI与人类社区管理者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数对话系统设计为一对一、回合制交流，而AI助手在数字平台中日益普及，开发自然、类似人类的交互模式对于维持用户信任和参与度至关重要。

Method: HUMA采用事件驱动架构，包含Router、Action Agent和Reflection三个组件，处理消息、回复、反应，并引入真实的响应时间模拟，将LLM适应到群聊动态中。

Result: 在97名参与者的四人角色扮演聊天研究中，参与者对AI和人类社区管理者的分类准确率接近随机水平，无法可靠区分HUMA代理与人类。主观体验在两种条件下相当，社区管理者有效性、社交存在感和参与满意度差异很小。

Conclusion: 在自然群聊环境中，AI协调者能够达到人类质量水平，同时难以被识别为非人类。

Abstract: Conversational agents built on large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet most systems are designed for one-on-one, turn-based exchanges rather than natural, asynchronous group chats. As AI assistants become widespread throughout digital platforms, from virtual assistants to customer service, developing natural and humanlike interaction patterns seems crucial for maintaining user trust and engagement. We present the Humanlike Multi-user Agent (HUMA), an LLM-based facilitator that participates in multi-party conversations using human-like strategies and timing. HUMA extends prior multi-user chatbot work with an event-driven architecture that handles messages, replies, reactions and introduces realistic response-time simulation. HUMA comprises three components-Router, Action Agent, and Reflection-which together adapt LLMs to group conversation dynamics.
  We evaluate HUMA in a controlled study with 97 participants in four-person role-play chats, comparing AI and human community managers (CMs). Participants classified CMs as human at near-chance rates in both conditions, indicating they could not reliably distinguish HUMA agents from humans. Subjective experience was comparable across conditions: community-manager effectiveness, social presence, and engagement/satisfaction differed only modestly with small effect sizes. Our results suggest that, in natural group chat settings, an AI facilitator can match human quality while remaining difficult to identify as nonhuman.

TL;DR: 该研究基于语料库分析普通话单音节词在自然对话中的音高轮廓，发现即使控制多种变量后，词义仍是音调实现的重要预测因素，语义效应强于词汇本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索普通话单音节词在自然对话中的音高轮廓实现方式，特别关注词义对音调的影响，挑战传统的普通话声调理论。

Method: 使用广义加性模型分解观测到的音高轮廓，将其分解为与不同控制变量和语义预测因子相关的组成音高轮廓，控制变量包括词长、性别、说话者身份、声调语境、元音高度和话语位置等。

Result: 词义效应是音调实现的强预测因素，词义比词汇本身是更好的预测因子，异形同音词具有不同的音高轮廓，使用上下文嵌入可以显著超过置换基线的准确度预测单个词标记的音高轮廓。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了标准的普通话声调理论，但符合判别性词典模型的理论框架，表明分布语义学在语音学中是一个新的重要因素。

Abstract: We present a corpus-based investigation of how the pitch contours of monosyllabic words are realized in spontaneous conversational Mandarin, focusing on the effects of words' meanings. We used the generalized additive model to decompose a given observed pitch contour into a set of component pitch contours that are tied to different control variables and semantic predictors. Even when variables such as word duration, gender, speaker identity, tonal context, vowel height, and utterance position are controlled for, the effect of word remains a strong predictor of tonal realization. We present evidence that this effect of word is a semantic effect: word sense is shown to be a better predictor than word, and heterographic homophones are shown to have different pitch contours. The strongest evidence for the importance of semantics is that the pitch contours of individual word tokens can be predicted from their contextualized embeddings with an accuracy that substantially exceeds a permutation baseline. For phonetics, distributional semantics is a new kid on the block. Although our findings challenge standard theories of Mandarin tone, they fit well within the theoretical framework of the Discriminative Lexicon Model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用多模态表示来增强自然语言推理的鲁棒性，避免文本偏见和表面启发式的影响。

Method: 使用文本到图像模型生成前提的视觉表示，通过余弦相似度和视觉问答两种技术进行推理比较。

Result: 该方法在不进行任务特定微调的情况下实现了高准确率，并设计对抗性数据集验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 利用视觉模态作为意义表示为鲁棒的自然语言理解提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We propose a zero-shot method for Natural Language Inference (NLI) that leverages multimodal representations by grounding language in visual contexts. Our approach generates visual representations of premises using text-to-image models and performs inference by comparing these representations with textual hypotheses. We evaluate two inference techniques: cosine similarity and visual question answering. Our method achieves high accuracy without task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating robustness against textual biases and surface heuristics. Additionally, we design a controlled adversarial dataset to validate the robustness of our approach. Our findings suggest that leveraging visual modality as a meaning representation provides a promising direction for robust natural language understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Selective RoPE的输入依赖旋转位置嵌入机制，该机制将RoPE推广到任意旋转角度，适用于线性和softmax变换器，并在语言建模和序列任务中表现出性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到线性变换器中输入依赖门控机制能改善语言相关任务的启发，希望将这种选择性机制引入到位置编码中，以增强模型对位置信息的处理能力。

Method: 开发了Selective RoPE机制，这是一种输入依赖的旋转嵌入方法，能够实现任意角度的旋转，并揭示了softmax注意力中隐藏的旋转操作以及状态空间模型中实部和虚部分别处理遗忘和位置编码的机制。

Result: 通过在门控变换器中装备Selective RoPE，验证了该方法在语言建模以及复制、状态跟踪和检索等困难序列任务上的性能提升。

Conclusion: Selective RoPE成功地将输入依赖的旋转机制引入位置编码，不仅推广了传统的RoPE方法，还揭示了注意力机制中隐含的位置结构，为改进变换器模型的位置处理能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Position information is essential for language modeling. In softmax transformers, Rotary Position Embeddings (\textit{RoPE}) encode positions through \textit{fixed-angle} rotations, while in linear transformers, order is handled via input-dependent (selective) gating that decays past key-value associations. Selectivity has generally been shown to improve language-related tasks. Inspired by this, we introduce \textit{Selective RoPE}, an \textit{input-dependent} rotary embedding mechanism, that generalizes \textit{RoPE}, and enables rotation in \textit{arbitrary angles} for both linear and softmax transformers. We show that softmax attention already performs a hidden form of these rotations on query-key pairs, uncovering an implicit positional structure. We further show that in state-space models and gated linear transformers, the real part manages forgetting while the imaginary part encodes positions through rotations. We validate our method by equipping gated transformers with \textit{Selective RoPE}, demonstrating that its input-dependent rotations improve performance in language modeling and on difficult sequence tasks like copying, state tracking, and retrieval.

TL;DR: ReVeL框架将多项选择题改写为开放式问题，以解决MCQA中选项泄露信号导致评估不可靠的问题，提高模型训练和评估的准确性与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多项选择题(MCQA)的选项可能泄露可利用信号，导致准确性指标不可靠，并鼓励在强化微调(RFT)中出现猜测行为。

Method: 提出ReVeL框架，将MCQA问题分类并重写为开放式问题，同时保持答案可验证性，使用GRPO对Qwen2.5-VL模型进行微调。

Result: 在ReVeL-OpenQA上训练的模型在多项选择基准测试中匹配MCQA准确率，并将OpenQA准确率提高约6个百分点；在评估中，ReVeL揭示了MCQA基准测试中高达20个百分点的分数膨胀。

Conclusion: ReVeL框架通过将MCQA转换为OpenQA，提供了更可靠的数据效率和奖励信号，改善了评估准确性，同时降低了成本和延迟。

Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) has been a popular format for evaluating and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) of modern multimodal language models. Its constrained output format allows for simplified, deterministic automatic verification. However, we find that the options may leak exploitable signals, which makes the accuracy metrics unreliable for indicating real capabilities and encourages explicit or implicit answer guessing behaviors during RFT. We propose ReVeL (Rewrite and Verify by LLM), a framework that rewrites multiple-choice questions into open-form questions while keeping answers verifiable whenever possible. The framework categorizes questions according to different answer types, apply different rewriting and verification schemes, respectively. When applied for RFT, we converted 20k MCQA examples and use GRPO to finetune Qwen2.5-VL models. Models trained on ReVeL-OpenQA match MCQA accuracy on multiple-choice benchmarks and improve OpenQA accuracy by about six percentage points, indicating better data efficiency and more robust reward signals than MCQA-based training. When used for evaluation, ReVeL also reveals up to 20 percentage points of score inflation in MCQA benchmarks (relative to OpenQA), improves judging accuracy, and reduces both cost and latency. We will release code and data publicly.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SMILE是一种新的评估指标，结合了句子级和关键词级语义理解以及关键词匹配，平衡词汇精确性和语义相关性，在文本、图像和视频QA任务中与人类判断高度相关且计算轻量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标如ROUGE、METEOR和EM过于依赖n-gram词汇相似性，缺乏深层语义理解；BERTScore和MoverScore等基于上下文嵌入的方法缺乏灵活性，且忽略了词汇相似性；LLM评估器成本高、存在偏见和不一致问题。

Method: 提出SMILE方法，整合句子级语义理解、关键词级语义理解和简单关键词匹配，形成复合评估方法，平衡词汇精确性和语义相关性。

Result: 在文本、图像和视频QA任务上的广泛基准测试表明，SMILE与人类判断高度相关，且计算轻量。

Conclusion: SMILE填补了词汇和语义评估之间的空白，提供了一种全面、高效且与人类判断一致的评估解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional evaluation metrics for textual and visual question answering, like ROUGE, METEOR, and Exact Match (EM), focus heavily on n-gram based lexical similarity, often missing the deeper semantic understanding needed for accurate assessment. While measures like BERTScore and MoverScore leverage contextual embeddings to address this limitation, they lack flexibility in balancing sentence-level and keyword-level semantics and ignore lexical similarity, which remains important. Large Language Model (LLM) based evaluators, though powerful, come with drawbacks like high costs, bias, inconsistency, and hallucinations. To address these issues, we introduce SMILE: Semantic Metric Integrating Lexical Exactness, a novel approach that combines sentence-level semantic understanding with keyword-level semantic understanding and easy keyword matching. This composite method balances lexical precision and semantic relevance, offering a comprehensive evaluation. Extensive benchmarks across text, image, and video QA tasks show SMILE is highly correlated with human judgments and computationally lightweight, bridging the gap between lexical and semantic evaluation.

TL;DR: MR-RLVR通过掩码填充和步骤重排序构建过程级自监督奖励，在仅结果可验证的数学推理任务中显著提升RLVR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR在定理证明等数学推理任务中扩展性有限，因为中间推理过程很重要但最终答案难以直接可靠验证，而token级SFT容易退化为死记硬背。

Method: 提出MR-RLVR，通过'掩码后填充'和'步骤重排序'构建过程级自监督奖励，采用两阶段训练：先在数学计算和证明数据上进行自监督训练，然后在仅结果可验证的数学计算数据集上进行RLVR微调。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-3B和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上评估AIME24、AIME25、AMC23和MATH500数据集，在固定采样和解码预算下，相比原始RLVR平均相对提升：Pass@1 +9.86%、Pass@5 +5.27%、Pass@8 +4.00%。

Conclusion: 引入过程感知的自监督信号能有效增强RLVR在仅结果可验证场景下的扩展性和性能。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has been shown to substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) mathematical reasoning. However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via "masked-then-fill" and "step reordering" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8. These results indicate that incorporating process-aware self-supervised signals can effectively enhance RLVR's scalability and performance in only outcome-verifiable settings.

Motivation: 传统艺术风格识别依赖艺术史学家和评论家的视觉直觉与经验，缺乏客观量化方法。数学工具的发展为艺术分析提供了结构化视角。

Method: 采用拓扑数据分析中的持续同调(PH)方法，通过分析艺术作品的高维拓扑特征来量化艺术风格。

Result: PH方法能够以统计显著性区分不同艺术家、同一艺术流派内的艺术家，并能有效区分艺术家原作与AI生成的模仿风格作品。

Conclusion: 持续同调为艺术风格分析提供了客观、可解释的量化工具，能够超越传统主观判断，在艺术鉴定和AI生成作品识别方面具有应用价值。

Abstract: Art is a deeply personal and expressive medium, where each artist brings their own style, technique, and cultural background into their work. Traditionally, identifying artistic styles has been the job of art historians or critics, relying on visual intuition and experience. However, with the advancement of mathematical tools, we can explore art through more structured lens. In this work, we show how persistent homology (PH), a method from topological data analysis, provides objective and interpretable insights on artistic styles. We show how PH can, with statistical certainty, differentiate between artists, both from different artistic currents and from the same one, and distinguish images of an artist from an AI-generated image in the artist's style.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成动物面部表情具有挑战性，因为训练图像在数量和变化上都有限，特别是在不同个体的面部表情方面。本研究聚焦于在系统神经科学和进化研究中广泛研究的猕猴。

Method: 1) 使用运动转移技术通过计算机图形学生成新的面部表情图像进行数据增强；2) 基于初始训练的StyleGAN2模型的潜在表示进行样本选择，确保训练数据集的多样性和均匀采样；3) 损失函数优化以确保准确再现细微运动（如眼球运动）。

Conclusion: 该模型具有将运动组件解耦为风格参数的潜力，为猕猴面部表情研究提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Generating animal faces using generative AI techniques is challenging because the available training images are limited both in quantity and variation, particularly for facial expressions across individuals. In this study, we focus on macaque monkeys, widely studied in systems neuroscience and evolutionary research, and propose a method to generate their facial expressions using a style-based generative image model (i.e., StyleGAN2). To address data limitations, we implemented: 1) data augmentation by synthesizing new facial expression images using a motion transfer to animate still images with computer graphics, 2) sample selection based on the latent representation of macaque faces from an initially trained StyleGAN2 model to ensure the variation and uniform sampling in training dataset, and 3) loss function refinement to ensure the accurate reproduction of subtle movements, such as eye movements. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method enables the generation of diverse facial expressions for multiple macaque individuals, outperforming models trained solely on original still images. Additionally, we show that our model is effective for style-based image editing, where specific style parameters correspond to distinct facial movements. These findings underscore the model's potential for disentangling motion components as style parameters, providing a valuable tool for research on macaque facial expressions.

Abstract: Personalized dual-person portrait customization has considerable potential applications, such as preserving emotional memories and facilitating wedding photography planning. However, the absence of a benchmark dataset hinders the pursuit of high-quality customization in dual-person portrait generation. In this paper, we propose the PairHuman dataset, which is the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed for generating dual-person portraits that meet high photographic standards. The PairHuman dataset contains more than 100K images that capture a variety of scenes, attire, and dual-person interactions, along with rich metadata, including detailed image descriptions, person localization, human keypoints, and attribute tags. We also introduce DHumanDiff, which is a baseline specifically crafted for dual-person portrait generation that features enhanced facial consistency and simultaneously balances in personalized person generation and semantic-driven scene creation. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that our dataset and method produce highly customized portraits with superior visual quality that are tailored to human preferences.

Motivation: 中子成像在惯性约束聚变(ICF)事件分析中至关重要，但图像常被高斯和泊松噪声共同污染，传统滤波和阈值方法难以有效去除这些重叠噪声，需要开发能保持图像保真度的去噪技术。

Result: 该方法成功去除了中子成像数据中的噪声，与BM3D等非机器学习滤波方法相比，显示出更低的重建误差和更优的边缘保持指标。

Conclusion: 这种基于机器学习的去噪方法为中子图像噪声减少和ICF实验的三维重建分析提供了有前景的进展。

Abstract: Neutron imaging is important in optimizing analysis of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) events such as those at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) and improving current and future ICF platforms. However, images of neutron sources are often degraded by various types of noise. Most commonly, Gaussian and Poisson noise often coexist within one image, obscuring fine details and blurring edges. These noise types often overlap, making them difficult to distinguish and remove using conventional filtering and thresholding methods. As a result, noise removal techniques that preserve image fidelity are important for analyzing and interpreting images of a neutron source. Current solutions include a combination of filtering and thresholding methodologies. In the past, machine learning approaches were rarely implemented due to a lack of ground truth neutron imaging data for ICF processes. However, recent advances in synthetic data production, particularly in the fusion imaging field, have opened opportunities to investigate new denoising procedures using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, we implement an unsupervised autoencoder with a Cohen-Daubechies- Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising. The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data. Additionally, it demonstrates lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics when benchmarked with data generated by a forward model and compared to non-ML-based filtering mechanisms such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D). This approach presents a promising advancement in neutron image noise reduction and three-dimensional reconstruction analysis of ICF experiments.

Conclusion: SAM 3在提示概念分割方面取得了显著进展，开源了模型和新的Segment Anything with Concepts基准测试，为视觉分割任务提供了强大的统一解决方案。

Abstract: We present Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3, a unified model that detects, segments, and tracks objects in images and videos based on concept prompts, which we define as either short noun phrases (e.g., "yellow school bus"), image exemplars, or a combination of both. Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) takes such prompts and returns segmentation masks and unique identities for all matching object instances. To advance PCS, we build a scalable data engine that produces a high-quality dataset with 4M unique concept labels, including hard negatives, across images and videos. Our model consists of an image-level detector and a memory-based video tracker that share a single backbone. Recognition and localization are decoupled with a presence head, which boosts detection accuracy. SAM 3 doubles the accuracy of existing systems in both image and video PCS, and improves previous SAM capabilities on visual segmentation tasks. We open source SAM 3 along with our new Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co) benchmark for promptable concept segmentation.

Motivation: 传统视觉语言模型安全微调方法导致泛化性能显著下降，原因是刚性对齐策略破坏了模型的语义结构。

Method: 采用邻近感知方法，最小化表示变化，将不安全概念重定向到语义上最接近的安全替代方案。

Result: SaFeR-CLIP在保持鲁棒安全性的同时，比先前方法恢复高达8.0%的零样本准确率，并贡献了NSFW-Caps新基准。

Conclusion: 尊重预训练表示的几何结构是实现安全而不牺牲性能的关键。

Abstract: Improving the safety of vision-language models like CLIP via fine-tuning often comes at a steep price, causing significant drops in their generalization performance. We find this trade-off stems from rigid alignment strategies that force unsafe concepts toward single, predefined safe targets, disrupting the model's learned semantic structure. To address this, we propose a proximity-aware approach: redirecting unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives to minimize representational change. We introduce SaFeR-CLIP, a fine-tuning framework that applies this principle of minimal intervention. SaFeR-CLIP successfully reconciles safety and performance, recovering up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. To support more rigorous evaluation, we also contribute NSFW-Caps, a new benchmark of 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for testing safety under distributional shift. Our work shows that respecting the geometry of pretrained representations is key to achieving safety without sacrificing performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单对象SVG的多视图一致生成研究不足，现有方法难以保持几何和颜色的一致性。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 将输入SVG栅格化并提升为3D表示，在目标相机姿态下渲染多视图图像；2) 扩展SAM2的时间记忆机制到空间域，构建空间记忆库建立跨视图的部件级对应关系；3) 在栅格到矢量转换中执行路径整合和结构优化以减少冗余。

Conclusion: 该工作连接了生成建模和结构化矢量表示，为单输入、对象级多视图SVG生成提供了可扩展路径，支持资产创建和语义矢量编辑等应用。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are central to modern design workflows, offering scaling without distortion and precise editability. However, for single object SVGs, generating multi-view consistent SVGs from a single-view input remains underexplored. We present a three stage framework that produces multi-view SVGs with geometric and color consistency from a single SVG input. First, the rasterized input is lifted to a 3D representation and rendered under target camera poses, producing multi-view images of the object. Next, we extend the temporal memory mechanism of Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) to the spatial domain, constructing a spatial memory bank that establishes part level correspondences across neighboring views, yielding cleaner and more consistent vector paths and color assignments without retraining. Finally, during the raster to vector conversion, we perform path consolidation and structural optimization to reduce redundancy while preserving boundaries and semantics. The resulting SVGs exhibit strong geometric and color consistency across views, significantly reduce redundant paths, and retain fine structural details. This work bridges generative modeling and structured vector representation, providing a scalable route to single input, object level multi-view SVG generation and supporting applications such as asset creation and semantic vector editing.

Conclusion: Mesh RAG框架有效解决了自回归网格生成中的质量-速度权衡问题，实现了高效并行推理和增量编辑能力。

Abstract: 3D meshes are a critical building block for applications ranging from industrial design and gaming to simulation and robotics. Traditionally, meshes are crafted manually by artists, a process that is time-intensive and difficult to scale. To automate and accelerate this asset creation, autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for artistic mesh generation. However, current methods to enhance quality typically rely on larger models or longer sequences that result in longer generation time, and their inherent sequential nature imposes a severe quality-speed trade-off. This sequential dependency also significantly complicates incremental editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mesh RAG, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play framework for autoregressive mesh generation models. Inspired by RAG for language models, our approach augments the generation process by leveraging point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components. This retrieval-based approach decouples generation from its strict sequential dependency, facilitating efficient and parallelizable inference. We demonstrate the wide applicability of Mesh RAG across various foundational autoregressive mesh generation models, showing it significantly enhances mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential part prediction, and enables incremental editing, all without model retraining.

Conclusion: REO-Instruct为开发能够同时进行描述和科学推理的新一代地理空间模型提供了标准化基础。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision language models (VLMs) has enabled remarkable perception and reasoning capabilities, yet their potential for scientific regression in Earth Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. Existing EO datasets mainly emphasize semantic understanding tasks such as captioning or classification, lacking benchmarks that align multimodal perception with measurable biophysical variables. To fill this gap, we present REO-Instruct, the first unified benchmark designed for both descriptive and regression tasks in EO. REO-Instruct establishes a cognitively interpretable logic chain in forest ecological scenario (human activity,land-cover classification, ecological patch counting, above-ground biomass (AGB) regression), bridging qualitative understanding and quantitative prediction. The dataset integrates co-registered Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 imagery with structured textual annotations generated and validated through a hybrid human AI pipeline. Comprehensive evaluation protocols and baseline results across generic VLMs reveal that current models struggle with numeric reasoning, highlighting an essential challenge for scientific VLMs. REO-Instruct offers a standardized foundation for developing and assessing next-generation geospatial models capable of both description and scientific inference.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在空间推理基准测试中表现良好，但缺乏对物体交互的细粒度空间理解能力，包括精确3D定位、物体物理兼容性、物体可供性和多步空间规划等真实世界应用所需的关键能力。

Method: 利用Benchmark for Object Pose Estimation (BOP)数据集中的6D物体位姿，开发数据生成流程，获得细粒度标注，包括抓取位姿、参考物体位姿、路径规划轨迹、相对空间和深度关系以及物体间关系。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks, yet these evaluations mask critical weaknesses in understanding object interactions. Current benchmarks test high level relationships ('left of,' 'behind', etc.) but ignore fine-grained spatial understanding needed for real world applications: precise 3D localization, physical compatibility between objects, object affordances and multi step spatial planning. In this work, we present BOP-ASK, a novel large scale dataset for object interaction reasoning for both training and benchmarking. Our data generation pipeline leverages 6D object poses from the Benchmark for Object Pose Estimation (BOP) datasets from which we derive fine grained annotations such as grasp poses, referred object poses, path planning trajectories, relative spatial and depth relationships, and object-to-object relationships. BOP-ASK comprises over 150k images and 33M question answer pairs spanning six tasks (four novel), providing a rich resource for training and evaluating VLMs. We evaluate proprietary and open sourced VLMs, and conduct human evaluations on BOP-ASK-core, a contributed test benchmark. We also release BOP-ASK-lab, an out-of-distribution benchmark with images not sourced from BOP, enabling testing of generalization. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on BOP-ASK outperform baselines and exhibit emergent capabilities such as precise object and grasp pose estimation, trajectory planning, and fine-grained object-centric spatial reasoning in cluttered environments. We will publicly release our datasets and dataset generation pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中捕获的骨架常因遮挡或通信质量差而不完整，现有GCN模型在缺失局部上下文时表现不佳，需要增强对远距离关节上下文信息的捕捉能力。

Method: 提出Parts-Mamba混合模型，结合GCN和Mamba架构，通过部分特定扫描特征捕获部分特定信息，并利用部分-身体融合模块保持非相邻关节的上下文。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D 60和NTU RGB+D 120数据集的不同遮挡设置下评估，准确率最高提升12.9%。

Conclusion: Parts-Mamba模型能有效处理不完整骨架数据，通过增强远距离上下文捕捉能力显著提升骨架动作识别性能。

Abstract: Skeleton action recognition involves recognizing human action from human skeletons. The use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) has driven major advances in this recognition task. In real-world scenarios, the captured skeletons are not always perfect or complete because of occlusions of parts of the human body or poor communication quality, leading to missing parts in skeletons or videos with missing frames. In the presence of such non-idealities, existing GCN models perform poorly due to missing local context. To address this limitation, we propose Parts-Mamba, a hybrid GCN-Mamba model designed to enhance the ability to capture and maintain contextual information from distant joints. The proposed Parts-Mamba model effectively captures part-specific information through its parts-specific scanning feature and preserves non-neighboring joint context via a parts-body fusion module. Our proposed model is evaluated on the NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets under different occlusion settings, achieving up to 12.9% improvement in accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Gromov-Wasserstein距离仅限于单对单的对象匹配，无法满足需要多对一或多对多匹配的应用场景需求。

Method: 通过引入JGW目标，扩展GW框架以支持对象集合的同时匹配，采用最优传输算法（包括熵正则化）进行求解。

Conclusion: JGW方法为计算机图形学和结构生物学等领域的复杂匹配问题提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance serves as a powerful tool for matching objects in metric spaces. However, its traditional formulation is constrained to pairwise matching between single objects, limiting its utility in scenarios and applications requiring multiple-to-one or multiple-to-multiple object matching. In this paper, we introduce the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) objective and extend the original framework of GW to enable simultaneous matching between collections of objects. Our formulation provides a non-negative dissimilarity measure that identifies partially isomorphic distributions of mm-spaces, with point sampling convergence. We also show that the objective can be formulated and solved for point cloud object representations by adapting traditional algorithms in Optimal Transport, including entropic regularization. Our benchmarking with other variants of GW for partial matching indicates superior performance in accuracy and computational efficiency of our method, while experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show its effectiveness for multiple shape matching, including geometric shapes and biomolecular complexes, suggesting promising applications for solving complex matching problems across diverse domains, including computer graphics and structural biology.

Motivation: 利用预训练自监督编码器的表示作为引导，为逆问题求解提供强大的归纳偏置，改善收敛性和样本质量。

Method: 在推理时应用表示对齐（REPA）正则化，将扩散模型或流模型的内部表示与预训练视觉编码器的特征对齐，即使没有真实信号也能通过近似目标特征提升重建效果。

Conclusion: REPA提供了一种通用且高效的逆问题求解框架，通过表示对齐显著改善感知保真度，并为理解该方法如何引导模型内部表示提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Enforcing alignment between the internal representations of diffusion or flow-based generative models and those of pretrained self-supervised encoders has recently been shown to provide a powerful inductive bias, improving both convergence and sample quality. In this work, we extend this idea to inverse problems, where pretrained generative models are employed as priors. We propose applying representation alignment (REPA) between diffusion or flow-based models and a pretrained self-supervised visual encoder, such as DINOv2, to guide the reconstruction process at inference time. Although ground-truth signals are unavailable in inverse problems, we show that aligning model representations with approximate target features can substantially enhance reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. We provide theoretical results showing (a) the relation between the REPA regularization and a divergence measure in the DINOv2 embedding space, and (b) how REPA updates steer the model's internal representations toward those of the clean image. These results offer insights into the role of REPA in improving perceptual fidelity. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art inverse problem solvers. Extensive experiments on super-resolution, box inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring confirm that our method consistently improves reconstruction quality across tasks, while also providing substantial efficiency gains by reducing the number of required discretization steps without compromising the performance of the underlying solver.

Conclusion: 基于闪光/无闪光图像对中的反射动态特性，提出的NFGlassNet方法能够有效检测玻璃表面，为这一具有挑战性的计算机视觉任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Glass surfaces are ubiquitous in daily life, typically appearing colorless, transparent, and lacking distinctive features. These characteristics make glass surface detection a challenging computer vision task. Existing glass surface detection methods always rely on boundary cues (e.g., window and door frames) or reflection cues to locate glass surfaces, but they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic properties of the glass itself for accurate localization. We observed that in most real-world scenes, the illumination intensity in front of the glass surface differs from that behind it, which results in variations in the reflections visible on the glass surface. Specifically, when standing on the brighter side of the glass and applying a flash towards the darker side, existing reflections on the glass surface tend to disappear. Conversely, while standing on the darker side and applying a flash towards the brighter side, distinct reflections will appear on the glass surface. Based on this phenomenon, we propose NFGlassNet, a novel method for glass surface detection that leverages the reflection dynamics present in flash/no-flash imagery. Specifically, we propose a Reflection Contrast Mining Module (RCMM) for extracting reflections, and a Reflection Guided Attention Module (RGAM) for fusing features from reflection and glass surface for accurate glass surface detection. For learning our network, we also construct a dataset consisting of 3.3K no-flash and flash image pairs captured from various scenes with corresponding ground truth annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code, model, and dataset will be available upon acceptance of the manuscript.

Abstract: Recently, rapid advancements have been made in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially in video understanding tasks. However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, R-AVST is the first dataset designed for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero offers a novel perspective for tackling future challenges in this domain.

Conclusion: Warm Diffusion成功整合了热扩散和冷扩散的优势，为图像生成提供了一种有效的统一方法。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks across diverse data types. While recent studies have explored alternative degradation processes beyond Gaussian noise, this paper bridges two key diffusion paradigms: hot diffusion, which relies entirely on noise, and cold diffusion, which uses only blurring without noise. We argue that hot diffusion fails to exploit the strong correlation between high-frequency image detail and low-frequency structures, leading to random behaviors in the early steps of generation. Conversely, while cold diffusion leverages image correlations for prediction, it neglects the role of noise (randomness) in shaping the data manifold, resulting in out-of-manifold issues and partially explaining its performance drop. To integrate both strengths, we propose Warm Diffusion, a unified Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model (BNMD), to control blurring and noise jointly. Our divide-and-conquer strategy exploits the spectral dependency in images, simplifying score model estimation by disentangling the denoising and deblurring processes. We further analyze the Blur-to-Noise Ratio (BNR) using spectral analysis to investigate the trade-off between model learning dynamics and changes in the data manifold. Extensive experiments across benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach for image generation.

Abstract: Quality assessment of AI-generated content is crucial for evaluating model capability and guiding model optimization. However, most existing quality assessment datasets and models provide only a single quality score, which is too coarse to offer targeted guidance for improving generative models. In current applications of AI-generated images, realism and plausibility are two critical dimensions, and with the emergence of unified generation-understanding models, fine-grained evaluation along these dimensions becomes especially effective for improving generative performance. Therefore, we introduce Q-Real, a novel dataset for fine-grained evaluation of realism and plausibility in AI-generated images. Q-Real consists of 3,088 images generated by popular text-to-image models. For each image, we annotate the locations of major entities and provide a set of judgment questions and attribution descriptions for these along the dimensions of realism and plausibility. Considering that recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) enable fine-grained evaluation of AI-generated images, we construct Q-Real Bench to evaluate them on two tasks: judgment and grounding with reasoning. Finally, to enhance MLLM capabilities, we design a fine-tuning framework and conduct experiments on multiple MLLMs using our dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the high quality and significance of our dataset and the comprehensiveness of the benchmark. Dataset and code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: We present UniModel, a unified generative model that jointly supports visual understanding and visual generation within a single pixel-to-pixel diffusion framework. Our goal is to achieve unification along three axes: the model, the tasks, and the representations. At the representation level, we eliminate modality discrepancies by mapping both text and images into a shared visual space: textual prompts are rendered as painted text images on a clean canvas, and all inputs and outputs are treated purely as RGB pixels. This yields a fully vision-native formulation of multimodal learning. At the task level, a broad range of vision-language problems are cast as pixel-to-pixel transformations in this visual space. For understanding tasks, the model takes an RGB image and produces a painted text image that visually encodes the semantic prediction. For generation tasks, painted text images serve as visual conditions that guide realistic and semantically aligned image synthesis. Captioning and text-to-image generation thus become different directions of the same underlying visual translation process. At the model level, we instantiate a single Unified Diffusion Transformer trained with rectified flow in pixel space. A shared backbone jointly learns bidirectional mappings between natural images and painted text images, with lightweight task embeddings to specify the desired direction. Experiments on text-to-image synthesis and image-to-text understanding demonstrate strong cross-modal alignment and emergent controllability such as cycle-consistent image-caption-image loops. Our initial exploration suggests that unifying model, tasks, and representations in a single visual space is a promising paradigm for general-purpose multimodal intelligence.

Conclusion: DeltaDeno提供了一种无需训练和异常样本的零样本异常生成方案，通过扩散模型对比和定位技术有效解决了异常生成中的稀缺性问题。

Abstract: Anomaly generation is often framed as few-shot fine-tuning with anomalous samples, which contradicts the scarcity that motivates generation and tends to overfit category priors. We tackle the setting where no real anomaly samples or training are available. We propose Delta-Denoising (DeltaDeno), a training-free zero-shot anomaly generation method that localizes and edits defects by contrasting two diffusion branches driven by a minimal prompt pair under a shared schedule. By accumulating per-step denoising deltas into an image-specific localization map, we obtain a mask to guide the latent inpainting during later diffusion steps and preserve the surrounding context while generating realistic local defects. To improve stability and control, DeltaDeno performs token-level prompt refinement that aligns shared content and strengthens anomaly tokens, and applies a spatial attention bias restricted to anomaly tokens in the predicted region. Experiments on public datasets show that DeltaDeno achieves great generation, realism and consistent gains in downstream detection performance. Code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 特征域比像素域更适合信息补偿，在放大分辨率下变形能更好保留高频信息，提出的DGAF-VSR方法有效解决了基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率中的关键问题。

Abstract: Diffusion model (DM) based Video Super-Resolution (VSR) approaches achieve impressive perceptual quality. However, they suffer from error accumulation, spatial artifacts, and a trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity, primarily caused by inaccurate alignment and insufficient compensation between video frames. In this paper, within the DM-based VSR pipeline, we revisit the role of alignment and compensation between adjacent video frames and reveal two crucial observations: (a) the feature domain is better suited than the pixel domain for information compensation due to its stronger spatial and temporal correlations, and (b) warping at an upscaled resolution better preserves high-frequency information, but this benefit is not necessarily monotonic. Therefore, we propose a novel Densely Guided diffusion model with Aligned Features for Video Super-Resolution (DGAF-VSR), with an Optical Guided Warping Module (OGWM) to maintain high-frequency details in the aligned features and a Feature-wise Temporal Condition Module (FTCM) to deliver dense guidance in the feature domain. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DGAF-VSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in key aspects of VSR, including perceptual quality (35.82\% DISTS reduction), fidelity (0.20 dB PSNR gain), and temporal consistency (30.37\% tLPIPS reduction).

Abstract: Background:Accurate tooth segmentation from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images is crucial for digital dentistry but remains challenging in cases of interdental adhesions, which cause severe anatomical shape distortion.
  Methods:
  To address this, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates semantic and shape awareness for shape-preserving segmentation. Our method introduces a target-tooth-centroid prompted multi-label learning strategy to model semantic relationships between teeth, reducing shape ambiguity. Additionally, a tooth-shape-aware learning mechanism explicitly enforces morphological constraints to preserve boundary integrity. These components are unified via multi-task learning, jointly optimizing segmentation and shape preservation.
  Results: Extensive evaluations on internal and external datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods.
  Conclusions: Our approach effectively mitigates shape distortions and providing anatomically faithful tooth boundaries.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了OmniGround基准测试和PG-TAF框架来解决视频时空定位中的类别偏见和复杂查询处理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在视频时空定位任务中与现实需求存在差距，主要由于基准测试范围有限导致模型存在类别偏见、推理过于简化和语言鲁棒性差的问题。

Method: 引入OmniGround基准测试（3,475个视频，81个类别），提出前向-后向-精化标注流程，开发DeepSTG评估框架，并提出PG-TAF训练免费的两阶段框架（高层时间定位和细粒度时空传播）。

Result: 在复杂真实场景中性能平均下降10.4%，PG-TAF在OmniGround上m_tIoU和m_vIoU分别提升25.6%和35.6%，在四个基准测试上均取得一致增益。

Conclusion: OmniGround基准测试和PG-TAF框架有效解决了视频时空定位中的现有局限性，显著提升了模型在复杂真实场景下的性能。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize target objects in videos based on natural language descriptions. Despite recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models, a significant gap remains between current models and real-world demands involving diverse objects and complex queries. We attribute this to limited benchmark scope, causing models to exhibit category bias, oversimplified reasoning, and poor linguistic robustness. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniGround, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,475 videos spanning 81 categories and complex real-world queries. We propose the Forward-Backward-Refinement annotation pipeline that combines multi-directional tracking with intelligent error correction for high-quality labels. We further introduce DeepSTG, a systematic evaluation framework quantifying dataset quality across four complementary dimensions beyond superficial statistics. Evaluations reveal performance average drop of 10.4% on complex real-world scenes, particularly with small/occluded objects and intricate spatial relations. Motivated by these, we propose PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework decomposing STVG into high-level temporal grounding and fine-grained spatio-temporal propagation. Experiments demonstrate PG-TAF achieves 25.6% and 35.6% improvements in m\_tIoU and m\_vIoU on OmniGround with consistent gains across four benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MultiPriv基准，用于系统评估视觉语言模型中的个体级隐私推理风险，发现现有模型存在重大隐私推理威胁，且传统安全对齐措施对此类攻击无效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型具备复杂推理能力，带来了超越简单属性感知的个体级隐私链接风险，而现有隐私基准主要评估隐私感知，无法应对更关键的隐私推理风险。

Method: 提出隐私感知与推理（PPR）框架，构建包含合成个体配置文件的双语多模态数据集，设计了9个挑战性任务来评估PPR全谱系，并对50多个基础模型和商业模型进行了大规模评估。

Result: 发现许多VLM存在显著但未被测量的基于推理的隐私风险；感知级指标无法预测这些推理风险；现有安全对齐措施对此类基于推理的攻击不一致且无效。

Conclusion: MultiPriv揭示了系统性漏洞，为开发强大的隐私保护VLM提供了必要框架。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate sophisticated reasoning, escalating privacy risks beyond simple attribute perception to individual-level linkage. Current privacy benchmarks are structurally insufficient for this new threat, as they primarily evaluate privacy perception while failing to address the more critical risk of privacy reasoning: a VLM's ability to infer and link distributed information to construct individual profiles. To address this critical gap, we propose \textbf{MultiPriv}, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate individual-level privacy reasoning in VLMs. We introduce the \textbf{Privacy Perception and Reasoning (PPR)} framework and construct a novel, bilingual multimodal dataset to support it. The dataset uniquely features a core component of synthetic individual profiles where identifiers (e.g., faces, names) are meticulously linked to sensitive attributes. This design enables nine challenging tasks evaluating the full PPR spectrum, from attribute detection to cross-image re-identification and chained inference. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of over 50 foundational and commercial VLMs. Our analysis reveals: (1) Many VLMs possess significant, unmeasured reasoning-based privacy risks. (2) Perception-level metrics are poor predictors of these reasoning risks, revealing a critical evaluation gap. (3) Existing safety alignments are inconsistent and ineffective against such reasoning-based attacks. MultiPriv exposes systemic vulnerabilities and provides the necessary framework for developing robust, privacy-preserving VLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运动补偿重建依赖预估计的光学流，但在欠采样情况下不准确，会降低重建质量。需要一种能同时恢复高质量图像和运动场的方法。

Method: 使用两个隐式神经表示：一个参数化时空图像内容，另一个表示光学流。两者通过光学流方程耦合，结合数据一致性损失进行联合优化。

Result: 在动态心脏MRI数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有运动补偿和深度学习方法，实现了更好的重建质量、准确运动估计和改进的时间保真度。

Conclusion: 隐式联合建模结合流正则化约束在动态MRI重建中具有重要潜力，能够同时获得高质量重建图像和精确运动场。

Abstract: Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) captures temporally-resolved anatomy but is often challenged by limited sampling and motion-induced artifacts. Conventional motion-compensated reconstructions typically rely on pre-estimated optical flow, which is inaccurate under undersampling and degrades reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a novel implicit neural representation (INR) framework that jointly models both the dynamic image sequence and its underlying motion field. Specifically, one INR is employed to parameterize the spatiotemporal image content, while another INR represents the optical flow. The two are coupled via the optical flow equation, which serves as a physics-inspired regularization, in addition to a data consistency loss that enforces agreement with k-space measurements. This joint optimization enables simultaneous recovery of temporally coherent images and motion fields without requiring prior flow estimation. Experiments on dynamic cardiac MRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art motion-compensated and deep learning approaches, achieving superior reconstruction quality, accurate motion estimation, and improved temporal fidelity. These results highlight the potential of implicit joint modeling with flow-regularized constraints for advancing dMRI reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出了FingerCap任务和FiGOP方法，用于生成细粒度手指级手部运动描述，通过结合RGB帧和手部关键点来捕捉高频手指运动细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解细粒度手部运动对视觉感知和智能交互至关重要，但现有视频多模态大模型在稀疏RGB采样下难以捕捉细微的手指动态。

Method: 引入FiGOP方法，将每个RGB关键帧与后续手部关键点配对，通过轻量级时序编码器将关键点转换为运动嵌入并与RGB特征融合。

Result: 在FingerCap-40K数据集上的实验表明，现有Video-MLLMs在手指级推理上仍有困难，而FiGOP增强模型在HandJudge评估和人工研究中均取得一致提升。

Conclusion: FiGOP通过恢复精细时序线索而不增加RGB密度，有效解决了手指运动捕捉的时序稀疏性问题。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained human hand motion is fundamental to visual perception, embodied intelligence, and multimodal communication. In this work, we propose Fine-grained Finger-level Hand Motion Captioning (FingerCap), which aims to generate textual descriptions that capture detailed finger-level semantics of hand actions. To support this task, we curate FingerCap-40K, a large-scale corpus of 40K paired hand-motion videos and captions spanning two complementary sources: concise instruction-style finger motions and diverse, naturalistic hand-object interactions. To enable effective evaluation, we employ HandJudge, a LLM-based rubric that measures finger-level correctness and motion completeness. Temporal sparsity remains a fundamental bottleneck for current Video-MLLMs, since sparse RGB sampling is insufficient to capture the subtle, high-frequency dynamics underlying fine finger motions. As a simple and compute-friendly remedy, we introduce FiGOP (Finger Group-of-Pictures), which pairs each RGB keyframe with subsequent hand keypoints until the next keyframe. A lightweight temporal encoder converts the keypoints into motion embeddings and integrates them with RGB features. FiGOP adapts the classic GOP concept to finger motion, recovering fine temporal cues without increasing RGB density. Experiments on FingerCap-40K show that strong open- and closed-source Video-MLLMs still struggle with finger-level reasoning, while our FiGOP-augmented model yield consistent gains under HandJudge and human studies.

Method: 提出双分支框架：1) 类无关表情强度分支，使用高斯实例自适应强度建模模块生成软伪标签；2) 类感知顶点分类分支，基于伪顶点帧区分宏表情和微表情。还引入了强度感知对比损失来增强特征学习。

Result: 在SAMM-LV、CAS(ME)^2和CAS(ME)^3数据集上的广泛实验证明了所提框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的点监督面部表情定位框架能够以更低的标注成本实现准确的表情定位和分类，为面部表情分析提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic facial expression spotting, which aims to identify facial expression instances in untrimmed videos, is crucial for facial expression analysis. Existing methods primarily focus on fully-supervised learning and rely on costly, time-consuming temporal boundary annotations. In this paper, we investigate point-supervised facial expression spotting (P-FES), where only a single timestamp annotation per instance is required for training. We propose a unique two-branch framework for P-FES. First, to mitigate the limitation of hard pseudo-labeling, which often confuses neutral and expression frames with various intensities, we propose a Gaussian-based instance-adaptive intensity modeling (GIM) module to model instance-level expression intensity distribution for soft pseudo-labeling. By detecting the pseudo-apex frame around each point label, estimating the duration, and constructing an instance-level Gaussian distribution, GIM assigns soft pseudo-labels to expression frames for more reliable intensity supervision. The GIM module is incorporated into our framework to optimize the class-agnostic expression intensity branch. Second, we design a class-aware apex classification branch that distinguishes macro- and micro-expressions solely based on their pseudo-apex frames. During inference, the two branches work independently: the class-agnostic expression intensity branch generates expression proposals, while the class-aware apex-classification branch is responsible for macro- and micro-expression classification.Furthermore, we introduce an intensity-aware contrastive loss to enhance discriminative feature learning and suppress neutral noise by contrasting neutral frames with expression frames with various intensities. Extensive experiments on the SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)$^2$, and CAS(ME)$^3$ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

TL;DR: 提出了Neighbor GRPO方法，通过扰动ODE初始噪声条件生成多样化轨迹，使用基于softmax距离的代理策略进行优化，完全绕过了SDE转换，解决了SDE-based GRPO的信用分配效率低和与高阶求解器不兼容的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SDE-based GRPO方法在应用于流匹配模型时存在信用分配效率低和与高阶求解器不兼容的问题，需要一种能保持确定性ODE采样优势的新方法。

Method: 从距离优化角度重新解释SDE-based GRPO，提出Neighbor GRPO：通过扰动ODE初始噪声生成候选轨迹，使用softmax距离代理策略优化模型，引入对称锚点采样和组内准范数重加权。

Result: 实验表明Neighbor GRPO在训练成本、收敛速度和生成质量方面显著优于SDE-based方法。

Conclusion: Neighbor GRPO成功解决了SDE-based GRPO的局限性，完全保留了确定性ODE采样的效率优势，并与高阶求解器兼容。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promise in aligning image and video generative models with human preferences. However, applying it to modern flow matching models is challenging because of its deterministic sampling paradigm. Current methods address this issue by converting Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), which introduce stochasticity. However, this SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling. In this paper, we first reinterpret existing SDE-based GRPO methods from a distance optimization perspective, revealing their underlying mechanism as a form of contrastive learning. Based on this insight, we propose Neighbor GRPO, a novel alignment algorithm that completely bypasses the need for SDEs. Neighbor GRPO generates a diverse set of candidate trajectories by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy. We establish a theoretical connection between this distance-based objective and policy gradient optimization, rigorously integrating our approach into the GRPO framework. Our method fully preserves the advantages of deterministic ODE sampling, including efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers. We further introduce symmetric anchor sampling for computational efficiency and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting to address reward flattening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neighbor GRPO significantly outperforms SDE-based counterparts in terms of training cost, convergence speed, and generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的材质生成方法缺乏统一的表示来桥接自然图像外观和PBR属性，导致任务特定的碎片化流程，无法利用大规模RGB图像数据。

Method: 提出联合RGB-PBR表示，将材质编码为RGB外观和四个PBR贴图的5帧序列，使用视频扩散架构捕捉相关性并转移RGB生成模型的视觉先验。

Result: 在MatHybrid-410K数据集上训练，实现了原生1024×1024合成，在质量和多样性上显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: MatPedia提供了一个统一的框架，能够处理文本到材质生成、图像到材质生成和内在分解等多种材质任务。

Abstract: Physically-based rendering (PBR) materials are fundamental to photorealistic graphics, yet their creation remains labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise. While generative models have advanced material synthesis, existing methods lack a unified representation bridging natural image appearance and PBR properties, leading to fragmented task-specific pipelines and inability to leverage large-scale RGB image data. We present MatPedia, a foundation model built upon a novel joint RGB-PBR representation that compactly encodes materials into two interdependent latents: one for RGB appearance and one for the four PBR maps encoding complementary physical properties. By formulating them as a 5-frame sequence and employing video diffusion architectures, MatPedia naturally captures their correlations while transferring visual priors from RGB generation models. This joint representation enables a unified framework handling multiple material tasks--text-to-material generation, image-to-material generation, and intrinsic decomposition--within a single architecture. Trained on MatHybrid-410K, a mixed corpus combining PBR datasets with large-scale RGB images, MatPedia achieves native $1024\times1024$ synthesis that substantially surpasses existing approaches in both quality and diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在已知固定退化（如双三次下采样）的SISR任务中表现优异，但当实际退化偏离这些假设时性能会显著下降。需要解决盲SR问题，即处理未知和变化的退化类型。

Method: 提出双分支退化提取器网络，预测两个无监督退化嵌入（模糊和噪声信息），让超分网络以不同方式适应这些嵌入，并将退化提取器作为正则化器利用SR与HR图像的差异。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在盲SR问题上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的双分支退化提取网络能有效处理盲超分问题，通过分别建模模糊和噪声退化，实现了在未知退化情况下的鲁棒超分性能。

Abstract: Previous methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in single image super-resolution (SISR) tasks with known and fixed degradation (e.g., bicubic downsampling). However, when the actual degradation deviates from these assumptions, these methods may experience significant declines in performance. In this paper, we propose a Dual Branch Degradation Extractor Network to address the blind SR problem. While some blind SR methods assume noise-free degradation and others do not explicitly consider the presence of noise in the degradation model, our approach predicts two unsupervised degradation embeddings that represent blurry and noisy information. The SR network can then be adapted to blur embedding and noise embedding in distinct ways. Furthermore, we treat the degradation extractor as a regularizer to capitalize on differences between SR and HR images. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves SOTA performance in the blind SR problem.

Conclusion: 该方法能够根据用户偏好的视觉目标而非固定预设生成逼真的熟食图像，实现了边缘设备上的高效食物图像合成。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic cooked food images from raw inputs on edge devices is a challenging generative task, requiring models to capture complex changes in texture, color and structure during cooking. Existing image-to-image generation methods often produce unrealistic results or are too resource-intensive for edge deployment. We introduce the first oven-based cooking-progression dataset with chef-annotated doneness levels and propose an edge-efficient recipe and cooking state guided generator that synthesizes realistic food images conditioned on raw food image. This formulation enables user-preferred visual targets rather than fixed presets. To ensure temporal consistency and culinary plausibility, we introduce a domain-specific \textit{Culinary Image Similarity (CIS)} metric, which serves both as a training loss and a progress-monitoring signal. Our model outperforms existing baselines with significant reductions in FID scores (30\% improvement on our dataset; 60\% on public datasets)

Motivation: 现有方法在处理域偏移和未知类别时面临已知类结构风险与未知类开放空间风险之间的权衡困境，容易产生过度自信，特别是在区分与已知类具有细粒度视觉相似性的“硬未知”类别时表现不佳。

Method: 提出语义增强的CLIP框架，包括语义感知提示增强模块分解图像为判别性语义标记，双工对比学习保持与已知类的分离性和语义邻近性，以及语义引导扩散模块通过扰动语义标记合成伪未知样本。

Conclusion: SeeCLIP通过细粒度语义增强有效解决了开放集域泛化中的关键挑战，在保持已知类性能的同时显著提升了对未知类的识别能力。

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) tackles the realistic scenario where deployed models encounter both domain shifts and novel object categories. Despite impressive progress with vision-language models like CLIP, existing methods still fall into the dilemma between structural risk of known-classes and open-space risk from unknown-classes, and easily suffers from over-confidence, especially when distinguishing ``hard unknowns" that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes. To this end, we propose a Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) framework that explicitly addresses this dilemma through fine-grained semantic enhancement. In SeeCLIP, we propose a semantic-aware prompt enhancement module to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, enabling nuanced vision-language alignment beyond coarse category labels. To position unknown prompts effectively, we introduce duplex contrastive learning with complementary objectives, that is, repulsion to maintain separability from known classes, and cohesion to preserve semantic proximity. Further, our semantic-guided diffusion module synthesizes pseudo-unknowns by perturbing extracted semantic tokens, generating challenging samples that are visually similar to known classes yet exhibit key local differences. These hard negatives force the model to learn finer decision boundaries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements of 3% accuracy and 5% H-score over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法完全可学习且无需人工干预，通过优化梯度驱动的自主选择机制有效解决了3DGS的存储和计算开销问题。

Abstract: 3DGS employs a large number of Gaussian primitives to fit scenes, resulting in substantial storage and computational overhead. Existing pruning methods rely on manually designed criteria or introduce additional learnable parameters, yielding suboptimal results. To address this, we propose an natural selection inspired pruning framework that models survival pressure as a regularization gradient field applied to opacity, allowing the optimization gradients--driven by the goal of maximizing rendering quality--to autonomously determine which Gaussians to retain or prune. This process is fully learnable and requires no human intervention. We further introduce an opacity decay technique with a finite opacity prior, which accelerates the selection process without compromising pruning effectiveness. Compared to 3DGS, our method achieves over 0.6 dB PSNR gain under 15\% budgets, establishing state-of-the-art performance for compact 3DGS. Project page https://xiaobin2001.github.io/GNS-web.

Abstract: Plant diseases pose a significant threat to global agriculture, causing over $220 billion in annual economic losses and jeopardizing food security. The timely and accurate detection of these diseases from plant leaf images is critical to mitigating their adverse effects. Deep neural network Ensembles (Deep Ensembles) have emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of diverse Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, selecting high-performing ensemble member models is challenging due to the inherent difficulty in measuring ensemble diversity. In this paper, we introduce the Synergistic Diversity (SQ) framework to enhance plant disease detection accuracy. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of existing ensemble diversity metrics (denoted as Q metrics), which often fail to identify optimal ensemble teams. Second, we present the SQ metric, a novel measure that captures the synergy between ensemble members and consistently aligns with ensemble accuracy. Third, we validate our SQ approach through extensive experiments on a plant leaf image dataset, which demonstrates that our SQ metric substantially improves ensemble selection and enhances detection accuracy. Our findings pave the way for a more reliable and efficient image-based plant disease detection.

Abstract: Radiomap serves as a vital tool for wireless network management and deployment by providing powerful spatial knowledge of signal propagation and coverage. However, increasingly complex radio propagation behavior and surrounding environments pose strong challenges for radiomap estimation (RME). In this work, we propose a knowledge-guided RME framework that integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), namely RadioKMoE. Specifically, we design a KAN module to predict an initial coarse coverage map, leveraging KAN's strength in approximating physics models and global radio propagation patterns. The initial coarse map, together with environmental information, drives our MoE network for precise radiomap estimation. Unlike conventional deep learning models, the MoE module comprises expert networks specializing in distinct radiomap patterns to improve local details while preserving global consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DReX是一种仅使用视觉信息的模型，通过融合自监督和卷积表示来预测图像复杂度，在IC9600基准测试中达到最先进性能，超越了包括多模态方法在内的先前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉复杂度预测是计算机视觉中的基础问题，现有方法多使用多模态模型结合视觉和语言信息，但语言信息是否必要尚不明确。本文旨在探索仅使用视觉特征是否足以进行人类对齐的复杂度预测。

Method: 提出DReX模型，通过可学习的注意力机制融合ResNet-50的多尺度层次特征和DINOv3 ViT-S/16的语义丰富表示，捕捉低层次纹理模式和高层次语义结构。

Result: 在IC9600基准测试中达到Pearson r = 0.9581的最先进性能，超越先前方法（包括多模态方法），同时使用约21.5倍更少的可学习参数。在多个数据集和指标上均表现优异。

Conclusion: 视觉特征本身足以进行人类对齐的复杂度预测，当适当融合时，自监督transformer和监督深度卷积神经网络为此任务提供互补和协同优势。

Abstract: Visual complexity prediction is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in image compression, retrieval, and classification. Understanding what makes humans perceive an image as complex is also a long-standing question in cognitive science. Recent approaches have leveraged multimodal models that combine visual and linguistic representations, but it remains unclear whether language information is necessary for this task. We propose DReX (DINO-ResNet Fusion), a vision-only model that fuses self-supervised and convolutional representations through a learnable attention mechanism to predict image complexity. Our architecture integrates multi-scale hierarchical features from ResNet-50 with semantically rich representations from DINOv3 ViT-S/16, enabling the model to capture both low-level texture patterns and high-level semantic structure. DReX achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IC9600 benchmark (Pearson r = 0.9581), surpassing previous methods--including those trained on multimodal image-text data--while using approximately 21.5x fewer learnable parameters. Furthermore, DReX generalizes robustly across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving superior results on Pearson and Spearman correlation, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Ablation and attention analyses confirm that DReX leverages complementary cues from both backbones, with the DINOv3 [CLS] token enhancing sensitivity to visual complexity. Our findings suggest that visual features alone can be sufficient for human-aligned complexity prediction and that, when properly fused, self-supervised transformers and supervised deep convolutional neural networks offer complementary and synergistic benefits for this task.

*Junhong Min,Jimin Kim,Cheol-Hui Min,Minwook Kim,Youngpil Jeon,Minyong Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthFocus是一种可操控的视觉Transformer，将立体深度估计重新定义为意图驱动的控制，能够根据深度偏好动态调整计算以聚焦到指定深度层，实现复杂场景中的选择性感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的深度很少是单一的，透射材料会产生层叠的模糊性，而现有模型只能被动估计最近表面的静态深度图，无法像人类那样主动调整焦点来感知所需深度。

Method: 提出DepthFocus，一种基于标量深度偏好进行条件控制的视觉Transformer，主要使用新构建的50万张多层合成数据集进行训练，该数据集专门设计用于捕捉多样化的透视效果。

Result: 在BOOSTER等传统单深度基准测试中达到最先进性能，在新提出的真实和合成多深度数据集上定量展示了意图对齐的估计能力，并在未见过的透视场景中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DepthFocus代表了向主动、类人3D感知迈出的重要一步，展示了其在复杂场景中实现选择性深度感知的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Depth in the real world is rarely singular. Transmissive materials create layered ambiguities that confound conventional perception systems. Existing models remain passive, attempting to estimate static depth maps anchored to the nearest surface, while humans actively shift focus to perceive a desired depth. We introduce DepthFocus, a steerable Vision Transformer that redefines stereo depth estimation as intent-driven control. Conditioned on a scalar depth preference, the model dynamically adapts its computation to focus on the intended depth, enabling selective perception within complex scenes. The training primarily leverages our newly constructed 500k multi-layered synthetic dataset, designed to capture diverse see-through effects. DepthFocus not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on conventional single-depth benchmarks like BOOSTER, a dataset notably rich in transparent and reflective objects, but also quantitatively demonstrates intent-aligned estimation on our newly proposed real and synthetic multi-depth datasets. Moreover, it exhibits strong generalization capabilities on unseen see-through scenes, underscoring its robustness as a significant step toward active and human-like 3D perception.

TL;DR: 提出MVLR模型，通过结合视觉语言模型和隐式记忆库，统一恢复不同天气条件下的退化图像，在保持计算效率的同时提升恢复精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在恶劣天气条件下实现可靠的视觉感知对于自动驾驶和户外机器人至关重要但具有挑战性。

Method: 使用轻量级编码器-解码器主干网络，结合视觉语言模型进行链式推理编码天气退化先验，并通过隐式记忆库存储退化模式表示，通过动态交叉注意力机制自适应融合多尺度视觉特征。

Result: 在四个恶劣天气基准测试中，MVLR在PSNR和SSIM指标上超越了单分支和混合专家基线方法。

Conclusion: MVLR在模型紧凑性和表达能力之间提供了实用平衡，适合在多样化户外条件下进行实时部署。

Abstract: Reliable visual perception under adverse weather conditions, such as rain, haze, snow, or a mixture of them, is desirable yet challenging for autonomous driving and outdoor robots. In this paper, we propose a unified Memory-Enhanced Visual-Language Recovery (MVLR) model that restores images from different degradation levels under various weather conditions. MVLR couples a lightweight encoder-decoder backbone with a Visual-Language Model (VLM) and an Implicit Memory Bank (IMB). The VLM performs chain-of-thought inference to encode weather degradation priors and the IMB stores continuous latent representations of degradation patterns. The VLM-generated priors query the IMB to retrieve fine-grained degradation prototypes. These prototypes are then adaptively fused with multi-scale visual features via dynamic cross-attention mechanisms, enhancing restoration accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on four severe-weather benchmarks show that MVLR surpasses single-branch and Mixture-of-Experts baselines in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These results indicate that MVLR offers a practical balance between model compactness and expressiveness for real-time deployment in diverse outdoor conditions.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ConfusedTourist，一个评估视觉语言模型在混合文化线索下稳定性的对抗性测试套件，发现即使最先进的模型在简单图像堆叠扰动下准确率也会大幅下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估通常只关注单一文化概念，忽略了多个文化线索共存的情况，而模型在这种混合文化输入下的稳定性对于支持多元文化社会至关重要。

Method: 开发了ConfusedTourist测试套件，通过图像堆叠和基于图像生成的扰动来评估VLMs对地理文化线索的稳定性，并进行可解释性分析。

Result: 实验显示VLMs在简单图像堆叠扰动下准确率大幅下降，基于图像生成的扰动效果更差，失败源于注意力系统性地转向分散线索。

Conclusion: 视觉文化概念混合会严重损害最先进VLMs的性能，迫切需要开发更具文化鲁棒性的多模态理解模型。

Abstract: Although the cultural dimension has been one of the key aspects in evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their ability to remain stable across diverse cultural inputs remains largely untested, despite being crucial to support diversity and multicultural societies. Existing evaluations often rely on benchmarks featuring only a singular cultural concept per image, overlooking scenarios where multiple, potentially unrelated cultural cues coexist. To address this gap, we introduce ConfusedTourist, a novel cultural adversarial robustness suite designed to assess VLMs' stability against perturbed geographical cues. Our experiments reveal a critical vulnerability, where accuracy drops heavily under simple image-stacking perturbations and even worsens with its image-generation-based variant. Interpretability analyses further show that these failures stem from systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues, diverting the model from its intended focus. These findings highlight a critical challenge: visual cultural concept mixing can substantially impair even state-of-the-art VLMs, underscoring the urgent need for more culturally robust multimodal understanding.

Motivation: 现有的人脸去标识化方法在身份抑制和属性保留之间难以达到良好平衡，需要一种更有效的方法来保护隐私同时保持图像质量。

Method: 通过优化发现身份编辑方向，使用新颖的试剂损失函数监督属性保留和身份抑制，提出线性和测地线（基于切空间）两种编辑方案来导航潜在流形。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ和FFHQ数据集上的实验表明，FLUID在身份抑制和属性保留之间达到了优越的平衡，在定性和定量指标上都优于最先进的去标识化方法。

Conclusion: FLUID框架通过潜在空间中的身份替换，实现了高效的人脸去标识化，在隐私保护和图像质量之间取得了显著改进。

Abstract: We present FLUID (Face de-identification in the Latent space via Utility-preserving Identity Displacement), a training-free framework that directly substitutes identity in the latent space of pretrained diffusion models. Inspired by substitution mechanisms in chemistry, we reinterpret identity editing as semantic displacement in the latent h-space of a pretrained unconditional diffusion model. Our framework discovers identity-editing directions through optimization guided by novel reagent losses, which supervise for attribute preservation and identity suppression. We further propose both linear and geodesic (tangent-based) editing schemes to effectively navigate the latent manifold. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ demonstrate that FLUID achieves a superior trade-off between identity suppression and attribute preservation, outperforming state-of-the-art de-identification methods in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定性和定量评估中都优于现有技术，实现了具有逼真散焦效果的高保真合成。

Conclusion: 该方法为现实应用提供了灵活实用的解决方案，能够实现高质量的混合现实合成效果。

Abstract: Consistent and natural camera lens blur is important for seamlessly blending 3D virtual objects into photographed real-scenes. Since lens blur typically varies with scene depth, the placement of virtual objects and their corresponding blur levels significantly affect the visual fidelity of mixed reality compositions. Existing pipelines often rely on camera parameters (e.g., focal length, focus distance, aperture size) and scene depth to compute the circle of confusion (CoC) for realistic lens blur rendering. However, such information is often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting the accessibility and generalizability of these methods. In this work, we propose a novel compositing approach that directly estimates the CoC map from RGB images, bypassing the need for scene depth or camera metadata. The CoC values for virtual objects are inferred through a linear relationship between its signed CoC map and depth, and realistic lens blur is rendered using a neural reblurring network. Our method provides flexible and practical solution for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity compositing with realistic defocus effects, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: We introduce RacketVision, a novel dataset and benchmark for advancing computer vision in sports analytics, covering table tennis, tennis, and badminton. The dataset is the first to provide large-scale, fine-grained annotations for racket pose alongside traditional ball positions, enabling research into complex human-object interactions. It is designed to tackle three interconnected tasks: fine-grained ball tracking, articulated racket pose estimation, and predictive ball trajectory forecasting. Our evaluation of established baselines reveals a critical insight for multi-modal fusion: while naively concatenating racket pose features degrades performance, a CrossAttention mechanism is essential to unlock their value, leading to trajectory prediction results that surpass strong unimodal baselines. RacketVision provides a versatile resource and a strong starting point for future research in dynamic object tracking, conditional motion forecasting, and multimodal analysis in sports.

Motivation: 解决传统3D室内场景生成需要手动布局设计或全景图像指导的痛点，实现仅通过短文本输入就能自动生成几何合理的3D室内场景。

Method: 使用分层语言驱动代理规划器解析模糊提示为详细场景描述，通过两个排列约束迭代优化空间布局，采用AnyReach采样策略和ITFS策略优化3D高斯场景表示。

Conclusion: RoomPlanner是第一个全自动3D房间生成框架，证明了仅通过短文本输入就能高效生成高质量3D室内场景的可行性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose RoomPlanner, the first fully automatic 3D room generation framework for painlessly creating realistic indoor scenes with only short text as input. Without any manual layout design or panoramic image guidance, our framework can generate explicit layout criteria for rational spatial placement. We begin by introducing a hierarchical structure of language-driven agent planners that can automatically parse short and ambiguous prompts into detailed scene descriptions. These descriptions include raw spatial and semantic attributes for each object and the background, which are then used to initialize 3D point clouds. To position objects within bounded environments, we implement two arrangement constraints that iteratively optimize spatial arrangements, ensuring a collision-free and accessible layout solution. In the final rendering stage, we propose a novel AnyReach Sampling strategy for camera trajectory, along with the Interval Timestep Flow Sampling (ITFS) strategy, to efficiently optimize the coarse 3D Gaussian scene representation. These approaches help reduce the total generation time to under 30 minutes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can produce geometrically rational 3D indoor scenes, surpassing prior approaches in both rendering speed and visual quality while preserving editability. The code will be available soon.

Motivation: 现有计算流程缺乏明确的推理轨迹，导致预测不透明且不可解释，无法模拟病理学家动态缩放、重新聚焦和自我纠正的证据收集过程。

Method: 使用三个模块：导航器迭代精确定位重要微区域，感知器提取形态学视觉线索，执行器将这些发现整合到持续演变的自然语言轨迹中，形成明确的思维链。

Result: 在五个具有挑战性的数据集上评估，PathAgent展现出强大的零样本泛化能力，在开放性和受限视觉问答任务中均超越特定任务基线。

Conclusion: PathAgent作为透明且基于临床的诊断助手具有前景，与人类病理学家的协作评估证实了其价值。

Abstract: Analyzing whole-slide images (WSIs) requires an iterative, evidence-driven reasoning process that parallels how pathologists dynamically zoom, refocus, and self-correct while collecting the evidence. However, existing computational pipelines often lack this explicit reasoning trajectory, resulting in inherently opaque and unjustifiable predictions. To bridge this gap, we present PathAgent, a training-free, large language model (LLM)-based agent framework that emulates the reflective, stepwise analytical approach of human experts. PathAgent can autonomously explore WSI, iteratively and precisely locating significant micro-regions using the Navigator module, extracting morphology visual cues using the Perceptor, and integrating these findings into the continuously evolving natural language trajectories in the Executor. The entire sequence of observations and decisions forms an explicit chain-of-thought, yielding fully interpretable predictions. Evaluated across five challenging datasets, PathAgent exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing task-specific baselines in both open-ended and constrained visual question-answering tasks. Moreover, a collaborative evaluation with human pathologists confirms PathAgent's promise as a transparent and clinically grounded diagnostic assistant.

Motivation: LVLM在图像级任务表现出色，但在实例级任务如视觉定位和目标检测中仍存在性能差距。行人跟踪任务需要高级语义理解，这正是LVLM的优势所在。

Method: 采用RL-中间训练-SFT-RL的训练阶段：首先通过RL使模型输出固定格式的边界框；然后使用大量行人相关数据集进行中间训练；最后在多个行人跟踪数据集上进行监督微调，再进行RL以提升跟踪性能和指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: OmniPT框架成功地将行人跟踪任务建模为基础模型可执行的任务，并实现了优于现有方法的性能，展示了LVLM在实例级跟踪任务中的潜力。

Abstract: LVLMs have been shown to perform excellently in image-level tasks such as VQA and caption. However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点云补全模型虽然能生成全局合理的形状，但常常存在局部几何不一致的问题，需要一种轻量级、模块化的方法来改进局部几何保真度。

Method: 使用强化学习在预训练点自编码器的潜在空间中调整全局特征向量，结合轻量级PointNN选择器评估几何一致性，保留更好的重建结果。

Result: 在ShapeNetCore-2048上的实验表明，RL-AD-Net在随机裁剪场景下显著优于基线方法，在两种设置下都能提供一致的改进。

Conclusion: RL-AD-Net是一个轻量级、模块化且模型无关的框架，能够有效改进各种补全网络的局部几何一致性，无需重新训练。

Abstract: Recent point cloud completion models, including transformer-based, denoising-based, and other state-of-the-art approaches, generate globally plausible shapes from partial inputs but often leave local geometric inconsistencies. We propose RL-AD-Net, a reinforcement learning (RL) refinement framework that operates in the latent space of a pretrained point autoencoder. The autoencoder encodes completions into compact global feature vectors (GFVs), which are selectively adjusted by an RL agent to improve geometric fidelity. To ensure robustness, a lightweight non-parametric PointNN selector evaluates the geometric consistency of both the original completion and the RL-refined output, retaining the better reconstruction. When ground truth is available, both Chamfer Distance and geometric consistency metrics guide refinement. Training is performed separately per category, since the unsupervised and dynamic nature of RL makes convergence across highly diverse categories challenging. Nevertheless, the framework can be extended to multi-category refinement in future work. Experiments on ShapeNetCore-2048 demonstrate that while baseline completion networks perform reasonable under their training-style cropping, they struggle in random cropping scenarios. In contrast, RL-AD-Net consistently delivers improvements across both settings, highlighting the effectiveness of RL-guided ensemble refinement. The approach is lightweight, modular, and model-agnostic, making it applicable to a wide range of completion networks without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: REArtGS++通过引入时间几何约束和平面高斯溅射，显著提升了铰接物体重建的泛化能力和准确性，特别是在复杂关节类型和多部件场景下。

Abstract: Articulated objects are pervasive in daily environments, such as drawers and refrigerators. Towards their part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, REArtGS~\cite{wu2025reartgs} introduces a category-agnostic approach using multi-view RGB images at two different states. However, we observe that REArtGS still struggles with screw-joint or multi-part objects and lacks geometric constraints for unseen states. In this paper, we propose REArtGS++, a novel method towards generalizable articulated object reconstruction with temporal geometry constraint and planar Gaussian splatting. We first model a decoupled screw motion for each joint without type prior, and jointly optimize part-aware Gaussians with joint parameters through part motion blending. To introduce time-continuous geometric constraint for articulated modeling, we encourage Gaussians to be planar and propose a temporally consistent regularization between planar normal and depth through Taylor first-order expansion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world articulated objects demonstrate our superiority in generalizable part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: ReBrain框架能够有效解决稀疏CT扫描重建完整脑部MRI的挑战，在跨模态重建任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in brain disease diagnosis, but it is not always feasible for certain patients due to physical or clinical constraints. Recent studies attempt to synthesize MRI from Computed Tomography (CT) scans; however, low-dose protocols often result in highly sparse CT volumes with poor through-plane resolution, making accurate reconstruction of the full brain MRI volume particularly challenging. To address this, we propose ReBrain, a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for brain MRI reconstruction. Given any 3D CT scan with limited slices, we first employ a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to synthesize MRI slices along the 2D dimension. Simultaneously, we retrieve structurally and pathologically similar CT slices from a comprehensive prior database via a fine-tuned retrieval model. These retrieved slices are used as references, incorporated through a ControlNet branch to guide the generation of intermediate MRI slices and ensure structural continuity. We further account for rare retrieval failures when the database lacks suitable references and apply spherical linear interpolation to provide supplementary guidance. Extensive experiments on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS demonstrate that ReBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal reconstruction under sparse conditions.

Motivation: VAR模型虽然推理效率高且图像质量好，但存在多样性崩溃问题，类似于少步蒸馏扩散模型中的多样性减少现象。

Method: 通过分析发现特征图中的关键组件是早期尺度多样性形成的关键因素，在模型输入中抑制该组件，在输出中放大该组件。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法显著增强了生成多样性，且对性能影响可忽略不计。

Conclusion: DiverseVAR有效解锁了VAR模型的固有生成潜力，同时保持高保真合成。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have recently garnered significant attention for their innovative next-scale prediction paradigm, offering notable advantages in both inference efficiency and image quality compared to traditional multi-step autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. However, despite their efficiency, VAR models often suffer from the diversity collapse i.e., a reduction in output variability, analogous to that observed in few-step distilled diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce DiverseVAR, a simple yet effective approach that restores the generative diversity of VAR models without requiring any additional training. Our analysis reveals the pivotal component of the feature map as a key factor governing diversity formation at early scales. By suppressing the pivotal component in the model input and amplifying it in the model output, DiverseVAR effectively unlocks the inherent generative potential of VAR models while preserving high-fidelity synthesis. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances generative diversity with only neglectable performance influences. Our code will be publicly released at https://github.com/wangtong627/DiverseVAR.

Method: 利用图像块位置定义的网格中采样的均匀生成树遍历顺序，通过广度优先搜索高效构建生成树，确保连接的部分观测在序列中作为前缀出现。

Result: STAR在保持采样性能的同时，提供了灵活的序列顺序选择，支持后补完成功能，无需对广泛采用的语言AR模型架构进行重大更改。

Conclusion: STAR通过结构化的随机策略成功平衡了采样性能和序列顺序灵活性，为图像编辑应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Spanning Tree Autoregressive (STAR) modeling, which can incorporate prior knowledge of images, such as center bias and locality, to maintain sampling performance while also providing sufficiently flexible sequence orders to accommodate image editing at inference. Approaches that expose randomly permuted sequence orders to conventional autoregressive (AR) models in visual generation for bidirectional context either suffer from a decline in performance or compromise the flexibility in sequence order choice at inference. Instead, STAR utilizes traversal orders of uniform spanning trees sampled in a lattice defined by the positions of image patches. Traversal orders are obtained through breadth-first search, allowing us to efficiently construct a spanning tree whose traversal order ensures that the connected partial observation of the image appears as a prefix in the sequence through rejection sampling. Through the tailored yet structured randomized strategy compared to random permutation, STAR preserves the capability of postfix completion while maintaining sampling performance without any significant changes to the model architecture widely adopted in the language AR modeling.

Abstract: Articulated objects are ubiquitous in daily environments, and their 3D reconstruction holds great significance across various fields. However, existing articulated object reconstruction methods typically require costly inputs such as multi-stage and multi-view observations. To address the limitations, we propose a category-agnostic articulated object reconstruction framework via planar Gaussian Splatting, which only uses sparse-view RGB images from a single state. Specifically, we first introduce a Gaussian information field to perceive the optimal sparse viewpoints from candidate camera poses. Then we compress 3D Gaussians into planar Gaussians to facilitate accurate estimation of normal and depth. The planar Gaussians are optimized in a coarse-to-fine manner through depth smooth regularization and few-shot diffusion. Moreover, we introduce a part segmentation probability for each Gaussian primitive and update them by back-projecting part segmentation masks of renderings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher-fidelity part-level surface reconstruction on both synthetic and real-world data than existing methods. Codes will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a vital role in real-world applications such as security surveillance, autonomous driving, and industrial monitoring. Recent advances in large pre-trained models have opened new opportunities for training-free VAD by leveraging rich prior knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. However, existing studies typically rely on dense frame-level inference, incurring high computational costs and latency. This raises a fundamental question: Is dense reasoning truly necessary when using powerful pre-trained models in VAD systems? To answer this, we propose ReCoVAD, a novel framework inspired by the dual reflex and conscious pathways of the human nervous system, enabling selective frame processing to reduce redundant computation. ReCoVAD consists of two core pathways: (i) a Reflex pathway that uses a lightweight CLIP-based module to fuse visual features with prototype prompts and produce decision vectors, which query a dynamic memory of past frames and anomaly scores for fast response; and (ii) a Conscious pathway that employs a medium-scale vision-language model to generate textual event descriptions and refined anomaly scores for novel frames. It continuously updates the memory and prototype prompts, while an integrated large language model periodically reviews accumulated descriptions to identify unseen anomalies, correct errors, and refine prototypes. Extensive experiments show that ReCoVAD achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance while processing only 28.55\% and 16.04\% of the frames used by previous methods on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating that sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective large-model-based VAD.

Conclusion: 从预训练文本模型中借用知识可以有效增强预训练视觉模型的情感感知能力，PACL方法在视觉情感识别任务中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Visual emotion recognition (VER) is a longstanding field that has garnered increasing attention with the advancement of deep neural networks. Although recent studies have achieved notable improvements by leveraging the knowledge embedded within pre-trained visual models, the lack of direct association between factual-level features and emotional categories, called the "affective gap", limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for VER tasks. On the contrary, the explicit emotional expression and high information density in textual modality eliminate the "affective gap". Therefore, we propose borrowing the knowledge from the pre-trained textual model to enhance the emotional perception of pre-trained visual models. We focus on the factual and emotional connections between images and texts in noisy social media data, and propose Partitioned Adaptive Contrastive Learning (PACL) to leverage these connections. Specifically, we manage to separate different types of samples and devise distinct contrastive learning strategies for each type. By dynamically constructing negative and positive pairs, we fully exploit the potential of noisy samples. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that bridging the "affective gap" significantly improves the performance of various pre-trained visual models in downstream emotion-related tasks. Our code is released on https://github.com/wdqqdw/PACL.

TL;DR: ChainV是一个动态整合视觉提示的多模态推理框架，通过视觉补丁选择和注意力强度分析来缩短推理链，提高推理准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态推理模型在生成长推理链时存在冗余自反思问题，而基于静态视觉参考的CoT压缩方法对多模态推理改进有限。

Method: ChainV首先基于前一步推理进行粗略视觉补丁选择，然后根据平均注意力强度识别最具代表性的原子视觉提示，并通过一致性评估机制评估提示可靠性，最后将像素坐标和可靠性信息通过伯努利随机过程整合到推理中。

Result: 实验表明ChainV显著提高了推理准确性和效率，在MathVista基准上准确率提升2.3%，推理延迟降低51.4%，输出token长度缩短24.5%。

Conclusion: ChainV通过动态整合视觉提示有效解决了多模态推理中的冗余问题，特别在数学密集型任务中表现出色，实现了更短更好的推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal reasoning models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across text and vision. However, even leading models exhibit redundant self-reflection when generating lengthy reasoning chains. While training-free CoT compression methods have emerged in the LLMs domain, they rely on static visual references and thus provide limited gains for multimodal reasoning. Therefore, we propose ChainV, a framework that dynamically integrates visual hints into the reasoning process, thereby making multimodal reasoning shorter and better. Specifically, ChainV first performs a coarse visual patch selection based on the previous reasoning step, then refines it by identifying the most representative atomic visual hint according to the averaged attention intensity. Additionally, ChainV introduces a consistency-based evaluation mechanism to assess the reliability of the chosen hint, guiding the model to adaptively adjust its level of self-reflection. Eventually, the pixel coordinates of the selected visual hint and its reliability are incorporated into thinking with a Bernoulli stochastic process. Experiments indicate that our method significantly improves reasoning accuracy and efficiency, especially on math-intensive benchmarks where visual hints are crucial for multi-step symbolic reasoning. For example, ChainV achieves $2.3\%$ improvement on the MathVista within MIMO-VL-RL, while reducing inference latency by $51.4\%$ and shortening output token length by $24.5\%$.

Abstract: Reconstruction of rigid motion over large spatiotemporal scales remains a challenging task due to limitations in modeling paradigms, severe motion blur, and insufficient physical consistency. In this work, we propose PEGS, a framework that integrates Physical priors with Event stream enhancement within a 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline to perform deblurred target-focused modeling and motion recovery. We introduce a cohesive triple-level supervision scheme that enforces physical plausibility via an acceleration constraint, leverages event streams for high-temporal resolution guidance, and employs a Kalman regularizer to fuse multi-source observations. Furthermore, we design a motion-aware simulated annealing strategy that adaptively schedules the training process based on real-time kinematic states. We also contribute the first RGB-Event paired dataset targeting natural, fast rigid motion across diverse scenarios. Experiments show PEGS's superior performance in reconstructing motion over large spatiotemporal scales compared to mainstream dynamic methods.

Conclusion: 从1D CCT过渡到2D色度空间可提高各种映射方法的比色精度，MLP方法在非普朗克光源下提供稳健的比色映射，计算成本可忽略。

Abstract: Traditional in-camera colorimetric mapping relies on correlated color temperature (CCT)-based interpolation between pre-calibrated transforms optimized for Planckian illuminants such as CIE A and D65. However, modern lighting technologies such as LEDs can deviate substantially from the Planckian locus, exposing the limitations of relying on conventional one-dimensional CCT for illumination characterization. This paper demonstrates that transitioning from 1D CCT (on the Planckian locus) to a 2D chromaticity space (off the Planckian locus) improves colorimetric accuracy across various mapping approaches. In addition, we replace conventional CCT interpolation with a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that leverages 2D chromaticity features for robust colorimetric mapping under non-Planckian illuminants. A lightbox-based calibration procedure incorporating representative LED sources is used to train our MLP. Validated across diverse LED lighting, our method reduces angular reproduction error by 22% on average in LED-lit scenes, maintains backward compatibility with traditional illuminants, accommodates multi-illuminant scenes, and supports real-time in-camera deployment with negligible additional computational cost.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image compression (LIC) has achieved state-of-the-art rate-distortion (RD) performance, yet deploying these models on resource-constrained FPGAs remains a major challenge. This work presents a complete, multi-stage optimization framework to bridge the gap between high-performance floating-point models and efficient, hardware-friendly integer-based implementations. First, we address the fundamental problem of quantization-induced performance degradation. We propose a Dynamic Range-Aware Quantization (DRAQ) method that uses statistically-calibrated activation clipping and a novel weight regularization scheme to counteract the effects of extreme data outliers and large dynamic ranges, successfully creating a high-fidelity 8-bit integer model. Second, building on this robust foundation, we introduce two hardware-aware optimization techniques tailored for FPGAs. A progressive mixed-precision search algorithm exploits FPGA flexibility to assign optimal, non-uniform bit-widths to each layer, minimizing complexity while preserving performance. Concurrently, a channel pruning method, adapted to work with the Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) layers common in LIC, removes model redundancy by eliminating inactive channels. Our comprehensive experiments show that the foundational DRAQ method reduces the BD-rate overhead of a GDN-based model from $30\%$ to $6.3\%$. The subsequent hardware-aware optimizations further reduce computational complexity by over $20\%$ with negligible impact on RD performance, yielding a final model that is both state-of-the-art in efficiency and superior in quality to existing FPGA-based LIC implementations.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have demonstrated remarkable perceptual quality, yet the balance between fidelity and controllability remains a problem: multi-step diffusion-based methods suffer from generative diversity and randomness, resulting in low fidelity, while one-step methods lose control flexibility due to fidelity-specific finetuning. In this paper, we present ODTSR, a one-step diffusion transformer based on Qwen-Image that performs Real-ISR considering fidelity and controllability simultaneously: a newly introduced visual stream receives low-quality images (LQ) with adjustable noise (Control Noise), and the original visual stream receives LQs with consistent noise (Prior Noise), forming the Noise-hybrid Visual Stream (NVS) design. ODTSR further employs Fidelity-aware Adversarial Training (FAA) to enhance controllability and achieve one-step inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ODTSR not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on generic Real-ISR, but also enables prompt controllability on challenging scenarios such as real-world scene text image super-resolution (STISR) of Chinese characters without training on specific datasets.

Conclusion: 通过迭代验证和优化运动规划，SketchVerify在保持高效的同时显著提升了视频生成的运动质量。

Abstract: Recent video generation approaches increasingly rely on planning intermediate control signals such as object trajectories to improve temporal coherence and motion fidelity. However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance.

Result: CC-DiceCE损失提高了检测召回率，分割性能仅有轻微下降，但会产生稍多的假阳性。在多数据集研究中，CC-DiceCE通常优于blob损失。

Conclusion: CC-DiceCE是一种有效的损失函数，能够改善小病灶的检测性能，在医学图像分割中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Traditional loss functions in medical image segmentation, such as Dice, often under-segment small lesions because their small relative volume contributes negligibly to the overall loss. To address this, instance-wise loss functions and metrics have been proposed to evaluate segmentation quality on a per-lesion basis. We introduce CC-DiceCE, a loss function based on the CC-Metrics framework, and compare it with the existing blob loss. Both are benchmarked against a DiceCE baseline within the nnU-Net framework, which provides a robust and standardized setup. We find that CC-DiceCE loss increases detection (recall) with minimal to no degradation in segmentation performance, albeit at the cost of slightly more false positives. Furthermore, our multi-dataset study shows that CC-DiceCE generally outperforms blob loss.

To address this, we propose DMG-YOLO, a lightweight real-time detector tailored for small object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we design a Dual-branch Feature Extraction (DFE) module in the backbone, which partitions feature maps into two parallel branches: one extracts local features via depthwise separable convolutions, and the other captures global context using a vision transformer with a gating mechanism. Additionally, a Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) module with dilated convolutions enhances multi-scale integration while preserving fine details. In the neck, we introduce the Global and Local Aggregate Feature Pyramid Network (GLAFPN) to further boost small object detection through global-local feature fusion.

Abstract: Unlike discriminative approaches in autonomous driving that predict a fixed set of candidate trajectories of the ego vehicle, generative methods, such as diffusion models, learn the underlying distribution of future motion, enabling more flexible trajectory prediction. However, since these methods typically rely on denoising human-crafted trajectory anchors or random noise, there remains significant room for improvement. In this paper, we propose DiffRefiner, a novel two-stage trajectory prediction framework. The first stage uses a transformer-based Proposal Decoder to generate coarse trajectory predictions by regressing from sensor inputs using predefined trajectory anchors. The second stage applies a Diffusion Refiner that iteratively denoises and refines these initial predictions. In this way, we enhance the performance of diffusion-based planning by incorporating a discriminative trajectory proposal module, which provides strong guidance for the generative refinement process. Furthermore, we design a fine-grained denoising decoder to enhance scene compliance, enabling more accurate trajectory prediction through enhanced alignment with the surrounding environment. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffRefiner achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 87.4 EPDMS on NAVSIM v2, and 87.1 DS along with 71.4 SR on Bench2Drive, thereby setting new records on both public benchmarks. The effectiveness of each component is validated via ablation studies as well.

Conclusion: UI-Styler通过类别感知的风格迁移有效解决了超声图像跨设备域偏移问题，在重用黑盒推理模型的情况下显著提升了诊断准确性。

Abstract: The appearance of ultrasound images varies across acquisition devices, causing domain shifts that degrade the performance of fixed black-box downstream inference models when reused. To mitigate this issue, it is practical to develop unpaired image translation (UIT) methods that effectively align the statistical distributions between source and target domains, particularly under the constraint of a reused inference-blackbox setting. However, existing UIT approaches often overlook class-specific semantic alignment during domain adaptation, resulting in misaligned content-class mappings that can impair diagnostic accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose UI-Styler, a novel ultrasound-specific, class-aware image style transfer framework. UI-Styler leverages a pattern-matching mechanism to transfer texture patterns embedded in the target images onto source images while preserving the source structural content. In addition, we introduce a class-aware prompting strategy guided by pseudo labels of the target domain, which enforces accurate semantic alignment with diagnostic categories.

TL;DR: FireScope是一个基于视觉语言模型(VLM)的推理生成框架，通过结合强化学习和视觉监督，从多模态数据中预测野火风险图并生成相应的推理轨迹，实现了跨大陆的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于语言的推理可以提升视觉生成模型的泛化能力；FireScope是首个展示语言推理能改善视觉生成泛化性的框架，也是首个可跨大陆应用的高分辨率野火风险模型。

Abstract: Predicting wildfire risk is a reasoning-intensive spatial problem that requires the integration of visual, climatic, and geographic factors to infer continuous risk maps. Existing methods lack the causal reasoning and multimodal understanding required for reliable generalization. We introduce $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$, a large-scale dataset and benchmark that couples Sentinel-2 imagery and climate data with expert-defined risk rasters across the USA, and real wildfire events in Europe for cross-continental evaluation. Building on this dataset, we propose $\textbf{FireScope}$, a VLM-based reasoning-to-generation framework that learns from both reinforcement learning and visual supervision to predict risk rasters with complementary reasoning traces. When trained in the USA and tested in Europe, $\textbf{FireScope}$ achieves substantial performance gains, while expert feedback and automated analysis confirm that its reasoning traces are faithful and semantically meaningful. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning can ground raster prediction models, improving both generalization and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to (1) demonstrate that language-based reasoning can improve generalization in visual generation, (2) propose a high-resolution wildfire risk model that can be applied across continents, and (3) enable systematic studies of robust cross-continental generalization for multimodal fire risk models. We believe that $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$ has the potential to serve as a foundation for advancing reasoning-driven, interpretable and generalizable spatial modeling. Data and source code will be made publicly available.

*Dragos-Alexandru Boldisor,Stefan Smeu,Dan Oneata,Elisabeta Oneata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了自监督表征在音频-视觉深度伪造检测中的应用潜力，发现这些特征能捕获有意义的信息且具有互补性，但无法可靠地跨数据集泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督表征在视觉和语音任务中表现出色，但在音频-视觉深度伪造检测中的应用潜力尚未充分探索。现有工作要么孤立使用这些特征，要么将其隐藏在复杂架构中。

Method: 系统评估自监督表征在多种模态（音频、视频、多模态）和领域（唇部运动、通用视觉内容）中的表现，从检测效果、编码信息的可解释性和跨模态互补性三个维度进行分析。

Result: 大多数自监督特征能捕获与深度伪造相关的信息，且这些信息具有互补性。模型主要关注语义上有意义的区域而非虚假伪影，但无法可靠地跨数据集泛化。泛化失败源于数据集特性而非特征本身对表面模式的依赖。

Conclusion: 自监督表征在深度伪造检测中既展现出潜力也面临根本挑战：它们能学习有意义的模式，但实现稳健的跨域性能仍然困难。

Abstract: Self-supervised representations excel at many vision and speech tasks, but their potential for audio-visual deepfake detection remains underexplored. Unlike prior work that uses these features in isolation or buried within complex architectures, we systematically evaluate them across modalities (audio, video, multimodal) and domains (lip movements, generic visual content). We assess three key dimensions: detection effectiveness, interpretability of encoded information, and cross-modal complementarity. We find that most self-supervised features capture deepfake-relevant information, and that this information is complementary. Moreover, models primarily attend to semantically meaningful regions rather than spurious artifacts. Yet none generalize reliably across datasets. This generalization failure likely stems from dataset characteristics, not from the features themselves latching onto superficial patterns. These results expose both the promise and fundamental challenges of self-supervised representations for deepfake detection: while they learn meaningful patterns, achieving robust cross-domain performance remains elusive.

Abstract: Traffic signboards are vital for road safety and intelligent transportation systems, enabling navigation and autonomous driving. Yet, recognizing traffic signs at night remains challenging due to visual noise and scarcity of public nighttime datasets. Despite advances in vision architectures, existing methods struggle with robustness under low illumination and fail to leverage complementary mutlimodal cues effectively. To overcome these limitations, firstly, we introduce INTSD, a large-scale dataset comprising street-level night-time images of traffic signboards collected across diverse regions of India. The dataset spans 41 traffic signboard classes captured under varying lighting and weather conditions, providing a comprehensive benchmark for both detection and classification tasks. To benchmark INTSD for night-time sign recognition, we conduct extensive evaluations using state-of-the-art detection and classification models. Secondly, we propose LENS-Net, which integrates an adaptive image enhancement detector for joint illumination correction and sign localization, followed by a structured multimodal CLIP-GCNN classifier that leverages cross-modal attention and graph-based reasoning for robust and semantically consistent recognition. Our method surpasses existing frameworks, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its key components. The dataset and code for LENS-Net is publicly available for research.

Motivation: 现有视频重拍摄方法存在相机运动注入策略不理想的问题，不仅限制了相机控制精度，还导致生成视频无法保留源视频的精细视觉细节。

Method: 提出查询共享交叉注意力模块，将6-DoF相机位姿和2D渲染视频帧融合到共享特征空间中；采用两阶段训练策略：先学习粗粒度相机控制，再结合视觉信息细化运动精度和视觉保真度。

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据集上的实验表明，PostCam在相机控制精度和视角一致性方面比最先进方法提高超过20%，同时达到最高的视频生成质量。

Conclusion: PostCam通过统一的运动表示和两阶段训练策略，实现了更准确、灵活的相机运动操控，显著提升了动态场景中新视角视频的生成质量。

Abstract: We propose PostCam, a framework for novel-view video generation that enables post-capture editing of camera trajectories in dynamic scenes. We find that existing video recapture methods suffer from suboptimal camera motion injection strategies; such suboptimal designs not only limit camera control precision but also result in generated videos that fail to preserve fine visual details from the source video. To achieve more accurate and flexible motion manipulation, PostCam introduces a query-shared cross-attention module. It integrates two distinct forms of control signals: the 6-DoF camera poses and the 2D rendered video frames. By fusing them into a unified representation within a shared feature space, our model can extract underlying motion cues, which enhances both control precision and generation quality. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: the model first learns coarse camera control from pose inputs, and then incorporates visual information to refine motion accuracy and enhance visual fidelity. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that PostCam outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 20% in camera control precision and view consistency, while achieving the highest video generation quality.

Method: 多阶段噪声解耦框架：将噪声分解为显式建模和隐式建模组件；预训练阶段使用现有噪声模型生成配对数据；隐式噪声处理采用高频小波引导网络；采用分离预训练和联合微调的多阶段学习策略。

Conclusion: 所提出的多阶段噪声解耦框架通过分解复杂噪声并采用多阶段学习策略，显著提升了高光谱图像去噪性能，为处理真实复杂噪声提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial step in enhancing the quality of HSIs. Noise modeling methods can fit noise distributions to generate synthetic HSIs to train denoising networks. However, the noise in captured HSIs is usually complex and difficult to model accurately, which significantly limits the effectiveness of these approaches. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage noise-decoupling framework that decomposes complex noise into explicitly modeled and implicitly modeled components. This decoupling reduces the complexity of noise and enhances the learnability of HSI denoising methods when applied to real paired data. Specifically, for explicitly modeled noise, we utilize an existing noise model to generate paired data for pre-training a denoising network, equipping it with prior knowledge to handle the explicitly modeled noise effectively. For implicitly modeled noise, we introduce a high-frequency wavelet guided network. Leveraging the prior knowledge from the pre-trained module, this network adaptively extracts high-frequency features to target and remove the implicitly modeled noise from real paired HSIs. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate all noise components and mitigate error accumulation across stages, a multi-stage learning strategy, comprising separate pre-training and joint fine-tuning, is employed to optimize the entire framework. Extensive experiments on public and our captured datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively handling complex real-world noise and significantly enhancing HSI quality.

Result: 在机器人操作的不同任务中验证了方法的优越性

Conclusion: 所设计的视觉和动作表示共同使机器人操作在空间上平滑、时间上一致

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models show potential for general robotic tasks, but remain challenging in spatiotemporally coherent manipulation, which requires fine-grained representations. Typically, existing methods embed 3D positions into visual representations to enhance the spatial precision of actions. However, these methods struggle to achieve temporally coherent control over action execution. In this work, we propose VLA-4D, a general VLA model with 4D awareness for spatiotemporally coherent robotic manipulation. Our model is guided by two key designs: 1) 4D-aware visual representation. We extract visual features, embed 1D time into 3D positions for 4D embeddings, and fuse them into a unified visual representation via a cross-attention mechanism. 2) Spatiotemporal action representation. We extend conventional spatial action representations with temporal information to enable the spatiotemporal planning, and align the multimodal representations into the LLM for spatiotemporal action prediction. Within this unified framework, the designed visual and action representations jointly make robotic manipulation spatially-smooth and temporally-coherent. In addition, we extend the VLA dataset with temporal action annotations for fine-tuning our model. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the superiority of our method across different tasks of robotic manipulation.

Motivation: 医疗图像分割中，机构间的异构隐私政策使得联合训练不可行，需要持续学习以避免灾难性遗忘。SAM模型参数庞大、计算开销大，限制了实际部署。

Conclusion: CA-SAM方法有效平衡了SAM的计算效率和性能，为医疗图像分割中的持续学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, heterogeneous privacy policies across institutions often make joint training on pooled datasets infeasible, motivating continual image segmentation-learning from data streams without catastrophic forgetting. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers strong zero-shot priors and has been widely fine-tuned across downstream tasks, its large parameter count and computational overhead challenge practical deployment. This paper demonstrates that the SAM paradigm is highly promising once its computational efficiency and performance can be balanced. To this end, we introduce the Alignment Layer, a lightweight, plug-and-play module which aligns encoder-decoder feature distributions to efficiently adapt SAM to specific medical images, improving accuracy while reducing computation. Building on SAM and the Alignment Layer, we then propose Continual Alignment for SAM (CA-SAM), a continual learning strategy that automatically adapts the appropriate Alignment Layer to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, while leveraging SAM's zero-shot priors to preserve strong performance on unseen medical datasets. Experimented across nine medical segmentation datasets under continual-learning scenario, CA-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code, models and datasets will be released on \mbox{https://github.com/azzzzyo/Continual-Alignment-for-SAM.}

Conclusion: SING3R-SLAM通过全局高斯表示有效解决了SLAM中的漂移和冗余问题，为多种下游应用提供了高效且高质量的3D建图解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction enable the accurate capture of local geometry; however, integrating them into SLAM is challenging due to drift and redundant point maps, which limit efficiency and downstream tasks, such as novel view synthesis. To address these issues, we propose SING3R-SLAM, a globally consistent and compact Gaussian-based dense RGB SLAM framework. The key idea is to combine locally consistent 3D reconstructions with a unified global Gaussian representation that jointly refines scene geometry and camera poses, enabling efficient and versatile 3D mapping for multiple downstream applications. SING3R-SLAM first builds locally consistent submaps through our lightweight tracking and reconstruction module, and then progressively aligns and fuses them into a global Gaussian map that enforces cross-view geometric consistency. This global map, in turn, provides feedback to correct local drift and enhance the robustness of tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SING3R-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking, 3D reconstruction, and novel view rendering, resulting in over 12% improvement in tracking and producing finer, more detailed geometry, all while maintaining a compact and memory-efficient global representation on real-world datasets.

Motivation: 解决3D CT面临的独特挑战：极端token扩展、几何各向异性、弱/噪声临床监督，使标准Transformer和对比学习方法难以直接应用。

Method: 联合优化局部Transformer进行高分辨率体积特征提取和全局Transformer进行全扫描上下文建模，结合DINO自蒸馏和基于SigLIP的视觉-语言对齐预训练。

Result: 在多个CT基准测试中，SPECTRE在零样本和微调设置下始终优于先前的CT基础模型。

Conclusion: SPECTRE证明了无需依赖私有数据即可实现高性能、可泛化的CT表示，是3D医学成像的可扩展、开放、完全基于Transformer的基础模型。

Abstract: We introduce SPECTRE, a fully transformer-based foundation model for volumetric computed tomography (CT). Our Self-Supervised & Cross-Modal Pretraining for CT Representation Extraction (SPECTRE) approach utilizes scalable 3D Vision Transformer architectures and modern self-supervised and vision-language pretraining strategies to learn general-purpose CT representations. Volumetric CT poses unique challenges, such as extreme token scaling, geometric anisotropy, and weak or noisy clinical supervision, that make standard transformer and contrastive learning recipes ineffective out of the box. The framework jointly optimizes a local transformer for high-resolution volumetric feature extraction and a global transformer for whole-scan context modeling, making large-scale 3D attention computationally tractable. Notably, SPECTRE is trained exclusively on openly available CT datasets, demonstrating that high-performing, generalizable representations can be achieved without relying on private data. Pretraining combines DINO-style self-distillation with SigLIP-based vision-language alignment using paired radiology reports, yielding features that are both geometrically consistent and clinically meaningful. Across multiple CT benchmarks, SPECTRE consistently outperforms prior CT foundation models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, establishing SPECTRE as a scalable, open, and fully transformer-based foundation model for 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: Accurate BEV semantic segmentation from fisheye imagery remains challenging due to extreme non-linear distortion, occlusion, and depth ambiguity inherent to wide-angle projections. We present a distortion-aware BEV segmentation framework that directly processes multi-camera high-resolution fisheye images,utilizing calibrated geometric unprojection and per-pixel depth distribution estimation. Each image pixel is lifted into 3D space via Gaussian parameterization, predicting spatial means and anisotropic covariances to explicitly model geometric uncertainty. The projected 3D Gaussians are fused into a BEV representation via differentiable splatting, producing continuous, uncertainty-aware semantic maps without requiring undistortion or perspective rectification. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong segmentation performance on complex parking and urban driving scenarios, achieving IoU scores of 87.75% for drivable regions and 57.26% for vehicles under severe fisheye distortion and diverse environmental conditions.

Conclusion: 提出的双域自适应网络能有效将预训练SR模型从模拟适配到真实世界数据集，在真实图像超分辨率任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Realistic image super-resolution (SR) focuses on transforming real-world low-resolution (LR) images into high-resolution (HR) ones, handling more complex degradation patterns than synthetic SR tasks. This is critical for applications like surveillance, medical imaging, and consumer electronics. However, current methods struggle with limited real-world LR-HR data, impacting the learning of basic image features. Pre-trained SR models from large-scale synthetic datasets offer valuable prior knowledge, which can improve generalization, speed up training, and reduce the need for extensive real-world data in realistic SR tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Dual-domain Adaptation Networks, which is able to efficiently adapt pre-trained image SR models from simulated to real-world datasets. To achieve this target, we first set up a spatial-domain adaptation strategy through selectively updating parameters of pre-trained models and employing the low-rank adaptation technique to adjust frozen parameters. Recognizing that image super-resolution involves recovering high-frequency components, we further integrate a frequency domain adaptation branch into the adapted model, which combines the spectral data of the input and the spatial-domain backbone's intermediate features to infer HR frequency maps, enhancing the SR result. Experimental evaluations on public realistic image SR benchmarks, including RealSR, D2CRealSR, and DRealSR, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖2D渲染一致性，3D结构仅隐式出现；要么依赖离散化的体素网格，限制了空间精度和可扩展性。需要一种能直接学习连续3D语义占据的方法。

Method: 使用独立的4D时空查询采样相邻帧，支持从视觉基础模型生成的伪点云或原始激光雷达数据进行监督，引入收缩场景表示来保持近场细节同时压缩远场区域。

Result: 在自监督Occ3D-nuScenes基准测试中，语义RayIoU比之前的相机方法提高了26%，运行速度为11.6 FPS。

Conclusion: 直接的4D查询监督能够实现强大的自监督占据学习。

Abstract: Learning 3D scene geometry and semantics from images is a core challenge in computer vision and a key capability for autonomous driving. Since large-scale 3D annotation is prohibitively expensive, recent work explores self-supervised learning directly from sensor data without manual labels. Existing approaches either rely on 2D rendering consistency, where 3D structure emerges only implicitly, or on discretized voxel grids from accumulated lidar point clouds, limiting spatial precision and scalability. We introduce QueryOcc, a query-based self-supervised framework that learns continuous 3D semantic occupancy directly through independent 4D spatio-temporal queries sampled across adjacent frames. The framework supports supervision from either pseudo-point clouds derived from vision foundation models or raw lidar data. To enable long-range supervision and reasoning under constant memory, we introduce a contractive scene representation that preserves near-field detail while smoothly compressing distant regions. QueryOcc surpasses previous camera-based methods by 26% in semantic RayIoU on the self-supervised Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark while running at 11.6 FPS, demonstrating that direct 4D query supervision enables strong self-supervised occupancy learning. https://research.zenseact.com/publications/queryocc/

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework combining group equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) with equivariant-aware structured pruning to produce compact, transformation-invariant models for resource-constrained environments. Equivariance to rotations is achieved through the C4 cyclic group via the e2cnn library,enabling consistent performance under geometric transformations while reducing computational overhead.
  Our approach introduces structured pruning that preserves equivariant properties by analyzing e2cnn layer structure and applying neuron-level pruning to fully connected components. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we implement adaptive fine-tuning that automatically triggers when accuracy drop exceeds 2%, using early stopping and learning rate scheduling for efficient recovery. The framework includes dynamic INT8 quantization and a comprehensive pipeline encompassing training, knowledge distillation, structured pruning, fine-tuning, and quantization.
  We evaluate our method on satellite imagery (EuroSAT) and standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10, Rotated MNIST) demonstrating effectiveness across diverse domains. Experimental results show 29.3% parameter reduction with significant accuracy recovery, demonstrating that structured pruning of equivariant networks achieves substantial compression while maintaining geometric robustness. Our pipeline provides a reproducible framework for optimizing equivariant models, bridging the gap between group-theoretic network design and practical deployment constraints, with particular relevance to satellite imagery analysis and geometric vision tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenging problem of blind deconvolution for color images. Existing methods often convert color images to grayscale or process each color channel separately, which overlooking the relationships between color channels. To handle this issue, we formulate a novel quaternion fidelity term designed specifically for color image blind deconvolution. This fidelity term leverages the properties of quaternion convolution kernel, which consists of four kernels: one that functions similarly to a non-negative convolution kernel to capture the overall blur, and three additional convolution kernels without constraints corresponding to red, green and blue channels respectively model their unknown interdependencies. In order to preserve image intensity, we propose to use the normalized quaternion kernel in the blind deconvolution process. Extensive experiments on real datasets of blurred color images show that the proposed method effectively removes artifacts and significantly improves deblurring effect, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for color image deconvolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个针对大型视觉语言模型幻觉问题的综合干预框架，发现幻觉源于图像-输入文本、图像-输出文本和文本-文本路径的相互作用，并提出针对不同问答格式的干预方法。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但它们仍然容易产生幻觉。本研究旨在解决这一关键问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法能够持续减少不同类型对齐的幻觉现象。

Conclusion: LVLMs的幻觉问题不是由单一因果路径引起的，而是多个路径相互作用的结果，针对不同问答格式的路径干预能有效减少幻觉。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain prone to hallucination. In this study, we propose a comprehensive intervention framework aligned with the transformer's causal architecture in LVLMs, integrating the effects of different intervention paths on hallucination. We find that hallucinations in LVLMs do not arise from a single causal path, but rather from the interplay among image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, and text-to-text pathways. For the first time, we also find that LVLMs rely on different pathways depending on the question-answer alignment format. Building on these insights, we propose simple yet effective methods to identify and intervene on critical hallucination heads within each pathway, tailored to discriminative and generative formats. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces hallucinations across diverse alignment types.

### [126] [A Little More Like This: Text-to-Image Retrieval with Vision-Language Models Using Relevance Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17255)
*Bulat Khaertdinov,Mirela Popa,Nava Tintarev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于相关性反馈的视觉语言模型检索增强方法，包括伪相关性反馈、生成式相关性反馈、注意力反馈总结器和显式反馈四种策略，能够在不进行微调的情况下提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型虽然支持自然语言视觉搜索，但提升性能通常需要微调或使用更大模型。本文旨在通过相关性反馈机制在推理时改善检索性能，这种模型无关的设计既可作为微调的替代方案，也可与微调后的模型配合使用。

Method: 提出了四种反馈策略：1）经典伪相关性反馈（PRF），基于排名靠前的结果优化查询嵌入；2）生成式相关性反馈（GRF），使用合成标题进行查询优化；3）注意力反馈总结器（AFS），基于Transformer的多模态细粒度特征整合模型；4）使用真实标题的显式反馈作为上限基准。

Result: 在Flickr30k和COCO数据集上的实验表明，GRF、AFS和显式反馈相比无反馈检索，在较小VLM上MRR@5提升3-5%，在较大VLM上提升1-3%。AFS与显式反馈类似，能缓解查询漂移，在多轮迭代检索中比GRF更稳健。

Conclusion: 相关性反馈能够持续增强不同VLM的检索性能，为交互式和自适应视觉搜索开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable intuitive visual search using natural language queries. However, improving their performance often requires fine-tuning and scaling to larger model variants. In this work, we propose a mechanism inspired by traditional text-based search to improve retrieval performance at inference time: relevance feedback. While relevance feedback can serve as an alternative to fine-tuning, its model-agnostic design also enables use with fine-tuned VLMs. Specifically, we introduce and evaluate four feedback strategies for VLM-based retrieval. First, we revise classical pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), which refines query embeddings based on top-ranked results. To address its limitations, we propose generative relevance feedback (GRF), which uses synthetic captions for query refinement. Furthermore, we introduce an attentive feedback summarizer (AFS), a custom transformer-based model that integrates multimodal fine-grained features from relevant items. Finally, we simulate explicit feedback using ground-truth captions as an upper-bound baseline. Experiments on Flickr30k and COCO with the VLM backbones show that GRF, AFS, and explicit feedback improve retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for smaller VLMs, and 1-3% for larger ones, compared to retrieval with no feedback. Moreover, AFS, similarly to explicit feedback, mitigates query drift and is more robust than GRF in iterative, multi-turn retrieval settings. Our findings demonstrate that relevance feedback can consistently enhance retrieval across VLMs and open up opportunities for interactive and adaptive visual search.

Result: 在KITTI-360数据集上验证了高质量LiDAR点云生成能力，能够产生复杂边缘案例和动态场景。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成多样化LiDAR数据提供了成本效益高且可扩展的解决方案，有助于提升自动驾驶系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Training autonomous driving and navigation systems requires large and diverse point cloud datasets that capture complex edge case scenarios from various dynamic urban settings. Acquiring such diverse scenarios from real-world point cloud data, especially for critical edge cases, is challenging, which restricts system generalization and robustness. Current methods rely on simulating point cloud data within handcrafted 3D virtual environments, which is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and often fails to fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. To address some of these issues, this research proposes a novel approach that addresses the problem discussed by editing real-world LiDAR scans using semantic mask-based guidance to generate novel synthetic LiDAR point clouds. We incorporate range image projection and semantic mask conditioning to achieve diffusion-based generation. Point clouds are transformed to 2D range view images, which are used as an intermediate representation to enable semantic editing using convex hull-based semantic masks. These masks guide the generation process by providing information on the dimensions, orientations, and locations of objects in the real environment, ensuring geometric consistency and realism. This approach demonstrates high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation, capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, as validated on the KITTI-360 dataset. This offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating diverse LiDAR data, a step toward improving the robustness of autonomous driving systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多语言T2I模型在处理多语言提示时往往产生文化中性或英语偏向的结果，缺乏跨语言文化一致性。

Method: 提出探测方法定位文化敏感神经元，并引入两种对齐策略：推理时文化激活和层定向文化增强。

Result: 在CultureBench上的实验显示，相比强基线方法在文化一致性方面有持续改进，同时保持保真度和多样性。

Conclusion: 通过定位和增强文化相关神经元，可以有效提升多语言T2I模型的文化一致性，而无需对整个模型进行微调。

Abstract: Multilingual text-to-image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly in terms of visual realism and semantic alignment, and are now widely utilized. Yet outputs vary across cultural contexts: because language carries cultural connotations, images synthesized from multilingual prompts should preserve cross-lingual cultural consistency. We conduct a comprehensive analysis showing that current T2I models often produce culturally neutral or English-biased results under multilingual prompts. Analyses of two representative models indicate that the issue stems not from missing cultural knowledge but from insufficient activation of culture-related representations. We propose a probing method that localizes culture-sensitive signals to a small set of neurons in a few fixed layers. Guided by this finding, we introduce two complementary alignment strategies: (1) inference-time cultural activation that amplifies the identified neurons without backbone fine-tuned; and (2) layer-targeted cultural enhancement that updates only culturally relevant layers. Experiments on our CultureBench demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines in cultural consistency while preserving fidelity and diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OCSR系统在准确识别立体化学信息方面面临重大挑战，因为区分立体异构体的视觉线索（如楔形和虚线键、环构象和空间排列）非常微妙。

Method: 采用三阶段训练范式：1）在大规模噪声数据集上进行预训练；2）使用具有更丰富监督信号的数据集进行多粒度微调，探索化学键分类和原子定位等辅助任务；3）使用强化学习进行后训练优化，并引入新的立体化学结构数据集。

Result: MolSight在多个数据集上实现了最先进的（立体）化学光学结构识别性能，即使参数规模相对紧凑，GRPO算法也能进一步提升模型在立体分子识别上的表现。

Conclusion: MolSight框架通过创新的三阶段训练方法，有效解决了OCSR中立体化学信息识别的关键挑战，为化学信息学、药物发现和LLM应用提供了强大的工具。

Abstract: Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) plays a pivotal role in modern chemical informatics, enabling the automated conversion of chemical structure images from scientific literature, patents, and educational materials into machine-readable molecular representations. This capability is essential for large-scale chemical data mining, drug discovery pipelines, and Large Language Model (LLM) applications in related domains. However, existing OCSR systems face significant challenges in accurately recognizing stereochemical information due to the subtle visual cues that distinguish stereoisomers, such as wedge and dash bonds, ring conformations, and spatial arrangements. To address these challenges, we propose MolSight, a comprehensive learning framework for OCSR that employs a three-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, we conduct pre-training on large-scale but noisy datasets to endow the model with fundamental perception capabilities for chemical structure images. In the second stage, we perform multi-granularity fine-tuning using datasets with richer supervisory signals, systematically exploring how auxiliary tasks-specifically chemical bond classification and atom localization-contribute to molecular formula recognition. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning for post-training optimization and introduce a novel stereochemical structure dataset. Remarkably, we find that even with MolSight's relatively compact parameter size, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm can further enhance the model's performance on stereomolecular. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, our results demonstrate that MolSight achieves state-of-the-art performance in (stereo)chemical optical structure recognition.

Abstract: Finger pose offers promising opportunities to expand human computer interaction capability of touchscreen devices. Existing finger pose estimation algorithms that can be implemented in portable devices predominantly rely on capacitive images, which are currently limited to estimating pitch and yaw angles and exhibit reduced accuracy when processing large-angle inputs (especially when it is greater than 45 degrees). In this paper, we propose BiFingerPose, a novel bimodal based finger pose estimation algorithm capable of simultaneously and accurately predicting comprehensive finger pose information. A bimodal input is explored, including a capacitive image and a fingerprint patch obtained from the touchscreen with an under-screen fingerprint sensor. Our approach leads to reliable estimation of roll angle, which is not achievable using only a single modality. In addition, the prediction performance of other pose parameters has also been greatly improved. The evaluation of a 12-person user study on continuous and discrete interaction tasks further validated the advantages of our approach. Specifically, BiFingerPose outperforms previous SOTA methods with over 21% improvement in prediction performance, 2.5 times higher task completion efficiency, and 23% better user operation accuracy, demonstrating its practical superiority. Finally, we delineate the application space of finger pose with respect to enhancing authentication security and improving interactive experiences, and develop corresponding prototypes to showcase the interaction potential. Our code will be available at https://github.com/XiongjunGuan/DualFingerPose.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在空间推理能力上存在局限，主要原因是视觉编码器（如CLIP）只关注实例级语义特征而忽略了空间几何信息，导致空间模糊性。

Method: 提出基于几何和语义特征分层融合的新型视觉编码器，通过分层适配器将自监督学习的几何特征补充到CLIP中，使用随机特征丢弃训练避免对CLIP编码器的过度依赖。

Result: 在空间推理任务中准确率显著提升，在SpatialRGPT-Bench上比现有最优模型至少提高8.0%，推理时内存消耗减少约50%。

Conclusion: SpatialGeo通过增强空间感知能力有效提升了MLLMs的空间推理性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant progress in image and language tasks due to the strong reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). Nevertheless, most MLLMs suffer from limited spatial reasoning ability to interpret and infer spatial arrangements in three-dimensional space. In this work, we propose a novel vision encoder based on hierarchical fusion of geometry and semantics features, generating spatial-aware visual embedding and boosting the spatial grounding capability of MLLMs. Specifically, we first unveil that the spatial ambiguity shortcoming stems from the lossy embedding of the vision encoder utilized in most existing MLLMs (e.g., CLIP), restricted to instance-level semantic features. This motivates us to complement CLIP with the geometry features from vision-only self-supervised learning via a hierarchical adapter, enhancing the spatial awareness in the proposed SpatialGeo. The network is efficiently trained using pretrained LLaVA model and optimized with random feature dropping to avoid trivial solutions relying solely on the CLIP encoder. Experimental results show that SpatialGeo improves the accuracy in spatial reasoning tasks, enhancing state-of-the-art models by at least 8.0% in SpatialRGPT-Bench with approximately 50% less memory cost during inference.

TL;DR: MuM通过扩展MAE到任意多视图，使用统一掩码和轻量级解码器，在3D视觉任务中超越了DINOv3和CroCo v2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法主要优化语义理解而非几何推理，CroCo虽然针对3D理解但仍有改进空间。

Method: 将MAE扩展到任意多视图，统一掩码所有视图，使用轻量级解码器和帧间注意力机制。

Result: 在重建、密集图像匹配和相对姿态估计等下游任务中，性能优于DINOv3和CroCo v2。

Conclusion: MuM提供了一种更简单、可扩展的多视图自监督学习方法，在3D视觉任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning on images seeks to extract meaningful visual representations from unlabeled data. When scaled to large datasets, this paradigm has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the resulting trained models such as DINOv3 have seen widespread adoption. However, most prior efforts are optimized for semantic understanding rather than geometric reasoning. One important exception is Cross-View Completion, CroCo, which is a form of masked autoencoding (MAE) tailored for 3D understanding. In this work, we continue on the path proposed by CroCo and focus on learning features tailored for 3D vision. In a nutshell, we extend MAE to arbitrarily many views of the same scene. By uniformly masking all views and employing a lightweight decoder with inter-frame attention, our approach is inherently simpler and more scalable than CroCo. We evaluate the resulting model, MuM, extensively on downstream tasks including feedforward reconstruction, dense image matching and relative pose estimation, finding that it outperforms the state-of-the-art visual encoders DINOv3 and CroCo v2.

TL;DR: NoPe-NeRF++是一种无需姿态先验的局部到全局优化算法，用于训练神经辐射场(NeRF)。它通过相对姿态初始化、局部联合优化和全局束调整，显著提高了姿态估计精度和NeRF质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法(特别是NoPe-NeRF)仅关注图像局部关系，在复杂场景中难以恢复准确的相机姿态。需要结合局部和全局线索来提升姿态估计和NeRF表示的质量。

Method: 1) 基于显式特征匹配的相对姿态初始化；2) 局部联合优化增强姿态估计；3) 全局优化阶段通过束调整整合特征轨迹，结合几何一致性约束。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法在姿态估计精度和新视角合成方面优于现有最先进方法，在挑战性场景中表现出优越性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NoPe-NeRF++是首个将局部和全局线索与NeRF无缝结合的工作，验证了设计选择的合理性，在复杂场景中实现了更好的姿态估计和NeRF质量。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce NoPe-NeRF++, a novel local-to-global optimization algorithm for training Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) without requiring pose priors. Existing methods, particularly NoPe-NeRF, which focus solely on the local relationships within images, often struggle to recover accurate camera poses in complex scenarios. To overcome the challenges, our approach begins with a relative pose initialization with explicit feature matching, followed by a local joint optimization to enhance the pose estimation for training a more robust NeRF representation. This method significantly improves the quality of initial poses. Additionally, we introduce global optimization phase that incorporates geometric consistency constraints through bundle adjustment, which integrates feature trajectories to further refine poses and collectively boost the quality of NeRF. Notably, our method is the first work that seamlessly combines the local and global cues with NeRF, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pose estimation accuracy and novel view synthesis. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate our superior performance and robustness, even in challenging scenes, thus validating our design choices.

Conclusion: 通过引入物理光学约束和像素同步机制，显著提升了生成模型在透明物体渲染方面的表现，特别是折射效果的准确性。

Abstract: Generative image models can produce convincingly real images, with plausible shapes, textures, layouts and lighting. However, one domain in which they perform notably poorly is in the synthesis of transparent objects, which exhibit refraction, reflection, absorption and scattering. Refraction is a particular challenge, because refracted pixel rays often intersect with surfaces observed in other parts of the image, providing a constraint on the color. It is clear from inspection that generative models have not distilled the laws of optics sufficiently well to accurately render refractive objects. In this work, we consider the problem of generating images with accurate refraction, given a text prompt. We synchronize the pixels within the object's boundary with those outside by warping and merging the pixels using Snell's Law of Refraction, at each step of the generation trajectory. For those surfaces that are not directly observed in the image, but are visible via refraction or reflection, we recover their appearance by synchronizing the image with a second generated image -- a panorama centered at the object -- using the same warping and merging procedure. We demonstrate that our approach generates much more optically-plausible images that respect the physical constraints.

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成跨媒介一致、时间连贯的绘画过程，成功模拟了人类艺术创作的构图、色彩块面和细节精炼等阶段。

Abstract: Step-by-step painting tutorials are vital for learning artistic techniques, but existing video resources (e.g., YouTube) lack interactivity and personalization. While recent generative models have advanced artistic image synthesis, they struggle to generalize across media and often show temporal or structural inconsistencies, hindering faithful reproduction of human creative workflows. To address this, we propose a unified framework for multi-media painting process generation with a semantics-driven style control mechanism that embeds multiple media into a diffusion models conditional space and uses cross-medium style augmentation. This enables consistent texture evolution and process transfer across styles. A reverse-painting training strategy further ensures smooth, human-aligned generation. We also build a large-scale dataset of real painting processes and evaluate cross-media consistency, temporal coherence, and final-image fidelity, achieving strong results on LPIPS, DINO, and CLIP metrics. Finally, our Perceptual Distance Profile (PDP) curve quantitatively models the creative sequence, i.e., composition, color blocking, and detail refinement, mirroring human artistic progression.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition is a hotspot in image processing. A key challenge of this task lies in its dependence on large, manually labeled datasets whose acquisition is costly and time-consuming. This paper devises a novel, label-efficient method for skeleton-based action recognition using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The contribution of the proposed method resides in learning a novel acquisition function -- scoring the most informative subsets for labeling -- as the optimum of an objective function mixing data representativity, diversity and uncertainty. We also extend this approach by learning the most informative subsets using an invertible GCN which allows mapping data from ambient to latent spaces where the inherent distribution of the data is more easily captured. Extensive experiments, conducted on two challenging skeleton-based recognition datasets, show the effectiveness and the outperformance of our label-frugal GCNs against the related work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的I-JEPA方法对所有区域进行统一独立处理，缺乏对预测顺序和位置的明确指导。受人类视觉感知启发，需要选择性、顺序性地从最信息丰富到次要区域进行注意力部署。

Conclusion: DSeq-JEPA成功将预测式自监督学习与自回归式学习相结合，通过顺序判别预测显著提升了表示学习效果。

Abstract: Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (I-JEPA) learns visual representations by predicting latent embeddings of masked regions from visible context. However, it treats all regions uniformly and independently, lacking an explicit notion of where or in what order predictions should be made. Inspired by human visual perception, which deploys attention selectively and sequentially from the most informative to secondary regions, we propose DSeq-JEPA, a Discriminative Sequential Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture that bridges predictive and autoregressive self-supervised learning, integrating JEPA-style latent prediction with GPT-style sequential reasoning. Specifically, DSeq-JEPA (i) first identifies primary discriminative regions based on a transformer-derived saliency map, emphasizing the distribution of visual importance, and then (ii) predicts subsequent regions in this discriminative order, progressively forming a curriculum-like semantic progression from primary to secondary cues -- a form of GPT-style pre-training. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including image classification (ImageNet), fine-grained visual categorization (iNaturalist21, CUB-200-2011, Stanford-Cars), detection and segmentation (MS-COCO, ADE20K), and low-level reasoning tasks (Clevr/Count, Clevr/Dist), demonstrate that DSeq-JEPA consistently focuses on more discriminative and generalizable representations than I-JEPA variants.

Abstract: Cell-level radiomics features provide fine-grained insights into tumor phenotypes and have the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images. By capturing micro-level morphological and intensity patterns, these features support more precise tumor identification and improve AI interpretability by highlighting diagnostically relevant cells for pathologist review. However, most existing studies focus on slide-level or patch-level tumor classification, leaving cell-level radiomics analysis largely unexplored. Moreover, there is currently no dedicated backbone specifically designed for radiomics data. Inspired by the recent success of the Mamba architecture in vision and language domains, we introduce a Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone for cell-level classification using radiomics features. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that integrate Attention and Mamba modules in fixed proportions, our unified design flexibly combines their capabilities within a single cohesive architecture, eliminating the need for manual ratio tuning and improving encode capability. We develop two UAM variants to comprehensively evaluate the benefits of this unified structure. Building on this backbone, we further propose a multimodal UAM framework that jointly performs cell-level classification and image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that UAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks on public benchmarks, surpassing leading image-based foundation models. It improves cell classification accuracy from 74% to 78% ($n$=349,882 cells), and tumor segmentation precision from 75% to 80% ($n$=406 patches). These findings highlight the effectiveness and promise of UAM as a unified and extensible multimodal foundation for radiomics-driven cancer diagnosis.

*Seamie Hayes,Reenu Mohandas,Tim Brophy,Alexandre Boulch,Ganesh Sistu,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperQuadricOcc提出了一种基于超二次曲面的语义占据估计方法，通过多层级球面高斯近似实现训练监督，相比传统高斯方法减少75%内存占用、提升124%推理速度，并在mIoU上提升5.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯表示在自监督占据估计中广泛使用，但大量高斯基元会显著增加内存需求，不适合实时推理。超二次曲面可以减少基元数量和内存需求，但缺乏超二次曲面光栅化器来实现模型监督。

Method: 采用超二次曲面场景表示，通过多层级球面细分的高斯近似来模拟超二次曲面，从而在训练期间实现高斯光栅化监督。

Result: 在Occ3D数据集上，相比之前的高斯方法，内存占用减少75%，推理速度提升124%，mIoU提升5.9%，基元数量减少84%，首次实现实时推理同时保持竞争力性能。

Conclusion: SuperQuadricOcc是第一个能够实现实时推理的占据模型，通过超二次曲面表示显著减少了基元数量和内存需求，同时保持了竞争性性能。

Abstract: Semantic occupancy estimation enables comprehensive scene understanding for automated driving, providing dense spatial and semantic information essential for perception and planning. While Gaussian representations have been widely adopted in self-supervised occupancy estimation, the deployment of a large number of Gaussian primitives drastically increases memory requirements and is not suitable for real-time inference. In contrast, superquadrics permit reduced primitive count and lower memory requirements due to their diverse shape set. However, implementation into a self-supervised occupancy model is nontrivial due to the absence of a superquadric rasterizer to enable model supervision. Our proposed method, SuperQuadricOcc, employs a superquadric-based scene representation. By leveraging a multi-layer icosphere-tessellated Gaussian approximation of superquadrics, we enable Gaussian rasterization for supervision during training. On the Occ3D dataset, SuperQuadricOcc achieves a 75\% reduction in memory footprint, 124\% faster inference, and a 5.9\% improvement in mIoU compared to previous Gaussian-based methods, without the use of temporal labels. To our knowledge, this is the first occupancy model to enable real-time inference while maintaining competitive performance. The use of superquadrics reduces the number of primitives required for scene modeling by 84\% relative to Gaussian-based approaches. Finally, evaluation against prior methods is facilitated by our fast superquadric voxelization module. The code will be released as open source.

*Linxiang Su,András Balogh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ATAC方法，通过在CLIP嵌入空间中使用增强诱导漂移向量来推断语义恢复方向，显著提升了对抗攻击下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在零样本图像-文本匹配方面表现出色，但对图像对抗扰动高度脆弱。对抗微调成本高昂，现有测试时防御方法鲁棒性有限。

Method: 在CLIP嵌入空间中计算增强诱导漂移向量，基于这些潜在漂移的角度一致性推断语义恢复方向并修正嵌入。

Result: 在各种基准测试中，ATAC始终实现极高的鲁棒性，平均比先前最先进方法高出近50%，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: ATAC是CLIP嵌入空间中测试时对抗防御新范式的有效方法，在非常规和极端设置下保持最先进鲁棒性，甚至对自适应攻击也表现出非平凡鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite its remarkable success in zero-shot image-text matching, CLIP remains highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on images. As adversarial fine-tuning is prohibitively costly, recent works explore various test-time defense strategies; however, these approaches still exhibit limited robustness. In this work, we revisit this problem and propose a simple yet effective strategy: Augmentation-based Test-time Adversarial Correction (ATAC). Our method operates directly in the embedding space of CLIP, calculating augmentation-induced drift vectors to infer a semantic recovery direction and correcting the embedding based on the angular consistency of these latent drifts. Across a wide range of benchmarks, ATAC consistently achieves remarkably high robustness, surpassing that of previous state-of-the-art methods by nearly 50\% on average, all while requiring minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, ATAC retains state-of-the-art robustness in unconventional and extreme settings and even achieves nontrivial robustness against adaptive attacks. Our results demonstrate that ATAC is an efficient method in a novel paradigm for test-time adversarial defenses in the embedding space of CLIP.

TL;DR: SVRecon将稀疏体素光栅化与SDF结合用于高保真表面重建，通过几何初始化和空间平滑损失解决稀疏体素优化中的局部极小值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏体素在优化过程中容易陷入局部极小值，而SDF能提供平滑连续的几何场，但如何在独立参数化的稀疏体素间保持这种平滑性是一个挑战。

Method: 使用视觉几何模型进行鲁棒几何初始化，并通过空间平滑损失在父子体素和兄弟体素组间强制执行一致关系。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现出强大的重建精度和一致的快速收敛速度。

Conclusion: SVRecon方法在保持快速收敛的同时实现了高精度的表面重建。

Abstract: We extend the recently proposed sparse voxel rasterization paradigm to the task of high-fidelity surface reconstruction by integrating Signed Distance Function (SDF), named SVRecon. Unlike 3D Gaussians, sparse voxels are spatially disentangled from their neighbors and have sharp boundaries, which makes them prone to local minima during optimization. Although SDF values provide a naturally smooth and continuous geometric field, preserving this smoothness across independently parameterized sparse voxels is nontrivial. To address this challenge, we promote coherent and smooth voxel-wise structure through (1) robust geometric initialization using a visual geometry model and (2) a spatial smoothness loss that enforces coherent relationships across parent-child and sibling voxel groups. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks show that our method achieves strong reconstruction accuracy while having consistently speedy convergence. The code will be made public.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了非参数概率鲁棒性(NPPR)，一种不依赖预定义扰动分布的实用概率鲁棒性度量方法，通过从数据中学习优化的扰动分布来在分布不确定性下进行保守的鲁棒性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概率鲁棒性(PR)方法假设固定且已知的扰动分布，这在实践中是不现实的，需要更实用的鲁棒性度量方法。

Method: 基于高斯混合模型(GMM)与多层感知器(MLP)头和双三次上采样的NPPR估计器，涵盖输入依赖和输入独立的扰动场景。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny ImageNet数据集上的实验验证了NPPR作为更实用的鲁棒性度量，相比现有方法显示出高达40%更保守的PR估计。

Conclusion: NPPR是概率鲁棒性的更实用度量，能够处理分布不确定性，为深度学习模型的鲁棒性评估提供了更现实的框架。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models, despite their remarkable success, remain vulnerable to small input perturbations that can cause erroneous outputs, motivating the recent proposal of probabilistic robustness (PR) as a complementary alternative to adversarial robustness (AR). However, existing PR formulations assume a fixed and known perturbation distribution, an unrealistic expectation in practice. To address this limitation, we propose non-parametric probabilistic robustness (NPPR), a more practical PR metric that does not rely on any predefined perturbation distribution. Following the non-parametric paradigm in statistical modeling, NPPR learns an optimized perturbation distribution directly from data, enabling conservative PR evaluation under distributional uncertainty. We further develop an NPPR estimator based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) heads and bicubic up-sampling, covering various input-dependent and input-independent perturbation scenarios. Theoretical analyses establish the relationships among AR, PR, and NPPR. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet across ResNet18/50, WideResNet50 and VGG16 validate NPPR as a more practical robustness metric, showing up to 40\% more conservative (lower) PR estimates compared to assuming those common perturbation distributions used in state-of-the-arts.

TL;DR: MorphSeek是一个用于可变形图像配准的细粒度表示级策略优化框架，通过在高维潜在特征空间中建模空间连续优化过程，解决了传统方法在捕捉空间变化变形方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可变形图像配准面临高维变形空间和体素级监督稀缺的挑战，现有强化学习方法通常将空间投影到粗粒度的低维表示，限制了捕捉空间变化变形的能力。

Method: 在编码器顶部引入随机高斯策略头来建模潜在特征的分布，实现高效探索和从粗到细的优化。结合无监督预热和弱监督微调，通过多轨迹采样稳定训练并提高标签效率。

Result: 在三个3D配准基准测试（OASIS脑部MRI、LiTS肝脏CT和腹部MR-CT）中，MorphSeek相比竞争基线实现了持续的Dice改进，同时保持高标签效率和低参数成本。

Conclusion: MorphSeek推进了表示级策略学习范式，实现了空间一致和数据高效的变形优化，为高维环境中的可扩展视觉对齐提供了原则性、骨干无关和优化器无关的解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in medical image analysis, largely due to the prohibitively high-dimensional deformation space of dense displacement fields and the scarcity of voxel-level supervision. Existing reinforcement learning frameworks often project this space into coarse, low-dimensional representations, limiting their ability to capture spatially variant deformations. We propose MorphSeek, a fine-grained representation-level policy optimization paradigm that reformulates DIR as a spatially continuous optimization process in the latent feature space. MorphSeek introduces a stochastic Gaussian policy head atop the encoder to model a distribution over latent features, facilitating efficient exploration and coarse-to-fine refinement. The framework integrates unsupervised warm-up with weakly supervised fine-tuning through Group Relative Policy Optimization, where multi-trajectory sampling stabilizes training and improves label efficiency. Across three 3D registration benchmarks (OASIS brain MRI, LiTS liver CT, and Abdomen MR-CT), MorphSeek achieves consistent Dice improvements over competitive baselines while maintaining high label efficiency with minimal parameter cost and low step-level latency overhead. Beyond optimizer specifics, MorphSeek advances a representation-level policy learning paradigm that achieves spatially coherent and data-efficient deformation optimization, offering a principled, backbone-agnostic, and optimizer-agnostic solution for scalable visual alignment in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Face verification is a significant component of identity authentication in various applications including online banking and secure access to personal devices. The majority of the existing face image datasets often suffer from notable biases related to race, gender, and other demographic characteristics, limiting the effectiveness and fairness of face verification systems. In response to these challenges, we propose a comprehensive methodology that integrates advanced generative models to create varied and diverse high-quality synthetic face images. This methodology emphasizes the representation of a diverse range of facial traits, ensuring adherence to characteristics permissible in identity card photographs. Furthermore, we introduce the Diverse and Inclusive Faces for Verification (DIF-V) dataset, comprising 27,780 images of 926 unique identities, designed as a benchmark for future research in face verification. Our analysis reveals that existing verification models exhibit biases toward certain genders and races, and notably, applying identity style modifications negatively impacts model performance. By tackling the inherent inequities in existing datasets, this work not only enriches the discussion on diversity and ethics in artificial intelligence but also lays the foundation for developing more inclusive and reliable face verification technologies

Result: 在三个公共AQA基准测试中，MCMoE在完整和不完整多模态学习中都达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: MCMoE框架有效解决了多模态AQA中的模态缺失问题，实现了鲁棒的多模态动作质量评估。

Abstract: Multimodal Action Quality Assessment (AQA) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm. By leveraging complementary information across shared contextual cues, it enhances the discriminative evaluation of subtle intra-class variations in highly similar action sequences. However, partial modalities are frequently unavailable at the inference stage in reality. The absence of any modality often renders existing multimodal models inoperable. Furthermore, it triggers catastrophic performance degradation due to interruptions in cross-modal interactions. To address this issue, we propose a novel Missing Completion Framework with Mixture of Experts (MCMoE) that unifies unimodal and joint representation learning in single-stage training. Specifically, we propose an adaptive gated modality generator that dynamically fuses available information to reconstruct missing modalities. We then design modality experts to learn unimodal knowledge and dynamically mix the knowledge of all experts to extract cross-modal joint representations. With a mixture of experts, missing modalities are further refined and complemented. Finally, in the training phase, we mine the complete multimodal features and unimodal expert knowledge to guide modality generation and generation-based joint representation extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MCMoE achieves state-of-the-art results in both complete and incomplete multimodal learning on three public AQA benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理多通道图像时独立处理每个通道，导致注意力计算呈二次增长，计算成本过高。需要解决跨通道注意力的效率问题。

Method: 将每个通道视为专家，使用轻量级路由器为每个图像块选择最相关的通道专家进行注意力计算，避免不必要的通道间交互。

Conclusion: MoE-ViT为多通道成像提供了一个实用且高效的骨干网络，证明了并非所有通道交互都需要建模。

Abstract: Vision Transformers ($\text{ViTs}$) have become the backbone of vision foundation models, yet their optimization for multi-channel domains - such as cell painting or satellite imagery - remains underexplored. A key challenge in these domains is capturing interactions between channels, as each channel carries different information. While existing works have shown efficacy by treating each channel independently during tokenization, this approach naturally introduces a major computational bottleneck in the attention block - channel-wise comparisons leads to a quadratic growth in attention, resulting in excessive $\text{FLOPs}$ and high training cost. In this work, we shift focus from efficacy to the overlooked efficiency challenge in cross-channel attention and ask: "Is it necessary to model all channel interactions?". Inspired by the philosophy of Sparse Mixture-of-Experts ($\text{MoE}$), we propose MoE-ViT, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for multi-channel images in $\text{ViTs}$, which treats each channel as an expert and employs a lightweight router to select only the most relevant experts per patch for attention. Proof-of-concept experiments on real-world datasets - JUMP-CP and So2Sat - demonstrate that $\text{MoE-ViT}$ achieves substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing, and in some cases enhancing, performance, making it a practical and attractive backbone for multi-channel imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易学习训练数据中虚假相关的捷径特征，在医学图像分析等高风险应用中，这可能导致模型不使用临床相关特征进行预测，影响鲁棒性并对患者造成危害。

Method: 利用在小型任务相关数据上微调的教师网络进行知识蒸馏，针对性地缓解学生网络中的捷径学习。通过分析不同类型捷径在网络各层的表现，设计针对中间层的缓解策略。

Result: 在CheXpert、ISIC 2017和SimBA数据集上使用多种架构进行实验，相比传统经验风险最小化、基于增强和基于组的偏差缓解方法，均取得一致改进。在多数情况下，性能可与在无偏差数据上训练的基线模型相媲美，包括在分布外测试数据上。

Conclusion: 该方法在医学成像场景中具有实际应用价值，特别是在偏差标注有限且捷径特征难以预先识别的情况下。

Abstract: Deep learning models are prone to learning shortcut solutions to problems using spuriously correlated yet irrelevant features of their training data. In high-risk applications such as medical image analysis, this phenomenon may prevent models from using clinically meaningful features when making predictions, potentially leading to poor robustness and harm to patients. We demonstrate that different types of shortcuts (those that are diffuse and spread throughout the image, as well as those that are localized to specific areas) manifest distinctly across network layers and can, therefore, be more effectively targeted through mitigation strategies that target the intermediate layers. We propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages a teacher network fine-tuned on a small subset of task-relevant data to mitigate shortcut learning in a student network trained on a large dataset corrupted with a bias feature. Through extensive experiments on CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets using various architectures (ResNet-18, AlexNet, DenseNet-121, and 3D CNNs), we demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional Empirical Risk Minimization, augmentation-based bias-mitigation, and group-based bias-mitigation approaches. In many cases, we achieve comparable performance with a baseline model trained on bias-free data, even on out-of-distribution test data. Our results demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach to real-world medical imaging scenarios where bias annotations are limited and shortcut features are difficult to identify a priori.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are increasingly used in remote sensing (RS) for tasks such as environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and land-use mapping. These models include unimodal vision encoders trained on a single data modality and multimodal architectures trained on combinations of SAR, multispectral, hyperspectral, and image-text data. They support diverse RS tasks including semantic segmentation, image classification, change detection, and visual question answering. However, selecting an appropriate remote sensing foundation model (RSFM) remains difficult due to scattered documentation, heterogeneous formats, and varied deployment constraints. We introduce the RSFM Database (RS-FMD), a structured resource covering over 150 RSFMs spanning multiple data modalities, resolutions, and learning paradigms. Built on RS-FMD, we present REMSA, the first LLM-based agent for automated RSFM selection from natural language queries. REMSA interprets user requirements, resolves missing constraints, ranks candidate models using in-context learning, and provides transparent justifications. We also propose a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios, producing 900 configurations under an expert-centered evaluation protocol. REMSA outperforms several baselines, including naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs. It operates entirely on publicly available metadata and does not access private or sensitive data.

Conclusion: MMT-ARD框架能有效提升多模态大模型的对抗鲁棒性，具有显著的效果和可扩展性

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, making their adversarial robustness a crucial concern. While adversarial knowledge distillation has shown promise in transferring robustness from teacher to student models, traditional single-teacher approaches suffer from limited knowledge diversity, slow convergence, and difficulty in balancing robustness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose MMT-ARD: a Multimodal Multi-Teacher Adversarial Robust Distillation framework. Our key innovation is a dual-teacher knowledge fusion architecture that collaboratively optimizes clean feature preservation and robust feature enhancement. To better handle challenging adversarial examples, we introduce a dynamic weight allocation strategy based on teacher confidence, enabling adaptive focus on harder samples. Moreover, to mitigate bias among teachers, we design an adaptive sigmoid-based weighting function that balances the strength of knowledge transfer across modalities. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that MMT-ARD improves robust accuracy by +4.32% and zero-shot accuracy by +3.5% on the ViT-B-32 model, while achieving a 2.3x increase in training efficiency over traditional single-teacher methods. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of MMT-ARD in enhancing the adversarial robustness of multimodal large models.

Conclusion: 通过将深度从物理量重新定义为创作抽象，Illustrator's Depth预测为可编辑图像分解提供了新基础。

Abstract: We introduce Illustrator's Depth, a novel definition of depth that addresses a key challenge in digital content creation: decomposing flat images into editable, ordered layers. Inspired by an artist's compositional process, illustrator's depth infers a layer index to each pixel, forming an interpretable image decomposition through a discrete, globally consistent ordering of elements optimized for editability. We also propose and train a neural network using a curated dataset of layered vector graphics to predict layering directly from raster inputs. Our layer index inference unlocks a range of powerful downstream applications. In particular, it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for image vectorization while also enabling high-fidelity text-to-vector-graphics generation, automatic 3D relief generation from 2D images, and intuitive depth-aware editing. By reframing depth from a physical quantity to a creative abstraction, illustrator's depth prediction offers a new foundation for editable image decomposition.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation networks trained under full supervision for one type of lidar fail to generalize to unseen lidars without intervention. To reduce the performance gap under domain shifts, a recent trend is to leverage vision foundation models (VFMs) providing robust features across domains. In this work, we conduct an exhaustive study to identify recipes for exploiting VFMs in unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation of lidar point clouds. Building upon unsupervised image-to-lidar knowledge distillation, our study reveals that: (1) the architecture of the lidar backbone is key to maximize the generalization performance on a target domain; (2) it is possible to pretrain a single backbone once and for all, and use it to address many domain shifts; (3) best results are obtained by keeping the pretrained backbone frozen and training an MLP head for semantic segmentation. The resulting pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results in four widely-recognized and challenging settings. The code will be available at: https://github.com/valeoai/muddos.

Conclusion: 所提出的神经网络方法能够有效利用GPR B-scan图像的相似性和差异特征，在恶劣环境条件下实现更精确的距离估计，为机器人/车辆定位提供了改进方案。

Abstract: When performing robot/vehicle localization using ground penetrating radar (GPR) to handle adverse weather and environmental conditions, existing techniques often struggle to accurately estimate distances when processing B-scan images with minor distinctions. This study introduces a new neural network-based odometry method that leverages the similarity and difference features of GPR B-scan images for precise estimation of the Euclidean distances traveled between the B-scan images. The new custom neural network extracts multi-scale features from B-scan images taken at consecutive moments and then determines the Euclidean distance traveled by analyzing the similarities and differences between these features. To evaluate our method, an ablation study and comparison experiments have been conducted using the publicly available CMU-GPR dataset. The experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts in all tests. Specifically, our method achieves a root mean square error (RMSE), and achieves an overall weighted RMSE of 0.449 m across all data sets, which is a 10.2\% reduction in RMSE when compared to the best state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: CWMDT是一个将标准视频扩散模型转化为反事实世界模型的框架，通过构建场景的数字孪生、使用大语言模型推理干预效果，并生成反事实视觉序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型主要关注基于事实观测的前向模拟，但对于评估AI在不同条件下的物理行为等新兴应用，需要能够回答反事实查询（如"如果移除这个物体会发生什么？"）的能力。

Method: 1. 构建观察场景的数字孪生，以结构化文本编码对象及其关系；2. 使用大语言模型推理反事实干预如何随时间传播改变观察场景；3. 用修改后的表示条件化视频扩散模型来生成反事实视觉序列。

Result: 在两个基准测试上的评估表明，CWMDT方法实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 视频的替代表示（如数字孪生）为基于视频前向模拟的世界模型提供了强大的控制信号。

Abstract: World models learn to predict the temporal evolution of visual observations given a control signal, potentially enabling agents to reason about environments through forward simulation. Because of the focus on forward simulation, current world models generate predictions based on factual observations. For many emerging applications, such as comprehensive evaluations of physical AI behavior under varying conditions, the ability of world models to answer counterfactual queries, such as "what would happen if this object was removed?", is of increasing importance. We formalize counterfactual world models that additionally take interventions as explicit inputs, predicting temporal sequences under hypothetical modifications to observed scene properties. Traditional world models operate directly on entangled pixel-space representations where object properties and relationships cannot be selectively modified. This modeling choice prevents targeted interventions on specific scene properties. We introduce CWMDT, a framework to overcome those limitations, turning standard video diffusion models into effective counterfactual world models. First, CWMDT constructs digital twins of observed scenes to explicitly encode objects and their relationships, represented as structured text. Second, CWMDT applies large language models to reason over these representations and predict how a counterfactual intervention propagates through time to alter the observed scene. Third, CWMDT conditions a video diffusion model with the modified representation to generate counterfactual visual sequences. Evaluations on two benchmarks show that the CWMDT approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, suggesting that alternative representations of videos, such as the digital twins considered here, offer powerful control signals for video forward simulation-based world models.

Conclusion: 该方法为高频雷达领域的3D重建提供了有效解决方案，并发布了两个合成基准数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Determining the shape of 3D objects from high-frequency radar signals is analytically complex but critical for commercial and aerospace applications. Previous deep learning methods have been applied to radar modeling; however, they often fail to represent arbitrary shapes or have difficulty with real-world radar signals which are collected over limited viewing angles. Existing methods in optical 3D reconstruction can generate arbitrary shapes from limited camera views, but struggle when they naively treat the radar signal as a camera view. In this work, we present Radar2Shape, a denoising diffusion model that handles a partially observable radar signal for 3D reconstruction by correlating its frequencies with multiresolution shape features. Our method consists of a two-stage approach: first, Radar2Shape learns a regularized latent space with hierarchical resolutions of shape features, and second, it diffuses into this latent space by conditioning on the frequencies of the radar signal in an analogous coarse-to-fine manner. We demonstrate that Radar2Shape can successfully reconstruct arbitrary 3D shapes even from partially-observed radar signals, and we show robust generalization to two different simulation methods and real-world data. Additionally, we release two synthetic benchmark datasets to encourage future research in the high-frequency radar domain so that models like Radar2Shape can safely be adapted into real-world radar systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脊柱是复杂的结构，容易发生与年龄相关的退行性变化，这些变化可以通过MRI识别。需要开发一种方法来量化脊柱健康状态。

Method: 使用UMAP和HDBSCAN进行年龄聚类分析，构建深度学习模型估计脊柱年龄，通过消融研究确定最佳模型配置。

Result: 脊柱年龄差距（SAG）与椎间盘突出、骨赘、椎管狭窄、骨折等退行性疾病，以及吸烟和体力劳动等生活方式因素显著相关。

Conclusion: 脊柱年龄差距可作为衡量整体脊柱健康的有用生物标志物，具有临床实用性。

Abstract: The human spine is a complex structure composed of 33 vertebrae. It holds the body and is important for leading a healthy life. The spine is vulnerable to age-related degenerations that can be identified through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this paper we propose a novel computer-vison-based deep learning method to estimate spine age using images from over 18,000 MRI series. Data are restricted to subjects with only age-related spine degeneration. Eligibility criteria are created by identifying common age-based clusters of degenerative spine conditions using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN). Model selection is determined using a detailed ablation study on data size, loss, and the effect of different spine regions. We evaluate the clinical utility of our model by calculating the difference between actual spine age and model-predicted age, the spine age gap (SAG), and examining the association between these differences and spine degenerative conditions and lifestyle factors. We find that SAG is associated with conditions including disc bulges, disc osteophytes, spinal stenosis, and fractures, as well as lifestyle factors like smoking and physically demanding work, and thus may be a useful biomarker for measuring overall spine health.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用需要更小、更高效的多模态系统，但LLM降尺度会不成比例地影响视觉能力而非继承自LLM的能力，这成为性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出Extract+Think方法：1）视觉提取调优，训练模型一致地提取任务相关的视觉细节；2）基于提取的视觉细节进行逐步推理生成答案。

Result: LLM降尺度对感知能力的影响与推理能力相当甚至更大，而Extract+Think方法在该领域设定了效率和性能的新标准。

Conclusion: 通过专门解决视觉感知瓶颈的Extract+Think方法，可以在多模态模型降尺度时保持更好的性能，为高效多模态系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling up multimodal models has enabled remarkable advances in visual understanding and reasoning, but practical demands call for smaller, efficient systems. In this work, we conduct a principled analysis of downscaling intelligence in multimodal models, examining how reduced large language model (LLM) capacity affects multimodal capabilities. Our initial findings reveal an interesting trend: LLM downscaling disproportionately affects visual capabilities, rather than abilities inherited from the LLM. We then examine whether this drop mainly reflects the expected decline in visual reasoning or a more fundamental loss of perceptual abilities. Isolating the effect of LLM downscaling on perception, we find performance still drops sharply, often matching or exceeding the impact on reasoning. To address this bottleneck, we introduce visual extraction tuning, which explicitly trains the model to extract instruction-relevant visual details consistently across tasks. With these extracted visual details, we then apply step-by-step reasoning to generate answers. Together, these components form our Extract+Think approach, setting a new standard for efficiency and performance in this space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频QA模型依赖单次感知固定帧，导致在细粒度证据上产生幻觉和失败，而人类会暂停、放大和重读关键区域。

Method: 提出视觉反刍机制：迭代选择帧、放大信息区域、重新编码检索像素、更新推理状态；构建两个数据集用于监督实践和强化学习；采用多阶段反刍学习框架，通过SFT和GRPO-based RL逐步微调7B LMM。

Result: Video-R4-7B在M4-ViteVQA上达到最先进结果，并能泛化到多页文档QA、幻灯片QA和通用视频QA任务。

Conclusion: 迭代反刍是像素基础多模态推理的有效范式。

Abstract: Understanding text-rich videos requires reading small, transient textual cues that often demand repeated inspection. Yet most video QA models rely on single-pass perception over fixed frames, leading to hallucinations and failures on fine-grained evidence. Inspired by how humans pause, zoom, and re-read critical regions, we introduce Video-R4 (Reinforcing Text-Rich Video Reasoning with Visual Rumination), a video reasoning LMM that performs visual rumination: iteratively selecting frames, zooming into informative regions, re-encoding retrieved pixels, and updating its reasoning state. We construct two datasets with executable rumination trajectories: Video-R4-CoT-17k for supervised practice and Video-R4-RL-30k for reinforcement learning. We propose a multi-stage rumination learning framework that progressively finetunes a 7B LMM to learn atomic and mixing visual operations via SFT and GRPO-based RL. Video-R4-7B achieves state-of-the-art results on M4-ViteVQA and further generalizes to multi-page document QA, slides QA, and generic video QA, demonstrating that iterative rumination is an effective paradigm for pixel-grounded multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 传统方法直接将事件映射到强度图像，但存在感知质量差、模型容量和训练数据难以扩展的问题，且事件到图像的转换是高度不适定问题。

Method: 设计基于事件的扩散模型，仅执行单次前向扩散步骤，配备时间一致的EvEncoder，并使用新颖的替代训练框架消除对配对事件-图像数据集的依赖。

Conclusion: EvDiff在事件到视频重建任务中找到了保真度和真实感的最佳平衡点，为事件相机应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: As neuromorphic sensors, event cameras asynchronously record changes in brightness as streams of sparse events with the advantages of high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Reconstructing intensity images from events is a highly ill-posed task due to the inherent ambiguity of absolute brightness. Early methods generally follow an end-to-end regression paradigm, directly mapping events to intensity frames in a deterministic manner. While effective to some extent, these approaches often yield perceptually inferior results and struggle to scale up in model capacity and training data. In this work, we propose EvDiff, an event-based diffusion model that follows a surrogate training framework to produce high-quality videos. To reduce the heavy computational cost of high-frame-rate video generation, we design an event-based diffusion model that performs only a single forward diffusion step, equipped with a temporally consistent EvEncoder. Furthermore, our novel Surrogate Training Framework eliminates the dependence on paired event-image datasets, allowing the model to leverage large-scale image datasets for higher capacity. The proposed EvDiff is capable of generating high-quality colorful videos solely from monochromatic event streams. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method strikes a sweet spot between fidelity and realism, outperforming existing approaches on both pixel-level and perceptual metrics.

Conclusion: 提出的原生3D编辑框架为3D内容创作提供了高效且高质量的解决方案，在多个关键指标上设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Instruction-guided 3D editing is a rapidly emerging field with the potential to broaden access to 3D content creation. However, existing methods face critical limitations: optimization-based approaches are prohibitively slow, while feed-forward approaches relying on multi-view 2D editing often suffer from inconsistent geometry and degraded visual quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel native 3D editing framework that directly manipulates 3D representations in a single, efficient feed-forward pass. Specifically, we create a large-scale, multi-modal dataset for instruction-guided 3D editing, covering diverse addition, deletion, and modification tasks. This dataset is meticulously curated to ensure that edited objects faithfully adhere to the instructional changes while preserving the consistency of unedited regions with the source object. Building upon this dataset, we explore two distinct conditioning strategies for our model: a conventional cross-attention mechanism and a novel 3D token concatenation approach. Our results demonstrate that token concatenation is more parameter-efficient and achieves superior performance. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms existing 2D-lifting approaches, setting a new benchmark in generation quality, 3D consistency, and instruction fidelity.

Method: 提出MicroEP并行化策略，通过跨GPU的高效token调度实现每个微批次的最优负载平衡。并构建了MicroMoE分布式MoE训练系统。

Result: MicroMoE相比最先进系统将端到端训练吞吐量提高了47.6%，几乎始终在GPU间实现最优负载平衡。

Conclusion: MicroEP策略和MicroMoE系统有效解决了MoE训练中的负载不平衡问题，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising approach to scale up deep learning models due to its significant reduction in computational resources. However, the dynamic nature of MoE leads to load imbalance among experts, severely impacting training efficiency. While previous research has attempted to address the load balancing challenge, existing solutions either compromise model accuracy or introduce additional system overhead. As a result, they fail to achieve fine-grained load balancing, which is crucial to optimizing training efficiency.
  We propose MicroEP, a novel parallelization strategy to achieve fine-grained load balancing in MoE systems. MicroEP is capable of achieving optimal load balancing in every micro-batch through efficient token scheduling across GPUs. Furthermore, we propose MicroMoE, an efficient distributed MoE training system with MicroEP's load balancing capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that MicroMoE improves the end-to-end training throughput by up to 47.6% compared with the state-of-the-art system, and almost consistently achieves optimal load balance among GPUs.

Conclusion: 性能异常检测器的精度和召回率需求取决于检测频率，高精度和高召回率并非总是必要，应根据检测频率优化检测器特性。

Abstract: Detecting and resolving performance anomalies in Cloud services is crucial for maintaining desired performance objectives. Scaling actions triggered by an anomaly detector help achieve target latency at the cost of extra resource consumption. However, performance anomaly detectors make mistakes. This paper studies which characteristics of performance anomaly detection are important to optimize the trade-off between performance and cost. Using Stochastic Reward Nets, we model a Cloud service monitored by a performance anomaly detector. Using our model, we study the impact of detector characteristics, namely precision, recall and inspection frequency, on the average latency and resource consumption of the monitored service. Our results show that achieving a high precision and a high recall is not always necessary. If detection can be run frequently, a high precision is enough to obtain a good performance-to-cost trade-off, but if the detector is run infrequently, recall becomes the most important.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a foundational technique for real-time neural rendering, 3D scene generation, volumetric video (4D) capture. However, its rendering and training impose massive computation, making real-time rendering on edge devices and real-time 4D reconstruction on workstations currently infeasible. Given its fixed-function nature and similarity with traditional rasterization, 3DGS presents a strong case for dedicated hardware in the graphics pipeline of next-generation GPUs. This work, Vorion, presents the first GPGPU prototype with hardware-accelerated 3DGS rendering and training. Vorion features scalable architecture, minimal hardware change to traditional rasterizers, z-tiling to increase parallelism, and Gaussian/pixel-centric hybrid dataflow. We prototype the minimal system (8 SIMT cores, 2 Gaussian rasterizer) using TSMC 16nm FinFET technology, which achieves 19 FPS for rendering. The scaled design with 16 rasterizers achieves 38.6 iterations/s for training.

Abstract: Systolic array accelerators execute CNNs with energy dominated by the switching activity of multiply accumulate (MAC) units. Although prior work exploits weight dependent MAC power for compression, existing methods often use global activation models, coarse energy proxies, or layer-agnostic policies, which limits their effectiveness on real hardware. We propose an energy aware, layer-wise compression framework that explicitly leverages MAC and layer level energy characteristics. First, we build a layer-aware MAC energy model that combines per-layer activation statistics with an MSB-Hamming distance grouping of 22-bit partial sum transitions, and integrate it with a tile-level systolic mapping to estimate convolution-layer energy. On top of this model, we introduce an energy accuracy co-optimized weight selection algorithm within quantization aware training and an energy-prioritized layer-wise schedule that compresses high energy layers more aggressively under a global accuracy constraint. Experiments on different CNN models demonstrate up to 58.6\% energy reduction with 2-3\% accuracy drop, outperforming a state-of-the-art power-aware baseline.

Abstract: Nowadays, we are witnessing an Artificial Intelligence revolution that dominates the technology landscape in various application domains, such as healthcare, robotics, automotive, security, and defense. Massive-scale AI models, which mimic the human brain's functionality, typically feature millions and even billions of parameters through data-intensive matrix multiplication tasks. While conventional Von-Neumann architectures struggle with the memory wall and the end of Moore's Law, these AI applications are migrating rapidly towards the edge, such as in robotics and unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance, thereby adding more constraints to the hardware budget of AI architectures at the edge. Although in-memory computing has been proposed as a promising solution for the memory wall, both analog and digital in-memory computing architectures suffer from substantial degradation of the proposed benefits due to various design limitations. We propose a new digital in-memory stochastic computing architecture, DISCA, utilizing a compressed version of the quasi-stochastic Bent-Pyramid data format. DISCA inherits the same computational simplicity of analog computing, while preserving the same scalability, productivity, and reliability of digital systems. Post-layout modeling results of DISCA show an energy efficiency of 3.59 TOPS/W per bit at 500 MHz using a commercial 180nm CMOS technology. Therefore, DISCA significantly improves the energy efficiency for matrix multiplication workloads by orders of magnitude if scaled and compared to its counterpart architectures.

Abstract: Memristive in-memory computing (IMC) has emerged as a promising solution for addressing the bottleneck in the Von Neumann architecture.

Result: 在YouCook2语料库上的实验表明，确认生成的准确性是动作规划性能的主要因素；长上下文Q-former通过整合VideoLLaMA3提高了确认和动作规划的性能。

Conclusion: 长上下文Q-former方法有效改进了人机交互中的动作确认和规划，证明了利用完整视频上下文信息的重要性。

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration towards a shared goal requires robots to understand human action and interaction with the surrounding environment. This paper focuses on human-robot interaction (HRI) based on human-robot dialogue that relies on the robot action confirmation and action step generation using multimodal scene understanding. The state-of-the-art approach uses multimodal transformers to generate robot action steps aligned with robot action confirmation from a single clip showing a task composed of multiple micro steps. Although actions towards a long-horizon task depend on each other throughout an entire video, the current approaches mainly focus on clip-level processing and do not leverage long-context information. This paper proposes a long-context Q-former incorporating left and right context dependency in full videos. Furthermore, this paper proposes a text-conditioning approach to feed text embeddings directly into the LLM decoder to mitigate the high abstraction of the information in text by Q-former. Experiments with the YouCook2 corpus show that the accuracy of confirmation generation is a major factor in the performance of action planning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the long-context Q-former improves the confirmation and action planning by integrating VideoLLaMA3.

Abstract: Dense 3D semantic occupancy perception is critical for mobile robots operating in pedestrian-rich environments, yet it remains underexplored compared to its application in autonomous driving. To address this gap, we present MobileOcc, a semantic occupancy dataset for mobile robots operating in crowded human environments. Our dataset is built using an annotation pipeline that incorporates static object occupancy annotations and a novel mesh optimization framework explicitly designed for human occupancy modeling. It reconstructs deformable human geometry from 2D images and subsequently refines and optimizes it using associated LiDAR point data. Using MobileOcc, we establish benchmarks for two tasks, i) Occupancy prediction and ii) Pedestrian velocity prediction, using different methods including monocular, stereo, and panoptic occupancy, with metrics and baseline implementations for reproducible comparison. Beyond occupancy prediction, we further assess our annotation method on 3D human pose estimation datasets. Results demonstrate that our method exhibits robust performance across different datasets.

Conclusion: 提出的TP-MDDN基准和AWMSystem系统有效解决了多需求偏好导航问题，为复杂环境下的长程导航任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In daily life, people often move through spaces to find objects that meet their needs, posing a key challenge in embodied AI. Traditional Demand-Driven Navigation (DDN) handles one need at a time but does not reflect the complexity of real-world tasks involving multiple needs and personal choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task-Preferenced Multi-Demand-Driven Navigation (TP-MDDN), a new benchmark for long-horizon navigation involving multiple sub-demands with explicit task preferences. To solve TP-MDDN, we propose AWMSystem, an autonomous decision-making system composed of three key modules: BreakLLM (instruction decomposition), LocateLLM (goal selection), and StatusMLLM (task monitoring). For spatial memory, we design MASMap, which combines 3D point cloud accumulation with 2D semantic mapping for accurate and efficient environmental understanding. Our Dual-Tempo action generation framework integrates zero-shot planning with policy-based fine control, and is further supported by an Adaptive Error Corrector that handles failure cases in real time. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both perception accuracy and navigation robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆运动学技术需要基于指尖位姿进行后验决策或数值近似，难以处理复杂运动学问题。本文旨在通过机器学习隐式克服这些挑战。

Method: 使用条件变分自编码器(CVAE)，以关键结构元素的点云数据作为输入，重建相应的关节配置。

Result: 在MultiDex抓取数据集上使用Allegro Hand验证，运行时间在0.05毫秒内，精度与最先进方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在AI驱动的抓取规划技术中展示了关节配置估计的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents an efficient approach for determining the joint configuration of a multifingered gripper solely from the point cloud data of its poly-articulated chain, as generated by visual sensors, simulations or even generative neural networks. Well-known inverse kinematics (IK) techniques can provide mathematically exact solutions (when they exist) for joint configuration determination based solely on the fingertip pose, but often require post-hoc decision-making by considering the positions of all intermediate phalanges in the gripper's fingers, or rely on algorithms to numerically approximate solutions for more complex kinematics. In contrast, our method leverages machine learning to implicitly overcome these challenges. This is achieved through a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE), which takes point cloud data of key structural elements as input and reconstructs the corresponding joint configurations. We validate our approach on the MultiDex grasping dataset using the Allegro Hand, operating within 0.05 milliseconds and achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. This highlights the effectiveness of our pipeline for joint configuration estimation within the broader context of AI-driven techniques for grasp planning.

Motivation: 构建能够跨任务感知、推理和行动的通用机器人仍具挑战性，特别是灵巧操作领域。主要瓶颈在于缺乏大规模、动作标注的灵巧技能数据，而人类数据提供了丰富的先验知识。

Method: 构建EgoAtlas数据集整合多源人类和机器人数据，提取紧凑离散的运动感知动态表示，并开发METIS模型将推理和行动统一到一个框架中。

Conclusion: METIS是迈向灵巧操作通用模型的有希望的一步，证明了整合多源数据和统一推理-行动框架的有效性。

Abstract: Building a generalist robot that can perceive, reason, and act across diverse tasks remains an open challenge, especially for dexterous manipulation. A major bottleneck lies in the scarcity of large-scale, action-annotated data for dexterous skills, as teleoperation is difficult and costly. Human data, with its vast scale and diverse manipulation behaviors, provides rich priors for learning robotic actions. While prior works have explored leveraging human demonstrations, they are often constrained by limited scenarios and a large visual gap between human and robots. To eliminate these limitations, we propose METIS, a vision-language-action (VLA) model for dexterous manipulation pretrained on multi-source egocentric datasets. We first construct EgoAtlas, which integrates large-scale human and robotic data from multiple sources, all unified under a consistent action space. We further extract motion-aware dynamics, a compact and discretized motion representation, which provides efficient and expressive supervision for VLA training. Built upon them, METIS integrates reasoning and acting into a unified framework, enabling effective deployment to downstream dexterous manipulation tasks. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving highest average success rate in six real-world tasks. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings emphasize METIS as a promising step toward a generalist model for dexterous manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注静态家庭环境，无法评估VLLM在动态、复杂现实环境中的整体性能，需要填补动态工业导航评估的空白。

Method: 使用12个高保真Unity仓库场景，结合PointGoal导航管道，将自我中心视觉与全局里程计结合，评估局部-全局规划能力，并引入碰撞率和警告率指标。

Result: 对9个最先进VLLM的评估显示，闭源模型保持优势，但所有智能体在稳健路径规划、碰撞避免和主动探索方面都存在明显缺陷。

Conclusion: 具身研究需要超越被动感知，转向需要稳定规划、主动探索和在动态现实环境中安全行为的任务。

Abstract: While Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs) show great promise as embodied agents, they continue to face substantial challenges in spatial reasoning. Existing embodied benchmarks largely focus on passive, static household environments and evaluate only isolated capabilities, failing to capture holistic performance in dynamic, real-world complexity. To fill this gap, we present IndustryNav, the first dynamic industrial navigation benchmark for active spatial reasoning. IndustryNav leverages 12 manually created, high-fidelity Unity warehouse scenarios featuring dynamic objects and human movement. Our evaluation employs a PointGoal navigation pipeline that effectively combines egocentric vision with global odometry to assess holistic local-global planning. Crucially, we introduce the "collision rate" and "warning rate" metrics to measure safety-oriented behaviors and distance estimation. A comprehensive study of nine state-of-the-art VLLMs (including models such as GPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5, and Gemini-2.5) reveals that closed-source models maintain a consistent advantage; however, all agents exhibit notable deficiencies in robust path planning, collision avoidance and active exploration. This highlights a critical need for embodied research to move beyond passive perception and toward tasks that demand stable planning, active exploration, and safe behavior in dynamic, real-world environment.

Abstract: Maximizing performance on available GPU hardware is an ongoing challenge for modern AI inference systems. Traditional approaches include writing custom GPU kernels and using specialized model compilers to tune high-level code for specific GPU targets. Recent work shows that LLM-based multi-agent systems can effectively perform such tuning, often outperforming existing compilers and eliminating the need for manual kernel development. However, the dynamics of multi-agent systems for this task remain unexplored. In this work, we present a logical framework for comparing multi-agent PyTorch optimization systems. Our evaluation shows that exploit-heavy strategies perform best when paired with error-fixing agents, and that performance correlates with the granularity of optimization steps. The best implementation achieves an average 2.88x speedup on an H100 GPU across diverse tasks in KernelBench, a benchmark suite covering a range of machine learning architectures in PyTorch.

TL;DR: 提出几何解缠遗忘方法(GU)，通过将遗忘梯度分解为与保留梯度空间正交的分量，在保证遗忘效果的同时最小化对保留知识的影响


<details>

Motivation: 机器遗忘中，遗忘样本的梯度上升往往会损害保留知识，现有方法在有效遗忘和保留知识保护之间存在权衡，缺乏对遗忘更新如何影响保留知识的理论分析

Method: 基于一阶分析，将遗忘梯度更新分解为保留梯度空间的切向分量和法向分量，只执行法向分量以实现保留不变性，在信任区域预算下推导最优投影方向

Result: GU方法在TOFU、MUSE和WMDP三个基准测试中，对各种基于梯度的遗忘方法都实现了持续改进

Conclusion: 几何解缠遗忘方法提供了一种理论上有保证的简单解决方案，能够有效缓解遗忘过程中的副作用，同时保持遗忘效果

Abstract: Machine unlearning, the removal of a training subset's influence from a deployed model, is critical for privacy preservation and model reliability, yet gradient ascent on forget samples often harms retained knowledge. Existing approaches face a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation on the retain set. While previous methods provide useful heuristics, they often lack a formal analysis on how exactly forgetting updates harm retained knowledge, and whether the side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees. To explore a theoretically sound and simple solution, we start from the first principle on how performance on the retain set is actually affected: a first-order analysis of the local change of the retain loss under small parameter updates during model training. We start from a crisp equivalence: the retain loss is unchanged to first order iff the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients ("retain-invariant"). This identifies the entangled component as the tangential part of forget update within the retain-gradient subspace, and characterizes disentanglement as orthogonality. Guided by this, we propose the Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) that decomposes any candidate forget gradient update into tangential and normal components to retain space and executes only the normal component. Under a standard trust-region budget, the projected direction aligned with the raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves, and we also derive the optimal projected direction for joint forget-retain updating objectives. Our method is plug-and-play and can be attached to existing gradient-based unlearning procedures to mitigate side effects. GU achieves consistent improvement on various methods across three benchmarks TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP.

TL;DR: FlashCache是一个基于频域分析和异常KV感知的多模态KV缓存压缩框架，通过保留偏离主能量的异常KV对，在保持任务性能的同时显著降低KV内存使用并加速解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在显著推理开销，因为多模态KV缓存随视觉输入长度增长而增加。现有压缩方法依赖注意力分数，与高效注意力内核不兼容且忽略值向量对注意力输出的贡献。

Method: 从KV矩阵分布角度分析，发现多模态KV矩阵频域能量集中在低频，提取主能量；识别偏离主能量的异常KV；提出FlashCache框架，包含异常KV识别模块和动态预算分配模块。

Result: 在多个MLLM和基准测试中，FlashCache优于最先进的多模态KV压缩方法，实现高达1.69倍解码加速和80% KV内存使用降低，同时保持任务性能。

Conclusion: FlashCache通过频域引导的异常KV感知压缩，有效解决了多模态KV缓存的内存和计算开销问题，为多模态大语言模型的高效推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models suffer from substantial inference overhead since multimodal KV Cache grows proportionally with the visual input length. Existing multimodal KV Cache compression methods mostly rely on attention score to reduce cache size, which makes them are incompatible with established efficient attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) and ignores the contribution of value vectors to the attention output. In this work, we revisit multimodal KV Cache compression from the perspective of the KV matrices' distribution. First, we observe that frequency-domain energy of multimodal KV matrices is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency and extract this principal energy via a low-pass filter. Further, we find that removing KV pairs that deviate substantially from this principal energy leads to a pronounced performance drop, which we define as Outlier KVs. Considering Outlier KVs are more likely to encode features critical for inference, we propose FlashCache, a frequency-domain-guided, Outlier-KV-aware KV Cache compression framework. First, we introduce an Outlier KV Recognition Module that models the principal component of multimodal KV matrices in the frequency domain and preferentially retains KV pairs that significantly deviate from it. Furthermore, Dynamic Budget Allocation Module is designed to adaptively determine the per-layer KV Cache size to retain more Outlier KVs. Experiments on multiple MLLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that FlashCache outperforms state-of-the-art multimoal KV compression methods, achieving up to 1.69 times faster decoding with 80% lower KV memory usage while maintaining task performance.

Conclusion: 验证了扩散推理的计算受限特性，为可持续AI部署规划和碳足迹估算提供了基础。

Abstract: The rapidly growing computational demands of diffusion models for image generation have raised significant concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. While existing approaches to energy optimization focus on architectural improvements or hardware acceleration, there is a lack of principled methods to predict energy consumption across different model configurations and hardware setups. We propose an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models based on computational complexity (FLOPs). Our approach decomposes diffusion model inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with the hypothesis that denoising operations dominate energy consumption due to their repeated execution across multiple inference steps. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Flux, and Qwen) on three GPU architectures (NVIDIA A100, A4000, A6000), spanning various inference configurations including resolution (256x256 to 1024x1024), precision (fp16/fp32), step counts (10-50), and classifier-free guidance settings. Our energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy within individual architectures (R-squared > 0.9) and exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations. These results validate the compute-bound nature of diffusion inference and provide a foundation for sustainable AI deployment planning and carbon footprint estimation.

Conclusion: 显式塑造局部几何结构是纯统计自监督学习正则化器的简单有效补充。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently advanced through non-contrastive methods that couple an invariance term with variance, covariance, or redundancy-reduction penalties. While such objectives shape first- and second-order statistics of the representation, they largely ignore the local geometry of the underlying data manifold. In this paper, we introduce CurvSSL, a curvature-regularized self-supervised learning framework, and its RKHS extension, kernel CurvSSL. Our approach retains a standard two-view encoder-projector architecture with a Barlow Twins-style redundancy-reduction loss on projected features, but augments it with a curvature-based regularizer. Each embedding is treated as a vertex whose $k$ nearest neighbors define a discrete curvature score via cosine interactions on the unit hypersphere; in the kernel variant, curvature is computed from a normalized local Gram matrix in an RKHS. These scores are aligned and decorrelated across augmentations by a Barlow-style loss on a curvature-derived matrix, encouraging both view invariance and consistency of local manifold bending. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with a ResNet-18 backbone show that curvature-regularized SSL yields competitive or improved linear evaluation performance compared to Barlow Twins and VICReg. Our results indicate that explicitly shaping local geometry is a simple and effective complement to purely statistical SSL regularizers.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for many clinical and research applications. However, achieving it remains costly and constrained by technical trade-offs and experimental limitations. Super-resolution (SR) presents a promising computational approach to overcome these challenges by generating HR images from more affordable low-resolution (LR) scans, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency without requiring additional hardware. This survey reviews recent advances in MRI SR techniques, with a focus on deep learning (DL) approaches. It examines DL-based MRI SR methods from the perspectives of computer vision, computational imaging, inverse problems, and MR physics, covering theoretical foundations, architectural designs, learning strategies, benchmark datasets, and performance metrics. We propose a systematic taxonomy to categorize these methods and present an in-depth study of both established and emerging SR techniques applicable to MRI, considering unique challenges in clinical and research contexts. We also highlight open challenges and directions that the community needs to address.

Abstract: Chest radiography remains one of the most widely used imaging modalities for thoracic diagnosis, yet increasing imaging volumes and radiologist workload continue to challenge timely interpretation. In this work, we investigate the use of MedImageInsight, a medical imaging foundational model, for automated binary classification of chest X-rays into Normal and Abnormal categories. Two approaches were evaluated: (1) fine-tuning MedImageInsight for end-to-end classification, and (2) employing the model as a feature extractor for a transfer learning pipeline using traditional machine learning classifiers. Experiments were conducted using a combination of the ChestX-ray14 dataset and real-world clinical data sourced from partner hospitals. The fine-tuned classifier achieved the highest performance, with an ROC-AUC of 0.888 and superior calibration compared to the transfer learning models, demonstrating performance comparable to established architectures such as CheXNet. These results highlight the effectiveness of foundational medical imaging models in reducing task-specific training requirements while maintaining diagnostic reliability. The system is designed for integration into web-based and hospital PACS workflows to support triage and reduce radiologist burden. Future work will extend the model to multi-label pathology classification to provide preliminary diagnostic interpretation in clinical environments.

Abstract: Emerging deep-learning-based lens library pre-training (LensLib-PT) pipeline offers a new avenue for blind lens aberration correction by training a universal neural network, demonstrating strong capability in handling diverse unknown optical degradations. This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib. The source code and datasets will be made publicly available at https://github.com/zju-jiangqi/OmniLens2.

TL;DR: 提出了VeilGen生成模型来模拟光学系统中的杂散光散射（veiling glare），并开发了DeVeiler恢复网络来去除这种退化，在紧凑光学系统中实现了优于现有方法的恢复质量和物理保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧凑光学系统（包括单透镜和超透镜）的成像性能不仅受到传统光学像差的影响，还受到来自非理想光学表面和涂层的杂散光散射（veiling glare）的进一步退化。这种复合退化破坏了传统透镜像差校正，但研究不足。

Method: 提出VeilGen生成模型，通过从目标图像中以无监督方式估计基础光学传输和眩光图来模拟veiling glare，并使用Stable Diffusion先验进行正则化。进一步提出DeVeiler恢复网络，利用可逆性约束和预测的潜在图来指导散射模型的逆过程。

Result: 在具有挑战性的紧凑光学系统上的广泛实验表明，该方法在恢复质量和物理保真度方面优于现有方法。VeilGen能够可靠地合成真实的veiling glare，其学习的潜在图能有效指导DeVeiler中的恢复过程。

Conclusion: VeilGen能够可靠地合成真实的veiling glare，其学习的潜在图能有效指导DeVeiler中的恢复过程。所有代码和数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: Beyond the commonly recognized optical aberrations, the imaging performance of compact optical systems-including single-lens and metalens designs-is often further degraded by veiling glare caused by stray-light scattering from non-ideal optical surfaces and coatings, particularly in complex real-world environments. This compound degradation undermines traditional lens aberration correction yet remains underexplored. A major challenge is that conventional scattering models (e.g., for dehazing) fail to fit veiling glare due to its spatial-varying and depth-independent nature. Consequently, paired high-quality data are difficult to prepare via simulation, hindering application of data-driven veiling glare removal models. To this end, we propose VeilGen, a generative model that learns to simulate veiling glare by estimating its underlying optical transmission and glare maps in an unsupervised manner from target images, regularized by Stable Diffusion (SD)-based priors. VeilGen enables paired dataset generation with realistic compound degradation of optical aberrations and veiling glare, while also providing the estimated latent optical transmission and glare maps to guide the veiling glare removal process. We further introduce DeVeiler, a restoration network trained with a reversibility constraint, which utilizes the predicted latent maps to guide an inverse process of the learned scattering model. Extensive experiments on challenging compact optical systems demonstrate that our approach delivers superior restoration quality and physical fidelity compared with existing methods. These suggest that VeilGen reliably synthesizes realistic veiling glare, and its learned latent maps effectively guide the restoration process in DeVeiler. All code and datasets will be publicly released at https://github.com/XiaolongQian/DeVeiler.

### [182] [The Shifting Landscape of Vaccine Discourse: Insights From a Decade of Pre- to Post-COVID-19 Vaccine Posts on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16832)
*Nikesh Gyawali,Doina Caragea,Cornelia Caragea,Saif M. Mohammad*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 分析2013-2022年社交媒体上疫苗话语的演变，发现COVID-19大流行导致用户情感和话语的复杂变化，包括负面情绪减少、信任相关词汇增加，以及后期负面词汇上升反映疫苗犹豫。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究英语社交媒体用户在COVID-19大流行前后对疫苗话语的演变，基于社会认知和刻板印象内容模型理论，理解社交媒体上疫苗叙事的动态变化。

Method: 构建包含1870万条疫苗相关推文的新数据集，覆盖2013-2022年，使用社会心理学理论分析用户情感和语言特征的变化。

Result: 大流行期间负面情绪词汇减少，惊讶和信任相关情绪词汇增加；早期使用更多温暖、信任和积极能力相关词汇，后期负面词汇显著上升。

Conclusion: COVID-19大流行显著改变了社交媒体上的疫苗话语模式，反映了用户对疫苗认知和态度的复杂演变过程，后期负面词汇增加可能表明疫苗犹豫和怀疑情绪的增长。

Abstract: In this work, we study English-language vaccine discourse in social media posts, specifically posts on X (formerly Twitter), in seven years before the COVID-19 outbreak (2013 to 2019) and three years after the outbreak was first reported (2020 to 2022). Drawing on theories from social cognition and the stereotype content model in Social Psychology, we analyze how English speakers talk about vaccines on social media to understand the evolving narrative around vaccines in social media posts. To do that, we first introduce a novel dataset comprising 18.7 million curated posts on vaccine discourse from 2013 to 2022. This extensive collection-filtered down from an initial 129 million posts through rigorous preprocessing-captures both pre-COVID and COVID-19 periods, offering valuable insights into the evolution of English-speaking X users' perceptions related to vaccines. Our analysis shows that the COVID-19 pandemic led to complex shifts in X users' sentiment and discourse around vaccines. We observe that negative emotion word usage decreased during the pandemic, with notable rises in usage of surprise, and trust related emotion words. Furthermore, vaccine-related language tended to use more warmth-focused words associated with trustworthiness, along with positive, competence-focused words during the early days of the pandemic, with a marked rise in negative word usage towards the end of the pandemic, possibly reflecting a growing vaccine hesitancy and skepticism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI科学家系统将科学发现视为独立的搜索或优化问题，忽视了科学研究本质上是社会性和协作性的，缺乏对科学基础设施（如协作机制、贡献归属、同行评审）的建模。

Method: 构建OmniScientist框架，包含：(1)基于引文网络和概念关联的结构化知识系统；(2)支持多智能体协作和人类参与的协作研究协议(OSP)；(3)基于盲对用户投票和Elo排名的开放评估平台(ScienceArena)。

Conclusion: OmniScientist通过显式编码人类研究机制到AI科学工作流中，弥补了现有系统的不足，为建立真正的科研生态系统提供了基础设施支持。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI agents have demonstrated increasing proficiency in scientific tasks, ranging from hypothesis generation and experimental design to manuscript writing. Such agent systems are commonly referred to as "AI Scientists." However, existing AI Scientists predominantly formulate scientific discovery as a standalone search or optimization problem, overlooking the fact that scientific research is inherently a social and collaborative endeavor. Real-world science relies on a complex scientific infrastructure composed of collaborative mechanisms, contribution attribution, peer review, and structured scientific knowledge networks. Due to the lack of modeling for these critical dimensions, current systems struggle to establish a genuine research ecosystem or interact deeply with the human scientific community. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniScientist, a framework that explicitly encodes the underlying mechanisms of human research into the AI scientific workflow. OmniScientist not only achieves end-to-end automation across data foundation, literature review, research ideation, experiment automation, scientific writing, and peer review, but also provides comprehensive infrastructural support by simulating the human scientific system, comprising: (1) a structured knowledge system built upon citation networks and conceptual correlations; (2) a collaborative research protocol (OSP), which enables seamless multi-agent collaboration and human researcher participation; and (3) an open evaluation platform (ScienceArena) based on blind pairwise user voting and Elo rankings. This infrastructure empowers agents to not only comprehend and leverage human knowledge systems but also to collaborate and co-evolve, fostering a sustainable and scalable innovation ecosystem.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个多层审计平台，用于系统评估中国和西方来源的大语言模型在跨文化价值观对齐方面的表现，发现普遍存在价值系统不稳定、年轻群体代表性不足等问题，同时揭示了不同地区模型的发展轨迹差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在关键决策中影响力增强，确保其与多元文化价值观对齐已成为重要治理挑战，需要系统评估不同文化背景模型的价值观对齐情况。

Method: 采用四种集成方法：伦理困境语料库评估时间稳定性、多样性增强框架量化文化保真度、首词概率对齐评估分布准确性、多阶段推理框架提供可解释决策。

Result: 分析20多个领先模型发现普遍挑战：价值系统基础不稳定、年轻群体系统性代表性不足、模型规模与对齐质量非线性关系；中国模型强调多语言数据集成，西方模型架构实验更多但存在美国中心偏见；Mistral架构在跨文化对齐上优于LLaMA3，全参数微调优于人类反馈强化学习。

Conclusion: 当前没有一种范式能够实现稳健的跨文化泛化，需要更系统的方法来确保大语言模型与多元文化价值观的有效对齐。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly influence high-stakes decision-making across global contexts, ensuring their alignment with diverse cultural values has become a critical governance challenge. This study presents a Multi-Layered Auditing Platform for Responsible AI that systematically evaluates cross-cultural value alignment in China-origin and Western-origin LLMs through four integrated methodologies: Ethical Dilemma Corpus for assessing temporal stability, Diversity-Enhanced Framework (DEF) for quantifying cultural fidelity, First-Token Probability Alignment for distributional accuracy, and Multi-stAge Reasoning frameworK (MARK) for interpretable decision-making. Our comparative analysis of 20+ leading models, such as Qwen, GPT-4o, Claude, LLaMA, and DeepSeek, reveals universal challenges-fundamental instability in value systems, systematic under-representation of younger demographics, and non-linear relationships between model scale and alignment quality-alongside divergent regional development trajectories. While China-origin models increasingly emphasize multilingual data integration for context-specific optimization, Western models demonstrate greater architectural experimentation but persistent U.S.-centric biases. Neither paradigm achieves robust cross-cultural generalization. We establish that Mistral-series architectures significantly outperform LLaMA3-series in cross-cultural alignment, and that Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning on diverse datasets surpasses Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback in preserving cultural variation...

Conclusion: MusicAIR作为协同创作工具，可成为可靠的音乐创作助手和教育导师，显著降低音乐创作门槛，对AI音乐生成领域做出重要贡献。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have made music generation a prominent research focus. However, many neural-based models rely on large datasets, raising concerns about copyright infringement and high-performance costs. In contrast, we propose MusicAIR, an innovative multimodal AI music generation framework powered by a novel algorithm-driven symbolic music core, effectively mitigating copyright infringement risks. The music core algorithms connect critical lyrical and rhythmic information to automatically derive musical features, creating a complete, coherent melodic score solely from the lyrics. The MusicAIR framework facilitates music generation from lyrics, text, and images. The generated score adheres to established principles of music theory, lyrical structure, and rhythmic conventions. We developed Generate AI Music (GenAIM), a web tool using MusicAIR for lyric-to-song, text-to-music, and image-to-music generation. In our experiments, we evaluated AI-generated music scores produced by the system using both standard music metrics and innovative analysis that compares these compositions with original works. The system achieves an average key confidence of 85%, outperforming human composers at 79%, and aligns closely with established music theory standards, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse, human-like compositions. As a co-pilot tool, GenAIM can serve as a reliable music composition assistant and a possible educational composition tutor while simultaneously lowering the entry barrier for all aspiring musicians, which is innovative and significantly contributes to AI for music generation.

TL;DR: Cognitive BASIC是一种基于BASIC风格的提示语言和模型内解释器，它将大语言模型的推理过程结构化，形成明确的逐步执行轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受复古BASIC简单性的启发，旨在为LLM推理创建一个可解释的认知控制层，使多步推理过程更加透明。

Method: 使用编号行和简单命令作为认知控制层，通过自然语言解释器文件定义命令语义、内存更新和日志行为，让LLM能够可靠地模拟短程序。

Result: 在三个LLM上的基准测试显示，所有模型都能执行Cognitive BASIC程序，整体性能强劲但不均衡，能够提取陈述性和程序性知识，检测矛盾并在必要时产生解决方案。

Conclusion: Cognitive BASIC成功地将LLM推理结构化，实现了透明且可解释的多步推理过程，为模型认知控制提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Cognitive BASIC is a minimal, BASIC-style prompting language and in-model interpreter that structures large language model (LLM) reasoning into explicit, stepwise execution traces. Inspired by the simplicity of retro BASIC, we repurpose numbered lines and simple commands as an interpretable cognitive control layer. Modern LLMs can reliably simulate such short programs, enabling transparent multi-step reasoning inside the model. A natural-language interpreter file specifies command semantics, memory updates, and logging behavior. Our mental-model interpreter extracts declarative and procedural knowledge, detects contradictions, and produces resolutions when necessary. A comparison across three LLMs on a benchmark of knowledge extraction, conflict detection, and reasoning tasks shows that all models can execute Cognitive BASIC programs, with overall strong but not uniform performance.

Abstract: Benchmarks are pivotal in driving AI progress, and invalid benchmark questions frequently undermine their reliability. Manually identifying and correcting errors among thousands of benchmark questions is not only infeasible but also a critical bottleneck for reliable evaluation. In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\% precision. In addition, we introduce an LLM-judge first pass to review questions, further reducing human effort. Together, these components provide an efficient and scalable framework for systematic benchmark revision.

Motivation: 通用LLM智能体框架(如ReAct或角色扮演)在需要严格结构化工作流程的专业领域表现不佳，特别是在遥感等需要专业工具和多步骤程序的领域。

Method: 引入层次任务抽象机制(HTAM)，将多智能体系统构建为反映领域内在任务依赖关系的逻辑层次结构，确保程序正确性并将复杂问题分解为顺序层。

Result: 在GeoPlan-bench基准测试中，EarthAgent在工具选择、路径相似性和逻辑完整性等指标上显著优于现有系统。

Conclusion: 将智能体架构与领域内在任务结构对齐是构建稳健可靠的专业自主系统的关键步骤。

Abstract: LLM-driven agents, particularly those using general frameworks like ReAct or human-inspired role-playing, often struggle in specialized domains that necessitate rigorously structured workflows. Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces Generative Augmented Reality (GAR) as a next-generation paradigm that reframes augmentation as a process of world re-synthesis rather than world composition by a conventional AR engine. GAR replaces the conventional AR engine's multi-stage modules with a unified generative backbone, where environmental sensing, virtual content, and interaction signals are jointly encoded as conditioning inputs for continuous video generation. We formalize the computational correspondence between AR and GAR, survey the technical foundations that make real-time generative augmentation feasible, and outline prospective applications that leverage its unified inference model. We envision GAR as a future AR paradigm that delivers high-fidelity experiences in terms of realism, interactivity, and immersion, while eliciting new research challenges on technologies, content ecosystems, and the ethical and societal implications.

Motivation: 评估治疗前MRI描述符与乳腺癌新辅助化疗病理完全缓解的关联，以改进治疗反应预测模型。

Method: 回顾性单中心研究，纳入2016-2020年接受新辅助化疗的乳腺癌患者，使用标准化BI-RADS和乳腺水肿评分描述MRI特征，进行单变量和多变量逻辑回归分析，并训练随机森林分类器预测pCR。

Result: 在129例乳腺癌中，46%达到pCR。单变量分析显示椭圆形或圆形、单灶性、非毛刺边缘、无相关非肿块强化和较小MRI尺寸与pCR显著相关。多变量分析中单灶性和非毛刺边缘保持独立关联。结合MRI特征显著提高了随机森林模型的敏感性、特异性和精确度。

Conclusion: 非毛刺边缘和单灶性是pCR的独立预测因素，结合MRI特征可提高乳腺癌新辅助化疗反应预测模型的性能。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the association between pretreatment MRI descriptors and breast cancer (BC) pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Materials \& Methods: Patients with BC treated by NAC with a breast MRI between 2016 and 2020 were included in this retrospective observational single-center study. MR studies were described using the standardized BI-RADS and breast edema score on T2-weighted MRI. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess variables association with pCR according to residual cancer burden. Random forest classifiers were trained to predict pCR on a random split including 70% of the database and were validated on the remaining cases. Results: Among 129 BC, 59 (46%) achieved pCR after NAC (luminal (n=7/37, 19%), triple negative (TN) (n=30/55, 55%), HER2+ (n=22/37, 59%). Clinical and biological items associated with pCR were BC subtype (p<0.001), T stage 0/I/II (p=0.008), higher Ki67 (p=0.005) and higher tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes levels (p=0.016). Univariate analysis showed that the following MRI features, oval or round shape (p=0.047), unifocality (p=0.026), non-spiculated margins (p=0.018), no associated non-mass enhancement (NME) (p = 0.024) and a lower MRI size (p = 0.031) were significantly associated with pCR. Unifocality and non-spiculated margins remained independently associated with pCR at multivariable analysis. Adding significant MRI features to clinicobiological variables in random forest classifiers significantly increased sensitivity (0.67 versus 0.62), specificity (0.69 versus 0.67) and precision (0.71 versus 0.67) for pCR prediction. Conclusion: Non-spiculated margins and unifocality are independently associated with pCR and can increase models performance to predict BC response to NAC. Clinical Relevance Statement: A multimodal approach integrating pretreatment MRI features with clinicobiological predictors, including TILs, could be employed to develop machine learning models for identifying patients at risk of non-response. This may enable consideration of alternative therapeutic strategies to optimize treatment outcomes

Research on total (admissible) orderings of such types of fuzzy subsets, and specifically those belonging to the set $\mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\rightarrow Y_m}$ consisting of discrete fuzzy numbers $A$ whose support is a closed subinterval of the finite chain $L_n = \{0, 1, \ldots, n\}$ and whose membership values $A(x)$, for $x \in L_n$, belong to the set $Y_m = \{ 0 = y_1 < y_2 < \cdots < y_{m-1} < y_m = 1 \}$, has facilitated the development of new methods for constructing logical connectives, based on a bijective function, called $\textit{pos function}$, that determines the position of each $A \in \mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\rightarrow Y_m}$. For this reason, in this work we revisit the problem by introducing algorithms that exploit the combinatorial structure of total (admissible) orders to compute the $\textit{pos}$ function and its inverse with exactness. The proposed approach achieves a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^{2} m \log n)$, which is quadratic in the size of the underlying chain ($n$) and linear in the number of membership levels ($m$). The key point is that the dominant factor is $m$, ensuring scalability with respect to the granularity of membership values. The results demonstrate that this formulation substantially reduces computational cost and enables the efficient implementation of algebraic operations -- such as aggregation and implication -- on the set of discrete fuzzy numbers.
